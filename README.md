# LPL 2024 "Hackarama"

## The Problem
Everyday there are thousands of articles published about market conditions, individual stocks, or political events – but there is no efficient way to absorb all of this information. Additionally, a lot of the information is useless depending on the markets the financial advisor and/or client are invested in. Shouldn’t there be an easier way for both financial advisors and their clients to easily find the specific information they are curious about?

## Our Solution
1. Easily search and read through hundreds of financial articles from Yahoo Finance, CNBC, and Investing.com all in one "portal"
2. Ask any question and have a conversation in natural language about the content in the articles utilizing artificial intelligence and a modern chat interface
