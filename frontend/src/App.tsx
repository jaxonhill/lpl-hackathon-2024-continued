			"PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — An Oregon weekly newspaper that had to lay off its entire staff after its funds were embezzled by a former employee will relaunch its print edition next month, its editor said, a move made possible in large part by fundraising campaigns and community contributions.\nThe Eugene Weekly will return to newsstands on Feb. 8 with roughly 25,000 copies, about six weeks after the embezzlement forced the decades-old publication to halt its print edition, editor Camilla Mortensen said.\n“It has been both terrifying and wonderful,” Mortensen told The Associated Press, describing the emotional rollercoaster of the last few weeks. “I thought it was hard to run a paper. It's much harder to resurrect a paper.”\nThe alternative weekly, founded in 1982 and distributed for free in Eugene, one of the largest cities in Oregon, had to lay off its entire 10-person staff right before Christmas. It was around that time that the paper became aware of at least $100,000 in unpaid bills and discovered that a now-former employee who had been involved with the paper's finances had used its bank account to pay themselves around $90,000, Mortensen said.\nAdditionally, multiple employees, including Mortensen, realized that money from their paychecks that was supposed to be going into retirement accounts was never deposited.\nThe accused employee was fired after the embezzlement came to light.\nThe news was a devastating blow to a publication that serves as an important source of information in a community that, like many others nationwide, is struggling with growing gaps in local news coverage.\nThe Eugene police department’s investigation is still ongoing, and forensic accountants hired by the paper are continuing to piece together what happened.\nLocal Eugene news outlets KEZI and KLCC were among the first to report the weekly's return to print.\nSince the layoffs, some former staff members have continued to volunteer their time to help keep the paper's website up and running. Much of the online content published in recent weeks has been work from journalism students at the University of Oregon, located in Eugene, and from freelancers who offered to submit stories for free — “the journalistic equivalent of pro bono,” Mortensen said.\nSome former employees had to find other jobs in order to make ends meet. But Mortensen hopes to eventually rehire her staff once the paper pays its outstanding bills and becomes more financially sustainable.\nThe paper has raised roughly $150,000 since December, Mortensen said. The majority of the money came from an online GoFundMe campaign, but financial support also came from local businesses, artists and readers. The paper even received checks from people living as far away as Iowa and New York after news outlets across the country picked up the story.\n“People were so invested in helping us that it just really gives me hope for journalism at a time where I think a lot of people don't have hope,\" she told the AP. “When we saw how many people contributed and how many people continue to offer to help, you can't not try to print the paper. You've got to give it a shot.”\nThe paper aims to continue weekly printing beyond Feb. 8.",

It follows the arrest of three Machado aides for their alleged involvement in what the government said was a plot to kill Maduro.\nThe State Department said Friday’s court process “lacked basic elements, as Machado neither received a copy of the allegations against her nor was afforded the opportunity to respond to those allegations.” As a result of recent events, “the United States is currently reviewing our Venezuela sanctions policy.”\nThe court said on Friday it was ratifying a 2021 decision by the Comptroller’s Office that barred Machado, who’s been leading opinion polls for the election, from running for public office for 15 years.\n“Maduro and his criminal system decided to take the worst path for them: that of a fraudulent election,” Machado wrote in a statement posted on social media, promising to keep fighting for free elections. “Let there be no doubt, we’re going until the end.”\nWhile Machado said the court’s decision effectively killed the so-called Barbados deal between the US and Venezuela, Maduro’s chief negotiator Jorge Rodriguez said the government has complied with the mechanism established in the agreement, and will carry out elections this year as promised.\nDespite Venezuela’s moves, bond investors have mostly held onto their bets that the sanctions will remain suspended. Government notes due in 2027 were quoted late Friday at 21.4 cents, according to indicative pricing compiled by Bloomberg, 2 cents lower than their high earlier this month but still far above the 10-cent range where they traded before the Barbados agreement.\n--With assistance from Patricia Laya and Nicolle Yapur.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow a Lucky Break Fueled Eli Lilly’s $600 Billion Weight-Loss Empire\nHow the West’s Favorite Autocrat Engineered Africa’s Most Dramatic Turnaround\nAI Needs So Much Power That Old Coal Plants Are Sticking Around\nWhy Did Car Insurance Get So Expensive?\nAmerican Workers Come Out Winners in a Clash Between Economists Over a Curve\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

			"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve policymakers may finally be right on the verge of cutting interest rates.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nGiuliani Lists Yankees Loot, Trump Claim as Assets in Bankruptcy\nUS Fires on Houthi Missile Hours After Trafigura Ship Attack\nMacKenzie Scott Pares Her Amazon Stake by $10 Billion\nGas-Addicted Europe Trades One Energy Risk for Another\nPutin Sends US Signal on Ukraine Talks, Seeing War Advantage\nGoing into this week’s two-day policy meeting, which wraps Wednesday afternoon in Washington, investors are assigning roughly even odds to the prospect that the US central bank will start lowering borrowing costs at its next decision in March.\nThat makes Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference, and any signal he may or may not choose to send, of critical importance. It all comes down to how Powell and his colleagues have been reading the recent spate of economic data.\nOn one hand, inflation numbers continue to surprise to the downside. The Fed’s preferred gauge decelerated to 2.9% in December, crossing below 3% for the first time since early 2021, according to data published Friday.\nOn the other, consumer spending continues to be surprisingly robust. It’s undoubtedly getting a boost from the downdraft in inflation, but the strength still may keep some worried that price pressures could mount once again.\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says:\n“The stage is set for the Fed to take steps toward cutting rates in coming months. We expect the Fed to begin lowering the federal funds rate target range in March as it attempts to stick a soft landing.”\n—Stuart Paul and Estelle Ou. For full analysis, click here\nFed decision aside, we’ll get more US data in the week ahead. Most important will be the monthly jobs report on Friday. Job openings and consumer confidence data on Tuesday — and a quarterly employment cost index release on Wednesday, during the Fed meeting — will also help inform how strong the outlook for spending really is.\nFor more, read Bloomberg Economics’ full Week Ahead for the US\nTurning north, Statistics Canada releases gross domestic product data by industry for November, after three consecutive months of flat growth. The economy would be shrinking, if not for a massive population surge led by uncontrolled temporary migration.\nElsewhere, central bank decisions in the UK and Sweden may keep rates on hold while three Latin American central banks are set to cut.\nEuro-zone inflation and GDP data, and Chinese business surveys will also focus investors, and the International Monetary Fund published new forecasts on Tuesday.\nClick here for what happened last week and below is our wrap of what’s coming up in the global economy.\nAsia\nChina releases purchasing manager indexes on Wednesday that will shed light on the current state of the world’s second-largest economy.\nBoth the manufacturing and service sectors have weakened since September, with falls in factory activity deepening amid continued chatter over the need for more stimulus to support sputtering growth.\nThe official readings will be followed by private sector PMI reports for China and the corresponding figures for other countries in a region that has shown sluggish activity levels, partly due to their giant neighbor’s lack of zip.\nThe week kicks off with the first decision by the Monetary Authority of Singapore since it switched to quarterly meetings and long-running chief Ravi Menon departed.\nA summary of opinions from Bank of Japan board members at its January gathering will offer further clues to how close the central bank is to its first rate hike since 2007. March or April are seen as very much live meetings.\nThe Philippines, Taiwan and Hong Kong release economic growth results for the fourth quarter during the week.\nAustralia’s quarterly inflation figures are due Wednesday with a further cooling expected just a few days before the central bank decides policy at its first meeting of the year.\nSouth Korean trade figures offering a pulse check on global trade, and inflation data round out the week.\nFor more, read Bloomberg Economics’ full Week Ahead for Asia\nEurope, Middle East, Africa\nThree central bank decisions will draw attention in Europe:\nThe Bank of England could step back from its threat to raise rates again if needed after UK wage growth cooled at one of the fastest paces on record. There’s reason for caution though, not least after data showed an unexpected pickup in inflation last month. That’s on Thursday.\nRiksbank officials have already indicated that it won’t be necessary to lift borrowing costs again, but their decision the same day could reveal how determined they are to keep rates high for now.\nIn Hungary on Tuesday, policymakers could follow through with another reduction in borrowing costs. Most economists are anticipating a 100 basis-point move down to 9.75%.\nThe week is also significant for data, with countries across the European Union set to release both growth and inflation numbers.\nBelgium and Sweden will publish such reports on Monday, followed the next day by several countries including Germany, France, Italy and Spain.\nFor the euro zone, economists anticipate the outcome to be a second quarterly contraction of 0.1% — meeting the typical definition of a recession.\nInflation reports from around the region are also due, culminating in the result for the currency zone as a whole on Thursday.\nA reading of 2.7% is expected there — still noticeably above the European Central Bank’s target — while the so-called core gauge that strips out energy and such volatile elements may remain even higher.\nBeyond Europe, several other central banks will make announcements too:\nThe Bank of Ghana’s decision on Monday is a close call on a possible cut. Inflation is continuing to slow, making its real rates among the world’s highest. Even so, the IMF has cautioned against loosening.\nThe same day, Zimbabwe could explain its plans to handle a rout in the currency, which is down more than a third against the dollar on the official market so far this year.\nLesotho which has its currency pegged to South Africa’s rand, may follow its neighbor on Tuesday and hold its key rate at 7.75% to support its economy.\nOn Wednesday, Mozambique is likely to keep borrowing costs unchanged to contain inflation even after the IMF said it has room to cut.\nEgyptian officials will meet the next day amid the worst economic crisis in decades, with investors ultimately anticipating a devaluation. While talks with the IMF continue, the central bank may still keep its rate at 19.25%.\nAmong data highlights, data on Wednesday may show Saudi Arabia’s economy shrank for a second straight quarter at the end of 2023 after a contraction that mostly reflected a cut in oil production to push up prices. That’s turned it from one of the Group of 20’s fastest-growing members to one of its laggards.\nFor more, read Bloomberg Economics’ full Week Ahead for EMEA\nLatin America\nBanco Central do Brasil has telegraphed delivery of a fifth straight half-point rate cut Wednesday to 11.25% and a sixth lined up for the March meeting.\nAnalysts surveyed by the bank see 9% by year-end but little leeway thereafter given sticky inflation expectations.\nBrazil also reports out December year-end industrial production and national unemployment.\nColombia’s central bank is also all but certain to cut for a second straight month though analysts differ over the size of the reduction. A lower-than-expected December inflation reading my persuade the bank to go for a half-point trim to 12.5%.\nBanco Central de Chile has far more room for maneuver and may vote for a 100 basis-point move lower to 7.25%. Economists surveyed by the bank see inflation back to the 3% target this year.\nOn the inflation front, data for Lima, Peru’s megacity capital, may show that consumer price increases picked up from December’s 3.24% reading. Brazil reports out its less-closely watched IGP-M price index, the country’s broadest measure of inflation.\nRounding out the week, Mexico’s flash reading on fourth-quarter output should show a quarter-on-quarter downshift from the 1.1% pace seen in the three months through September, slowed by more than a year of double-digit borrowing costs.\nFor more, read Bloomberg Economics’ full Week Ahead for Latin America\n--With assistance from Robert Jameson, Piotr Skolimowski, Laura Dhillon Kane, Paul Jackson and Monique Vanek.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow a Lucky Break Fueled Eli Lilly’s $600 Billion Weight-Loss Empire\nHow the West’s Favorite Autocrat Engineered Africa’s Most Dramatic Turnaround\nAI Needs So Much Power That Old Coal Plants Are Sticking Around\nWhy Did Car Insurance Get So Expensive?\nAmerican Workers Come Out Winners in a Clash Between Economists Over a Curve\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

It was incredible.\n\"It was important to take the points tonight but we also needed to keep the car on the road. I had a good feeling, so I went for it and it seems like it paid off.\"\nToyota's reigning champion Kalle Rovanpera is absent from the opening round as part of the Finn's decision to run only a part-time programme this year, leaving Evans as the team's main title contender.\n\"It’s not been the best day for us.

While Christine Lagarde pushed back less forcefully than expected against market bets on a cut in the spring, the institution didn’t provide any formal guidance and other policymakers have taken a more cautious stance.\nSpeaking in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Friday, Latvia’s Governing Council member Martins Kazaks said the worst mistake would be to start lowering borrowing costs too early and allow inflation to return.\nVilleroy tempered his colleague’s concern, saying there are also risks that keeping policy too tight for too long inflicts undue damage on the economy.\n“We will have avoid two risks that have become balanced: cutting too soon and missing the target, but also acting too late and excessively slowing activity,” he said.\nHe said the central bank will decide when it lowers rates based on progress toward its 2% inflation target. Currently, policymakers are closely watching the impact on prices and the economy from tensions in the Middle East.\n“We are vigilant, notably concerning eventual consequences of the situation in the Middle East,” Villeroy said. “But in that case, we would adapt, notably regarding the calendar of rate cuts.”\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow a Lucky Break Fueled Eli Lilly’s $600 Billion Weight-Loss Empire\nHow the West’s Favorite Autocrat Engineered Africa’s Most Dramatic Turnaround\nAI Needs So Much Power That Old Coal Plants Are Sticking Around\nWhy Did Car Insurance Get So Expensive?\nAmerican Workers Come Out Winners in a Clash Between Economists Over a Curve\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

			"(Bloomberg) -- The US is aiming to announce major chip grants by the end of March, people familiar with the plans said, paving the way to send billions of dollars to semiconductor makers in a bid to supercharge domestic production.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nGiuliani Lists Yankees Loot, Trump Claim as Assets in Bankruptcy\nUS Fires on Houthi Missile Hours After Trafigura Ship Attack\nMacKenzie Scott Pares Her Amazon Stake by $10 Billion\nGas-Addicted Europe Trades One Energy Risk for Another\nPutin Sends US Signal on Ukraine Talks, Seeing War Advantage\nThe awards — slated to go to Intel Corp. and other chipmakers — are a central piece of the 2022 Chips and Science Act, which set aside $39 billion in direct grants to revitalize US manufacturing.\nIntel has said that the grants will determine how quickly it progresses with expansion projects, including a planned facility in Ohio that would be the world’s largest. Overseas chipmakers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. also are expected to get a portion of the funds, helping them pay for factories in the US.\nThe money has been slow to trickle out so far, with only two small grants announced more than a year after Biden signed the landmark initiative into law. The effort, aimed at rebalancing what’s seen in Washington as a dangerous concentration of production in East Asia, is a key pillar of Biden’s economic message heading into the November election. It brings promises of thousands of well-paying factory jobs in new manufacturing hubs across the country.\nThe timing suggests the awards may be unveiled before President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address on March 7. Spokespeople for the White House and Intel declined to comment.\nRead more: Ex-Bankers Help Divvy Up $100 Billion to Boost US Chipmaking\nCommerce Secretary Gina Raimondo has said her agency plans to make about a dozen awards this year, including several multibillion-dollar grants to support advanced chipmaking facilities. The awards, which could come as a combination of grants, loans and loan guarantees, will cover up to 15% of project costs. The Commerce Department declined to comment.\nFor chipmakers, the disbursements will help cushion the financial impact of building facilities that can cost as much as $30 billion and yet be obsolete within a decade. Semiconductor companies have pledged to invest more than $230 billion in the US in recent years, many on the explicit condition that they receive government support.\nIntel Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger has been the leading industry voice lobbying for that funding. His company, once the world’s biggest chipmaker, has fallen behind rivals and a construction spree is part of Gelsinger’s comeback plan.\nIntel is building or planning factories in Arizona and Ohio, as well as a new site in Germany — where the CEO is counting on European support.\nTSMC, the world’s largest manufacturer of chips, plans to spend $40 billion to build two fabrication facilities in Arizona. But the company has delayed the start of production at both sites due to labor and cost challenges at the first one. It said recently that US incentives will help determine how advanced the technology inside the second facility will be.\nThe projects in Arizona and Ohio carry significant electoral weight: Biden won the first state by just 10,000 votes in 2020, and manufacturing will be a central theme of a key Senate race in Ohio.\nGovernments around the world, meanwhile, have been plowing ahead with their own chip programs. Several have inked agreements with the biggest names in the industry and promised to cover as much as half of construction costs.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported earlier Sunday that the grants to help build new factories may arrive in coming weeks.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow a Lucky Break Fueled Eli Lilly’s $600 Billion Weight-Loss Empire\nHow the West’s Favorite Autocrat Engineered Africa’s Most Dramatic Turnaround\nAI Needs So Much Power That Old Coal Plants Are Sticking Around\nWhy Did Car Insurance Get So Expensive?\nAmerican Workers Come Out Winners in a Clash Between Economists Over a Curve\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",
