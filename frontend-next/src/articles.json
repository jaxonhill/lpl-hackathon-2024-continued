The price of bitcoin has more than doubled since the start of 2023, but it's still well below its November 2021 peak.At least nine asset management firms \u2014 including BlackRock, WisdomTree, Valkyrie and others \u2014 are waiting for Securities and Exchange Commission approval to issue a spot bitcoin ETF.

        "article_content": "Getty ImagesOpen enrollment season can be a time of trepidation for the self-employed.\u00a0The stakes are especially high because if you need to buy individual or family coverage, the next few weeks could be your only chance for 2024, barring certain exceptions such as moving to a different state, getting married, divorced or having a child.\u00a0\"For most people, the nationwide open enrollment period for individual and family coverage is your best shot to review your options and enroll in a new plan,\" explained Anthony Lopez, vice president of individual and family and small business plans at eHealth, a private online marketplace for health insurance, in an email.More from Year-End PlanningHere's a look at more coverage on what to do finance-wise as the end of the year approaches:A market rally is the time to use this \u2018strategic chess move\u2019 for capital gainsThis is the biggest year-end tax issue for high-net-worth clients, advisor saysHere\u2019s how much you can make in 2024 and still pay 0% capital gains taxesPicking health insurance on your own \u2014 without the help of a human resources department \u2014 can be daunting. Instead of throwing up your hands in frustration, here are answers to questions self-employed individuals often have about open enrollment.Healthcare.gov and other options for informationFreelancers, consultants, independent contractors and other self-employed individuals can visit www.healthcare.gov to research and enroll in flexible, high-quality health coverage, either through the federal government or their state, depending on where they live. You can also choose to work directly with an insurance agent or with a private online marketplace to help you wade through options. To be considered self-employed, you can't have anyone working for you. If you have even one employee, you may be able to use the SHOP Marketplace for small businesses.\u00a0The deadlines you need to stay on top ofMost states set a deadline of Dec. 15 for coverage that begins Jan. 1, so don't delay when it comes to signing up for benefits, said Alexa Irish, co-chief executive of Catch, which helps self-employed individuals choose health-care plans. Also, remember to pay your first month's premium before your health care is supposed to start or you'll be out of luck as well. \"If you miss those deadlines, there's no wiggle room,\" said Laura Speyer, co-CEO of Catch.If you are already enrolled in a marketplace planThose who were already enrolled in a plan last year can\u00a0make changes\u00a0by Dec. 15 for coverage that begins Jan. 1. Doing nothing will mean they are automatically reenrolled in last year's marketplace plan.\u00a0Qualifying for tax credits and other savingsMany people assume they won't be entitled to savings, but they should still investigate their options, Irish said. Indeed, 91% of total marketplace enrollees received an advance premium tax credit in February 2023, which lowers their monthly health insurance payment, according to data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, a federal agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.Credits and other eligible savings are available based on an applicant's income and household size and can be estimated even before they officially apply. It's advisable to check for savings possibilities every year, Irish said.What to consider in making coverage decisionsThe thought process will be similar to what you went through when picking health insurance offered by an employer. Whether you are signing up for the first time \u2014 or deciding whether to renew your existing plan or choose a different one \u2014 you'll want to consider factors such as who in the family needs the coverage and for what purposes, and how different plans compare in terms of coverage options and cost. This analysis needs to take into account copays, prescription drugs you take or may start to take, whether the plan covers your doctors, and out-of-pocket maximums.\u00a0If you're self-employed and aiming to grow your business in the coming year, possibly by hiring employees, it's good to know you can enroll in a small business plan at any time of the year, Lopez said. \"Small business group plans aren't governed by the same open enrollment rules as individual and family plans. So, you can enroll in an individual plan today, then switch over to a group plan in mid-2024 if you add a couple employees and want to provide them with health benefits,\" he said.How much health insurance costs the self-employedCost will vary, depending on the plan you choose, who is covered and what subsidies you're eligible for. But, as a general guide, the average total monthly premium before tax subsidies in February 2023 was $604.78. The average total premium per month paid by consumers after the tax subsidies was $123.69, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.Self-employed individuals may also be eligible for a cost-sharing reduction, a discount that lowers the amount paid for deductibles, copayments and coinsurance. You'll find out what you qualify for when you fill out a marketplace application, but keep in mind, you need to enroll in a \"Silver\" plan, one of four categories of marketplace plans, to get the cost-sharing reduction.\u00a0Wading through policy options, working with an agentYou don't have to go through the process alone. There are assisters who are trained and certified by marketplaces to help you apply and enroll. If you want more specific help, you can also choose to work with an agent or broker who is trained and certified to sell marketplace health plans in the state they are licensed. Agents can advise you and give you more detailed information about the plans they sell, and since health insurance premiums are regulated by your state's Department of Insurance, you don't have to worry about paying more by working with an agent.watch nowVIDEO2:4602:46A walk through the benefits of employer-sponsored emergency savings accountsThe ExchangeA few things to note: Some agents may offer other plans that aren't available on government exchanges, but that comply with government requirements. However, to take advantage of a premium tax credit and other savings, you must enroll for a plan through a state or federal marketplace, on your own or through an agent.\u00a0The risk and reward of high-deductible plansMarketplaces offer multiple plans to choose from and they will vary in terms of coverage and price. One option that's becoming more popular, especially with young entrepreneurs, is called a high-deductible health insurance plan. This type of insurance plan comes with higher deductibles in exchange for lower premiums, which could be a good choice for people who are healthy and don't visit the doctor much. Another benefit of a qualified high-deductible plan is the ability to contribute to a tax-advantaged savings vehicle known as a health savings account, or HSA.\u00a0When deciding whether to choose a high-deductible plan, individuals should take into account factors such as how often they visit the doctor, how much they can afford to pay out of pocket, whether their doctors are in network and what the out-of-pocket maximums are. It's also important to know you have the means to cover a high-cost medical event, should the need arise.\u00a0If a high-deductible plan makes sense for your circumstances, you can then consider an HSA.Lopez recommends people don't delay when it comes to reviewing their coverage options, which may also include dental and vision insurance. \"The last week or so of open enrollment can be a busy time for licensed agents too; if you want the best chance of talking to an agent to get your personal questions answered, don't put it off.\"Don't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:75% of Warren Buffett's equity portfolio is in just 5 stocks.

        "article_content": "Getty ImagesExchange-traded funds came in third among the top 10 investment products to grow in popularity with U.S. households from 2020 to 2022, according to a new survey.While individual stocks were the most commonly owned investment product, held by 43% of households in 2022, 18% of households invested in ETFs in the same year, up by 2 percentage points from 2020, research firm Hearts & Wallets found.Additionally, consumers are more aware of what investment products they own compared with a decade ago. To that point, of the 123 million households in the U.S. with assets of at least $100, 77% are aware of how their portfolios are allocated across product types, up from 55% in 2013, the survey found.More from Personal Finance:3 reasons exchange-traded funds went 'mainstream' Retirement is overrated, Gen Z saysHow shoppers can vet homeowners associations\"It makes me excited that more households are able to even answer this question, that shows they're way more engaged in their saving and investing,\" said Laura Varas, founder and chief executive officer of Hearts and Wallets.\u00a0As households become more involved in their investing strategies, here are a few ways you can diversify your portfolio, increase your savings and reap tax benefits, according to experts.Separately managed accounts grew the mostMeanwhile separately managed accounts and high-yield savings accounts beat out ETFs for spots No. 1 and No. 2, respectively, in the Hearts & Wallets survey of investment products that grew the most from 2020 to 2022.SMAs, which are a portfolio of securities that a professional manages on your behalf, took the lead because \"they solve three main problems for investors,\" said Varas: They help investors diversify their portfolios in an \"especially good way,\" they can be tax-optimized and are under a professional's oversight, whether that is a financial institution or a manager.\"SMAs can be effective\" for investors who don't want to pick their own stock investments and still gain a broad exposure, said certified financial planner Douglas A. Boneparth, founder and president of Bone Fide Wealth in New York.\u00a0There's almost any kind of ETF you could imagine.Douglas Boneparthpresident of Bone Fide WealthWhile it will be important for investors to know how much they're paying the professional manager and the costs of the underlying investments, \"[I'm] not shocked to see that there's an increase in allocation or demand for that,\" added Boneparth.Meanwhile, high-yield savings accounts speak to the story around inflation and the Federal Reserve increasing rates, which \"have been the main headline the last year or so,\" he said.As this type of savings account benefits from high-rate conditions, investors can get more for their cash. These FDIC-insured accounts are also liquid, which can benefit investors who want to start an emergency fund.\"If you're not getting 5% [interest] on your savings, you're leaving money on the table,\" added Boneparth, a member of CNBC's FA Council.Why ETFs are becoming 'extremely popular'While ETFs do not benefit from high rates, \"they are becoming extremely popular investments for investors,\" said certified financial planner Blair duQuesnay, investment advisor at Ritholtz Wealth Management.They offer a level of diversification investors can't get by owning individual stocks, like \"being able to access the entire S&P500, every stock in it, for the price of one share of an ETF,\" and they are more tax-efficient than mutual funds, said duQuesnay, also on the CNBC FA Council.ETFs also trade during market hours, as opposed to the end of the day like mutual funds do and can be held in brokerage platforms.\"There's almost any kind of ETF you could imagine,\" said Boneparth.The original ETFs tracked major market indexes, but once the mechanism became popular, you can create an ETF with any investment thesis in mind, said duQuesnay.\"The most recent phenomenon are what we call thematic [ETFs],\" she said, \"if these themes catch on in the news, that investors maybe are searching for that theme, and they find their way easily to an ETF, which can raise a lot of money.\"Finding your best investment product fitInvestors should weigh potential investment product picks depending on the problems they're looking to solve, said Varas at Hearts & Wallets.High-yield savings accounts protect your principal with minimal risk. For the first time in a long time, cash is up for consideration in an investment portfolio as investors can earn 5% on cash savings, added duQuesnay.These are ideal if you want to benefit from high interest and are seeking liquidity, said Boneparth.If, on the other hand, you're looking for a way to invest your money and not have to choose your investments, a separately managed account outsources that decision-making process to a manager based on whatever the objective is, he added.In the end, however, if investors want to take a relatively small amount of money and access a very large basket of securities in a very tax efficient way, ETFs would be good to consider, duQuesnay said.Don't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:75% of Warren Buffett's equity portfolio is in just 5 stocks.

The U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates aggressively in response, which clobbered stocks and bonds.Bonds have historically served as a shock absorber in a 60/40 portfolio when stocks tank. But that defense mechanism broke down.How to rethink the 60/40That dynamic \u2014 stocks and bonds moving more in tandem \u2014 is likely to persist for a while, Paula Campbell Roberts, chief investment strategist for global wealth solutions at KKR, said at the summit.Indeed, while the Fed is unlikely to raise interest rates much higher (if at all), officials have also signaled they're unlikely to cut rates anytime soon.And there are some risks for U.S. stocks going forward, experts said. For one, while the S&P 500 is up 14% this year, those earnings are concentrated in just 10 of the biggest stocks, Roberts said.That said, investors also benefit from higher interest rates since they can \"access safer asset classes at a higher yield,\" Kroft said. For example, banks are paying 5% to 5.5% on high yield cash accounts, and municipal bonds pay a tax-equivalent yield of about 7%, she said.watch nowVIDEO4:2004:20Fed will start to pivot on rates in the second or third quarter of '24, says Charles Schwab's JonesSquawk on the StreetThe Fed's \"higher for longer\" mentality means bonds should have these equity-like returns for a longer period, Kroft said.So, what does this mean for the 60/40 portfolio? For one, it doesn't mean investors should dump their stocks, Kroft said.\"You never want to exit the asset class,\" she said.However, investors may consider substituting part \u2014 perhaps 10 percentage points \u2014 of their 60% stock allocation for so-called alternative investments, Kroft said.That would likely increase investment returns and, given the typical properties of \"alts,\" reduce the risk of those assets moving in tandem with stocks, Kroft said.Within the alts category, high net-worth investors can access certain things like private equity and private credit, Kroft said. The typical investor can gain alts access through more liquid funds \u2014 like a mutual fund or an exchange-traded fund \u2014 that focuses on alts, or via funds geared toward commodities, she added.She cautioned that affluent investors pursuing private equity need to be \"very careful\" in their selection of asset managers because the difference in performance between top-performing and mid-tier firms is \"huge,\" Kroft said.Within bonds, investors holding bonds with a short duration may want to consider extending that duration to lock in higher yields for longer, she added."

These benefit adjustments are made annually to help benefits keep place with inflation.How much retirees can expectThe change will result in an estimated Social Security retirement benefit increase of $50 per month, on average. The average monthly retirement benefit for workers will be $1,907, up from $1,848 this year, according to the Social Security Administration.Most Social Security beneficiaries will see the increase in their monthly checks starting in January. SSI beneficiaries will see the increase in their December checks.Just how much of an increase retired beneficiaries will see in their Social Security checks will also depend on the size of the Medicare Part B premium for 2024, which has not yet been announced.Typically, Medicare Part B premium payments are deducted from Social Security checks. The Medicare trustees have projected the average monthly premium may be $174.80 in 2024, up from $164.90 in 2023.How the 2024 COLA comparesThe 2024 benefit increase is much lower than record 8.7% cost-of-living adjustment Social Security beneficiaries saw this year, the biggest boost in four decades in response to record high inflation. It is also lower than the 5.9% cost-of-living adjustment for 2022.\u00a0The average cost-of-living adjustment has been 2.6% over the past 20 years, according to The Senior Citizens League, a nonpartisan senior group.The 3.2% increase is in line with an estimate released by The Senior Citizens League last month.The Social Security cost-of-living adjustment is calculated based on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, or CPI-W. Data from the third quarter is added and averaged and then compared with the third quarter average from the previous year.

The program is facing a funding shortfall in the next decade. Certain proposals to fix the program have also included a change the way the annual cost-of-living is calculated.The Consumer Price Index for the Elderly, or CPI-E, may be a better measure for the costs seniors face and help them maintain their purchasing power, advocates for the change argue. However, that measurement may not necessarily provide a bigger annual boost, research has found.\"We're happy to see an increase,\" Tracey Gronniger, managing director of economic security and housing at Justice in Aging, a national organization focused on fighting senior poverty, said of the COLA for 2024.However, the increase may not be sufficient, particularly for seniors who are living in poverty, she said.\"It's not enough in the sense that people are still trying to make ends meet, and they're still kind of struggling to meet their costs for housing and for health care,\" Gronniger said.Risks of higher Social Security benefitsHigher Social Security benefits due to cost-of-living adjustments in recent years have put low-income beneficiaries at risk for losing access to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, or rental assistance, according to The Senior Citizens League.Others may have seen their Social Security benefit income become subject to taxes for the first time, or may have seen the levies on that income go up. Up to 85% of benefits may be taxed based on certain income thresholds that are not adjusted for inflation.\"Social Security really only replaces about 30% or less of your earnings before you retired, and it's not ever been designed to be extremely generous,\" said Mary Johnson, Social Security and Medicare policy analyst at The Senior Citizens League.\"It's relatively modest in terms of income,\" she said."

        "article_content": "Gasoline was priced from $4.29 a gallon at a fuel station in Virginia on Aug. 16, 2023.Anadolu Agency | Anadolu Agency | Getty ImagesInflation rose in August on the back of higher gasoline prices, according to the consumer price index.But there's good news for Americans: That increase is likely temporary, economists said. Aside from energy, there are signs that inflation continued its broad retreat in August, they said.\"This should just be a temporary interruption of the downward trend,\" said Andrew Hunter, deputy chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics.\"Broadly, we're already seeing pretty clear signs the situation is approaching normal again,\" he added.Inflation measures how quickly prices are rising across the U.S. economy.In August, the CPI increased 3.7% from 12 months earlier, up from 3.2% in July, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said Wednesday.The rate has fallen from a pandemic-era peak of 9.1% in June 2022, the highest since 1981.The CPI is a key barometer of inflation, measuring prices of anything from fruits and vegetables to haircuts and concert tickets.How gas prices contributed to higher inflationGasoline prices jumped 10.6% in August, following a 0.2% increase in July, according to Wednesday's CPI report. The BLS adjusts those numbers for seasonal trends.Gasoline cost $3.84 a gallon, on average, as of Tuesday, according to AAA.Gasoline was the largest contributor to inflation in August, accounting for more than half of the increase, according to the BLS.The increase is largely attributable to dynamics in the market for crude oil, which is refined into gasoline, Hunter said. On Tuesday, oil prices hit their highest levels since November.More from Your Money:Here's a look at more stories on how to manage, grow and protect your money for the years ahead.With a good credit score, \u2018doors will open.\u2019 But many face a roadblock100-year-old still has $1 million saved: \u2018I always lived within my means'Middle-class Americans want to know how the wealthy make moneyTransportation costs \u2014 including gasoline \u2014 are the second-largest expense, after housing, for the average household, according to the U.S. Department of Labor's consumer expenditures survey.While rising gasoline prices may be challenging for consumers from a budgetary perspective, it's unlikely they'll be sustained beyond another month or two, Hunter said.While gasoline prices have risen in the short term, they've declined 3.3% from a year ago.'Core' inflation showed a 'bump in the road'When assessing underlying inflation trends, economists generally like to look at one measure that strips out energy and food prices, which tend to be volatile from month to month. This pared-down measure \u2014 known as \"core\" CPI \u2014 fell to an annual rate of 4.3% in August from 4.7% in July.On a monthly basis, core inflation rose slightly, to 0.3% in August from 0.2% in July. The economy would need consistent monthly core CPI readings of 0.2% to get the U.S. back to its pre-pandemic baseline, a time when inflation was low and stable, economists said.The increase in monthly core CPI \"is a little bump in the road,\" said Kayla Bruun, senior economist at Morning Consult.\"It doesn't mean it's turning around and going in the other direction,\" Bruun said. \"Overall, most of the pieces are headed in the right direction.\"watch nowVIDEO3:4003:40The overall trend does show us that inflation remains moderate, says American Progress' Emily GeeSquawk BoxHousing was the largest contributor to the rise in core CPI in August, according to the BLS.However, rent inflation is poised to keep falling, economists said. That's because new monthly rent prices have \"slowed very sharply\" in the U.S. over the past year or so, but such trends generally feed through to the CPI data with a lag, Hunter said.Other \"notable\" contributors to inflation over the past year include motor vehicle insurance, with prices up 19.1% from August 2022; recreation, up 3.5%; personal care, up 5.8%; and new vehicles, up 2.9%, the BLS said.Conversely, easing price pressures for groceries \u2014 a \"staple household expense\" \u2014 has been a \"bright spot\" for consumers, said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.Inflation is multipronged and globalInflation during the pandemic era has been a \"complicated phenomenon\" stemming from \"multiple sources and complex dynamic interactions,\" according to a paper published in May that was co-authored by Ben Bernanke, former chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve, and Olivier Blanchard, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.At a high level, inflationary pressures \u2014 which have been felt globally \u2014 are due to an imbalance between supply and demand.The pandemic snarled global supply chains and led prices to surge as the U.S. economy reopened. Basically, consumers unleashed pent-up demand while there was still a shortage of goods.Scott Olson | Getty ImagesRussia's invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 exacerbated backlogs in the global supply chain and fueled higher prices for food, energy and other commodities.Also, a hot labor market led employers to raise wages at the fastest pace in decades, feeding through to inflation, particularly in labor-intensive service industries.Those trends have largely unwound, Hunter said. Wage growth is still \"quite high\" but coming down and the broad labor market is easing, he said.\"We've definitely come a long way in terms of getting back to normal,\" he said. \"We're not all the way there yet.\""

Fees for restaurant employee health insurance, credit card transactions\u00a0and even tap water make diners want to leave less on the total tab, Plam said. \"They don't need to tip as much if they're covering health care,\" he said. \"That's the quick calculation.\"These days, fewer consumers also said they \"always\" tip when dining out compared to last year, according to Bankrate, or for other services, such as ride-hailing services, haircuts, food delivery, housekeeping and home repairs.Brand New Images | Getty ImagesYet, since transactions are\u00a0increasingly cashless, having a method to tip workers in the service industry earning minimum wage or less than minimum wage is critical, Plam added.Under federal law, employers can pay workers\u00a0as little as $2.13 per hour\u00a0\u2014 much less than the minimum wage \u2014 if the tips they receive bring them up to a baseline salary. Some states are now increasing the hourly minimum wage for\u00a0tipped employees\u00a0or have eliminated tipping wages altogether.For restaurant workers, tips can boost wages about 90%, according to data provided to CNBC from payroll platform Gusto.Still, tips are down slightly from a year ago, Gusto also found.\"What we are seeing is a settling at a lower level in the wake of the post-pandemic surge,\" said Luke\u00a0Pardue, an economist at\u00a0Gusto.\u00a0Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube."

The group based its calculations on an hourly rate of $14.55 an hour, the midpoint between mean wages of child care workers and personal care aides.On a broader level, unpaid caregiving is worth $305.01 billion a year for men and $626.57 billion for women, the National Partnership for Women and Families estimates.In other words, the caregiving time gap costs women an extra $321.56 billion a year.'Caregiving has been a problem for a long time'The National Partnership for Women and Families is not the only organization to flag the financial and time burdens of caregiving.About 38 million people provided unpaid care to an adult family member or friend in 2021, according to the latest data from AARP. It estimates the economic value of unpaid care was $600 billion, based on a total of 36 billion hours of care at an average value of $16.59 an hour, AARP found.\"Caregiving has been a problem for a long time, as far as how much of it is unpaid, and also that the majority of it does fall on women,\" said certified financial planner Carolyn McClanahan, founder of\u00a0Life Planning Partners\u00a0in Jacksonville, Florida.watch nowVIDEO1:1501:15Invest like a woman - the non-profit that wants to bridge the gender gap on Wall StreetWomen and WealthTo that point, 61% of caregivers are women, while 39% are men, according to a 2020 AARP study.A lot of women are part of the \"sandwich generation,\" who are still taking care of young children when their aging parents start having needs, said McClanahan, who is also a member of the CNBC Financial Advisor Council.This is observed among adults between ages 35 and 44, when the most intensive period of caregiving for both men and women occurs, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics has found.\"That age band is the peak caregiving period for both men and women, though the gap is still very large between men and women,\" said Gallagher Robbins.Caregivers may have resources available to relieve some of the burden and provide care for those in need.For instance, family caregivers may be able to be paid by Medicaid, depending on their state of residence.

These tax rates (which also apply to income like job wages) are up to 37%.How cash in an old piano established taxationThe taxation of found property has its roots in a court case from the 1960s, according to TurboTax.A married couple \u2014 Ermenegildo and Mary Cesarini \u2014 bought a used piano in 1957. Seven years later, when cleaning the instrument, they found $4,467 of old currency inside. The couple, who exchanged the currency for new notes at a bank, paid $836 of income tax on the find but later requested a tax refund, claiming it wasn't taxable income. A federal judge rejected the premise, siding with the IRS in federal court.Valuable discoveries happen more often than you might think.watch nowVIDEO10:5610:56How the U.S. wastes tax moneyMarkets and Politics Digital Original VideoFor example, in June, a man found more than 700 Civil War-era gold coins in a Kentucky cornfield, a treasure that may reportedly be worth more than $1 million. In April, after a meteorite landed near the U.S.-Canada border, a museum in Maine offered $25,000 to anyone who found a piece of the rock weighing at least 1 kilogram. In 2020, a Michigan man found $43,000 stuffed in a donated couch.The same tax concept also applies to sports memorabilia \u2014 say, catching Derek Jeter's 3,000-hit ball or Tom Brady's 600th touchdown pass \u2014 or winning a car on a game show.Legal ownership starts the clockThere are some caveats. For one, there may be questions of legal ownership: Does the discovery truly belong to you?\"When you have a legal right to the property you find, that becomes Tax Day,\" said Lewis, who also owns an accounting firm in Draper, Utah.This could become a challenge for taxpayers who don't have the money on hand to pay perhaps hundreds or thousands of dollars in income tax, Lewis said.The date of legal acquisition also starts the clock relative to one's holding period and cost basis (i.e., value), he added.These become important if the finder later sells the object. That's because tax code offers preferential tax rates on profits from investments and other property like collectibles that are held for more than a year. (In such a case, taxes on \"long-term\" capital gains would kick in.) If held for a year or less, those preferential capital gains tax rates disappear.Many found items, like gold coins and meteorites, would likely be considered collectibles, Lewis said. Federal long-term capital gains taxes on collectibles can go as high as 28%, while those on other assets like stocks and real estate can reach 20%."

And the results may also affect your spouse or dependents.But sifting through Social Security's claiming rules may make it difficult to precisely identify the best strategy for you.More from Life Changes:Here's a look at other stories offering a financial angle on important lifetime milestones.\u2018Retirement spending is not pass-fail,\u2019 advisor says. How to reframe your strategyWith or without loan forgiveness, fewer students are enrolling in college3 financial tips for couples moving in together for the first timeMoreover, negative headlines about the program \u2014 particularly regarding a depletion date for Social Security's retirement fund that's coming up in the next decade \u2014 may sway your claiming decision.As beneficiaries try to make sense of their options, experts say certain misconceptions tend to prevail.Here's some of the biggest myths experts say they see \u2014 and the truths behind them.Myth 1: Claiming early is bestNegative headlines may scare people into claiming as early as possible to get the most benefits.Eligibility for Social Security retirement benefits starts at age 62. But by claiming early, you will receive less than your full retirement benefit.To get your full retirement benefit, you must wait until what is called your \"full retirement age.\" This depends on your birth year.Those born in 1960 or later have a full retirement age of 67. People in that age cohort who start benefits at age 62 will receive just 70% of their earned benefits.watch nowVIDEO1:2101:21How to choose the right retirement investments for 2022Closing BellThat gradually increases to 100% at full retirement age. If they wait even longer, they will receive an 8% benefit boost per year up to age 70.Most people know it pays to wait to claim, a recent Schroders survey found. But just 10% of claimants start benefits at age 70.The top reason survey respondents said they plan to claim between ages 62 and 65: the fear that Social Security may run out of money and stop making payments.Experts say you're only hurting yourself if you claim early due to fears the program may run dry after the Social Security trust funds reach their depletion dates.Every time we have approached a shortfall in the past, there has been some compromise to be able to continue benefits.Joe Elsasserpresident of Covisum\"Every time we have approached a shortfall in the past, there has been some compromise to be able to continue benefits,\" said Joe Elsasser, a certified financial planner and founder and president of Covisum, a Social Security claiming software company.Even if no changes are made, the average retiree will still receive around 77 cents on the dollar, Elsasser said.Prospective legislative actions will likely mean changes \u2014 such as a higher retirement age or increased Social Security payroll taxes or higher taxes on benefits, predicts Laurence Kotlikoff, a Boston University economics professor and creator of Maximize My Social Security, a claiming software tool.Nevertheless, it still pays to wait, Kotlikoff's research has found. Claiming before age 70 results in an estimated median household loss of about $182,000 in lifetime discretionary spending for claimants ages 45 to 62.Myth 2: My 'break even' age tells me when to claimSome claimants prefer to use a calculation called their \"break even\" age to decide when to start benefits. The break-even age is the point when the value of benefits if you wait to take Social Security later surpasses the value of taking them early.But by focusing on that measure, you may not consider other important factors, such as how your spouse or dependents may also get the most benefits, according to Bruce Tannahill, a director of estate and business planning at MassMutual.Kotlikoff's Social Security claiming software includes the break-even age because of the demand for it, he said. At the same time, there's also a warning not to consider it.If your break-even age is after your life expectancy, that may tempt you to claim early.But life expectancy is an imprecise date because no one dies on time, Kotlikoff said. The risk is that you will live longer and not have enough income to support you.\"The decision to wait is really buying longevity insurance from Social Security,\" Kotlikoff said.Myth 3: Claiming now will give me a cost-of-living adjustmentEvery year, Social Security adjusts benefits for inflation in what's known as a cost-of-living adjustment.Due to surging prices, that increase is a record 8.7% in 2023, the highest bump in four decades. As inflation subsides, the cost-of-living adjustment for 2024 is projected to be much lower \u2013 around 3%.That may tempt eligible retirement beneficiaries to claim this year to benefit from the increase.Experts say that's not the best idea.\"You don't have to start now to get the benefit of a cost-of-living adjustment,\" Tannahill said.\"Social Security will adjust your projected benefits to reflect the cost-of-living adjustments that occur prior to the time that you retire,\" he said.Myth 4: Social Security benefits are not taxedThanasis | Moment | Getty ImagesThe misperception that Social Security benefits aren't taxed is \"perhaps the biggest myth of all,\" said Mary Johnson, Social Security and Medicare policy analyst at The Senior Citizens League.Social Security benefits are taxed based on a formula called \"combined\" or \"provisional\" income. That includes the sum of your adjusted gross income, nontaxable interest and half of your Social Security benefits.If that sum is less than $25,000 if you file your federal tax return individually, or less than $32,000 if you're married and filing jointly, your benefits will not be taxed.But up to 50% of benefits are taxable for individuals with combined incomes between $25,000 and $34,000, or married couples with between $32,000 and $44,000.Meanwhile, up to 85% of benefits are taxed for those with combined incomes that are more than $34,000 if they file individually, or more than $44,000 if married and filing jointly.Because those income levels are not adjusted for inflation, more people are subject to what some experts call a \"stealth tax\" on benefits.One way to adjust for those levies is to withhold federal income taxes from your benefits. Experts also recommend prioritizing your income streams with those taxes in mind.Myth 5: I can make the best claiming decisionAnna Frank | E+ | Getty ImagesWhen deciding when to claim Social Security, it may be tempting to follow what a friend, family member or neighbor did. You may also be inclined to go to your local Social Security office for help.But none of those sources may lead you to the best answer for you.\"They will help you get the maximum benefits you're entitled to at that time,\" Tannahill said of Social Security offices.But they may not give you tips on how to get larger benefits, say by waiting until your full retirement age or by taking survivor benefits first to allow your retirement benefits to grow.\"If any effort goes into Social Security, it should just go into understanding the rules and how they interact with your personal circumstances,\" Elsasser said.The Social Security website is a great place to start to get educated on the rules of the program, Tannahill said.But to get personalized advice, you need to find the right financial advisor who is well versed on Social Security's rules. Those professionals often use software to identify the best claiming decisions.Consumer-facing tools, such as one offered by Kotlikoff's company, may help you evaluate your choices on your own."

Roughly 15,950 retirement savers withdrew money from a 401(k) plan to cover a financial hardship in the second quarter, up 36% year over year.Vanguard's report found that 401(k) hardship withdrawals hit a record high last year.

These are people who have had a significant and immediate financial situation,\" Shamrell said.And in some cases, especially for cash-strapped consumers living paycheck to paycheck, it may even make sense to cover the cost of an emergency all at once, rather than tap a loan that then gets deducted from your take-home pay, he added."

The withholding applies to winnings of more than $5,000.If you choose the $378.8 million cash option, the 24% withholding automatically reduces your cut by about $90.9 million.

For 2023, the 37% rate applies to taxable income of $578,126 or more for single filers and $693,751 or higher for married couples filing together. You calculate taxable income by subtracting the greater of the standard or itemized deductions from your adjusted gross income.Of course, the 37% doesn't apply to all of your taxable income. For 2023, single filers will pay $174,238.25, plus 37% of the amount over $578,125. As for married couples filing together, the total owed is $186,601.50, plus 37% of the amount above $693,750.The remaining tax bill depends on several factors but could easily represent millions more.You may also owe state taxes, depending on where you live and where you bought the ticket. While some states have no income tax or don't tax lottery winnings, others have top-income state tax brackets exceeding 10%.\u00a0The Powerball isn't the only chance to win big. The jackpot for Friday night's Mega Millions drawing now stands at an estimated $560 million. The chance of hitting the jackpot in that game is roughly 1 in 302 million."

But if your tax bracket is lower, paying levies now with Roth deposits may make sense.If you're in the 22% or 24% bracket or lower, I think the Roth contribution makes sense, assuming you'll be in a higher bracket upon retirement.Lawrence PonCPA at Pon & AssociatesRoth 401(k) contributions are typically good for younger workers who expect to earn more later in their careers, explained Lawrence Pon, a CFP and certified public accountant at Pon & Associates in Redwood City, California.\"If you're in the 22% or 24% bracket or lower, I think the Roth contribution makes sense, assuming you'll be in a higher bracket upon retirement,\" he said.\u00a0There's a 'low-tax sweet spot' through 2025Although it's unclear how Congress may change tax policy, several provisions from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 are scheduled to sunset in 2026, including lower tax brackets and a higher standard deduction.Experts say these expected changes may also factor into the pretax versus Roth contributions analysis.\"We're in this low-tax sweet spot,\" said Catherine Valega, a CFP and founder of Green Bee Advisory in Boston, referring to the period before tax brackets may get higher. \"I say taxes are on sale.\"\u00a0We're in this low-tax sweet spot.Catherine ValegaFounder of Green Bee AdvisoryWhile Roth contributions are a \"no-brainer\" for young, lower earners, she said the current tax environment has made these deposits more attractive for higher-income clients, as well.\u00a0\"I have clients who can get in $22,500 for three years,\" Valega said. \"That's a pretty nice chunk of change that will grow tax-free.\"Plus, recent changes from Secure 2.0 have made Roth 401(k) contributions more appealing for some investors, she said.\u00a0Plans may now offer Roth employer matches and Roth 401(k)s no longer have required minimum distributions. Of course, plans may vary based on which features employers choose to adopt.Consider your 'legacy goals'\"Legacy goals\" are also a factor when deciding between pretax and Roth contributions, said Lawrence from Mariner Wealth Advisors.\"Estate planning is becoming a larger piece of what people are actually thinking about,\" he said.Since the Secure Act of 2019, tax planning has become trickier for inherited individual retirement accounts.

But the right amount of cash depends on your household and occupation, according to financial experts.Most Americans aren't prepared for a financial emergency, according to a recent CNBC/Momentive survey of more than 4,000 U.S. adults. More than half of Americans don't have an emergency fund, and 40% of those who do have less than $10,000, the findings show.While experts often suggest keeping enough cash to cover three to six months' worth of living expenses, others have a more nuanced approach.More from FA Playbook:Here's a look at other stories impacting the financial advisor business.3 risky financial areas to watch as possible recession loomsPicking the most tax-efficient ways to give to charityActively managed ETFs may help during market volatility\"Rules of thumb overlook a number of important factors,\" said certified financial planner Andy Baxley at The Planning Center in Chicago.\"The volatility of the sector you work in, the stability and predictability of your income streams, and whether or not you are self-employed are just a few examples,\" he said.Consider your job securitySufficient emergency savings depends on how long it may take to replace your current income after a job loss, according to Niv Persaud, a CFP and managing director at Transition Planning & Guidance in Atlanta.Despite threats of a recession, the labor market has remained strong with the unemployment rate at 3.4% in April, tied for the lowest level since 1969. While sectors like tech, financial companies, health care and retail have been hit with layoffs in 2023, that doesn't mean workers are scrambling for jobs.Some 55% of workers who were laid off in December or January found new jobs by the end of January, according to a ZipRecruiter survey. On average, it took workers seven weeks to find a new job, with employees in advertising and marketing, the automotive industry, and technology most likely to already have found a new position.watch nowVIDEO3:2403:24Pres. Biden expects debt ceiling talks to resume on TuesdaySquawk BoxStill, \"the job search process is longer for higher-income individuals,\" said Persaud, who urges clients to keep nine months of emergency reserves \u2014 including rent or mortgage, utilities, food and other necessary costs \u2014 for dual-income households and one year of expenses for single-income families.Kevin Brady, a CFP and vice president at Wealthspire Advisors in New York, also considers his clients' job security, aiming for three months of expenses for a two-income household with secure jobs, or six months of expenses for a one-income family with a secure job. However, a one-income household with \"highly variable pay\" may aim for nine months of emergency savings, he said.Add a buffer for highly correlated incomeDual earners may also consider the degree of correlation between each partner's income. \"If you both work in tech sales, the likelihood of you both losing your jobs at the same time is higher than if, say, one of you were a professor,\" Baxley said. When income is highly correlated, he typically recommends a larger emergency fund.Of course, the right number may also hinge on personal preference. \"If some calculator says you should have $20,000 in emergency reserves but you won't sleep at night with anything under $40,000, then $40,000 is probably the right number.\""

IRS tools will help taxpayers identify their mistakes before filing returns, and upgrades may help resolve filers' errors more quickly.\"That's a departure from the organization's traditions,\" said Mark Everson, a former IRS commissioner and current vice chairman at Alliantgroup. \"It's also a recognition of how badly things got out of whack during the pandemic.\"Further, the agency aims to eliminate its paper backlog within five years by moving to a \"fully digital correspondence process,\" Deputy Treasury\u00a0Secretary\u00a0Wally\u00a0Adeyemo said during the call.IRS to focus on 'wealthy individuals'The agency's plan also aims to reduce the budget deficit by closing the tax gap, with an initial focus on tax returns for wealthy families, large corporations and complex partnerships, Werfel said.Boosting the experienced staff needed for more complicated audits will take time, Everson said.\"The IRS has no plans to increase the most current audit rate we have for households making less than $400,000,\" he said, noting the audit rate for filers below these thresholds \"won't come close\" to reaching or exceeding historic averages.watch nowVIDEO10:4210:42How the IRS worksMarkets and Politics Digital Original VideoQuestions remain about higher audit rates among Black Americans, which Werfel committed to investigating during his confirmation hearing.\"That strikes me as a much more challenging question to resolve than the $400,000 threshold,\" said Janet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, noting there are several unanswered questions for the IRS to explore.The earned income tax credit, a tax break targeted at low- to moderate-income filers, is a contributing factor to the higher audit rate among Black Americans, research shows."

        "article_content": "Izusek | E+ | Getty ImagesEmotions can get the better of us when it comes to investing \u2014 particularly when financial markets get volatile.Behavioral finance tells us we are inherently bad investors, prone to making decisions based on emotions rather than evidence and self-interest. Just as we are a bundle of biases and fears in our personal lives, we are in our investing lives, as well. We are afraid of losses, afraid of missing out on gains; we have biases toward consensus opinion and to recent experience.\"People are always emotional,\" said Tim Maurer, chief advisory officer for SignatureFD, which has offices in Atlanta and in Charlotte, North Carolina.\"We may think we're making rational decisions, but we're usually not,\" said Maurer, a certified financial planner who is also a member of the CNBC Financial Advisor Council. \"They are more likely driven by emotions, and then we rationalize them.\"More from Advice and the Advisor:What happens if you don't disclose crypto activity to IRSWhy asset allocation matters when it comes to taxes3 key reasons to keep your will and estate plan updatedMaurer, however, does not dismiss investors' emotional responses outright as behavior to be suppressed.\"The notion that these are faulty emotions and that we are responding inappropriately is false,\" he said. \"We need to acknowledge that these emotions and fears exist and that they're not necessarily bad or good; they are neutral.\"They do, however, need to be controlled. Emotions are not a sound basis for an investing strategy. Evidence continues to show that active investors underperform the market in the long run.By the time most people react to events in the market, the market has already priced in the risk. Trying to time the ups and downs of financial asset prices rarely works to investors' advantage.If you've got a plan in place, sit tightBut what if you're worried about a banking crisis? Or a still hawkish Federal Reserve or a possible recession on the horizon?Like all good advisors, Maurer recommends that you hold tight. If investors follow a well-thought-out plan that balances their short- and long-term financial needs with their tolerance for risk, they'll be fine in the long run.\"The whole notion of a balanced portfolio is designed to accommodate our emotions and fears,\" Maurer said. \"Otherwise, we should always invest in small value stocks which over the long run outperform everything else.\"Bond investments are an [emotional] accommodation,\" he added. \"We own them so we can stay invested in stocks when times are tough.\"watch nowVIDEO3:4903:49CNBC FA Council members share their strategies for a volatile marketAsk an AdvisorBias is an inclination of temperament or outlook, a personal and sometimes unreasoned judgment, according to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary. It is generally considered a negative trait and something to ideally overcome. In an investing context, however, biases are not always bad.\"Our biases are there for a reason,\" Maurer said. \"When it feels like the market is at a top, it's not unnatural to think about changing your investment strategy.\"\"It might not be optimal, but it's not unnatural.\"I'm a proponent of proactive management of allocations if someone's tolerance for risk has truly changed, but not if they just think banking stocks are overvalued.Tim Maurerchief advisory officer for SignatureFDSome behavioral biases protect us.While most Americans have a bias for a dollar today vs. a dollar in the future, the reverse can also have bad consequences.\"There are people who fund their future but don't fund their present in the form of emergency cash,\" Maurer said. \"Then a job loss or a family emergency forces them to access retirement funds at an inopportune time.\"\"In other words, our bias for the present makes sense in that regard,\" he said.Taking care of the present is particularly important for people in or near retirement.\"When people know they have enough cash to support themselves for seven to 12 years, they sleep better at night,\" he said. \"They are more likely to look through stock market volatility and do a better job investing for their future.\"Maurer has been a financial advisor for 25 years. He is a believer in diversified investment portfolios and sticking to a financial plan. However, if market volatility is a source of high anxiety for someone, he's not against making changes to a portfolio.\"I'm a proponent of proactive management of allocations if someone's tolerance for risk has truly changed, but not if they just think banking stocks are overvalued,\" he said. \"When there's a risk that someone abandons a 60/40 [stock/bond] allocation for all cash, they may find solace in taking some action short of that extreme.\"We are inherently emotional beings, and few things elicit more emotion than when we believe our investments are at risk. Acknowledge these emotions; don't deny them. It will give you more control over them and improve your financial decision-making, Maurer said.Face those fears sooner rather than later.\"I have a bias towards proactivity, not reactivity,\" he said. \"People need to accommodate their emotions in advance rather than them causing you to make snap decisions in difficult times.\""

        "article_content": "(Bloomberg) -- The Labour Party needs to find at least \u00a38 billion ($10 billion) to deliver its green-investment plan, a new analysis shows, underscoring why UK opposition leader Keir Starmer may be mulling changes to the initiative.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nUS Fires on Houthi Missile Hours After Trafigura Ship Attack\nGiuliani Lists Yankees Loot, Trump Claim as Assets in Bankruptcy\nMacKenzie Scott Pares Her Amazon Stake by $10 Billion\nSingapore\u2019s $200,000 Toyotas Fuel Angst Over Widening Wealth Gap\nGas-Addicted Europe Trades One Energy Risk for Another\nThe party\u2019s original \u201c\u00a328 billion a year\u201d pledge to invest in industries that advance Britain\u2019s transition to a greener economy if it wins power this year isn\u2019t quite as big as it sounds, according the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The government\u2019s own plans cover some of the cost and Labour\u2019s decision to ramp up spending gradually brings it closer to meeting the party\u2019s fiscal rules.\nHowever, Labour would still need to raise taxes or cut spending to cover the difference, something the party has been reluctant to do with public services crumbling and the tax burden already at a post-war high. In recent days, the party has mulled whether to drop the headline \u00a328 billion number altogether and replace it with a non-specific commitment to spend whatever the fiscal rules allow, according to people familiar with the discussions.\nLabour officials declined to comment on the proposal. Starmer reaffirmed the green plan in an interview with the BBC earlier this month, although he added caveats, saying it was \u201csubject to what the government has already assigned\u201d for environmental projects and needed to be \u201cwithin our fiscal rules.\u201d\nThe green spending pledge is both Starmer\u2019s most concrete policy goal and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak most frequent target in his campaign to paint the Labour leader as planning a tax-and-spend agenda. Last week, Sunak said told broadcasters Starmer \u201ccan\u2019t say how he would fund his \u00a328 billion green spending spree, which just means higher taxes.\u201d\nThe Conservatives can complicate things for Labour by spending more of the \u00a313 billion fiscal buffer left over after Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt\u2019s autumn fiscal statement in November. Hunt is expected to use half in his March budget to scrap a planned increase in fuel duty and whatever is left over to cut personal taxes.\nThe Conservative premier is attempting to chip away at Labour\u2019s double-digit lead in public opinion polls ahead of a general election the prime minister has said he will call in the second half of the year. Labour is seeking to finalize its manifesto promises in the coming weeks in case the election comes earlier.\nTo neutralize the Tory attacks, Starmer and his would-be chancellor, Rachel Reeves, have drawn up fiscal rules that constrain them as much the current rules constrain the government. However, despite the big headline price of the green commitment, Labour is close to being able to afford it, according to Ben Zaranko, senior research economist at the IFS.\nStarmer\u2019s decision in October to include carbon-emission reductions already planned by the Conservatives lowered the cost of the package by almost one-third to \u00a320 billion. Labour now plans to ramp up its spending gradually over the forecast, rather than spend the full amount from the start.\nInflation has also eroded 20% of the real cost since the pledge was first announced in 2021, Zaranko said. He calculated policy changes already made by Labour would leave only an \u00a38 billion shortfall against the fiscal rules. \u201cThe pledge is getting easier to meet,\u201d he said.\nHere are some options Labour has to fill the hole:\nMove Target Year: Labour plans to ramp up investment to 2030. The current forecasts end in 2029. When the target date was rolled forward a year in the Autumn Statement, the Office for Budget Responsibility gave the government leeway for additional spending of \u00a35 billion. Labour could assume a similar \u00a35 billion improvement in 2030 to help close the gap.\nReclassify Spending: Labour could repurpose more existing spending as green investment by adding solar panels to school roofs or incorporating the government\u2019s existing \u00a37,500 heat pump boiler upgrade program into its green plan.\nReplace \u2018Triple Lock\u2019: The triple lock guarantees the state pension rises by the greatest of inflation, earnings or 2.5%. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has suggested using an average of inflation and wage growth, which would save \u00a34 billion in 2030.\nClose Tax Loopholes: Reeves has so far favored \u201cclosing loopholes\u201d over broad tax increases. The Resolution Foundation has suggested charging national insurance on employer pension contributions, lowering the VAT registration threshold for business, and ending Business Asset Disposal relief. That would save \u00a310 billion.\nChange Debt Measure: Until 2021, the government used public sector net debt for its fiscal rule. Sunak, as chancellor, changed it to public sector net debt \u201cexcluding the Bank of England,\u201d which adjusts for quantitative easing. The new target is harder to hit. While Hunt hit PSND-ex BOE with \u00a313 billion to spare in November, he would\u2019ve been \u00a330 billion under the previous target. Reeves could revert to the old measure. However, she has said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to try to fiddle the figures or make something different to get better results. We will use the same models the government uses.\u201d\nGeorge Dibb, associate director at the Institute for Public Policy Research, said the deficit would be smaller if the OBR scored the investment as growth-enhancing. Adjusting for growth, the shortfall drops to just \u00a32 billion.\n\u201cIn the context of the public finances, the sums we are talking about are pretty small. All you need is a relatively small shift in bond yields, which would have an outsize effect on the headroom,\u201d Dibb said.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow a Lucky Break Fueled Eli Lilly\u2019s $600 Billion Weight-Loss Empire\nHow the West\u2019s Favorite Autocrat Engineered Africa\u2019s Most Dramatic Turnaround\nAI Needs So Much Power That Old Coal Plants Are Sticking Around\nWhy Did Car Insurance Get So Expensive?\nAmerican Workers Come Out Winners in a Clash Between Economists Over a Curve\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P."

        "article_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Car factories have idled in Belgium and Germany. Spring fashion lines are delayed at a popular British department store. A Maryland company that makes hospital supplies doesn\u2019t know when to expect parts from Asia.\nAttacks on ships in the Red Sea are delivering another shock to global trade, coming on top of pandemic-related logjams at ports and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nHouthi rebels in Yemen, seeking to stop Israel's offensive against Hamas in Gaza, are attacking cargo ships plying the waters connecting Asia with Europe and the United States, forcing traffic away from the Suez Canal and around the tip of Africa. The disruption is causing delays and driving up costs \u2014 at a time when the world has yet to vanquish a resurgence of inflation.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happened right now is short-term chaos, and chaos leads to increased costs,\" said Ryan Petersen, CEO of the supply chain management company Flexport. \u201cEvery ship that gets rerouted has 10,000 containers on it. It\u2019s a lot of emails and phone calls getting made to replan each of those container journeys.\"\nAdding to the bedlam in global shipping is what Petersen calls a \u201cdouble whammy\": Passage through another crucial trade corridor \u2014 the Panama Canal \u2014 is restricted by low water levels caused by drought. And shippers are in a rush to move goods before Chinese factories shut down for the Feb. 10-17 Lunar New Year holiday.\nThe threat grows considerably the longer the war in Gaza drags on. Disruption to Red Sea trade lasting a year could surge goods inflation by up to 2%, Petersen says, piling on pain while the world already struggles with higher prices for groceries, rent and more. That also could mean even higher interest rates, which have weakened economies.\nFor now, Man & Machine in Greater Landover, Maryland, is awaiting a shipment from Taiwan and greater China. It\u2019s been one setback after another for the company, which makes washable keyboards and accessories for hospitals and other customers.\nFounder and CEO Clifton Broumand usually gets a shipment of components about once a month, but the latest delivery, which departed Asia four weeks ago, is delayed. The normal route \u2014 three weeks via the Suez Canal \u2014 has been shut down by the Houthi attacks.\nRerouting to the Panama Canal didn\u2019t work either \u2014 the shipment was stymied there by the drought-related mess. Now, it might have to cross the Pacific to Los Angeles and come by truck or train to Maryland. Broumand has no idea when the products will arrive.\n\u201cIt\u2019s annoying, and it\u2019s interesting. I think our customers, everybody understands. This is not like, \u2018Why didn\u2019t you plan this?\u2019 \u2014 who knew?\u201d he said. \u201cWe call our customers and say, \u2018Hey, it\u2019s going to be delayed. This is why it is.\u2019 Nobody likes it, but it\u2019s not going to kill anybody, it\u2019s just another frustration.\u201d\nOther industries are seeing similar hassles.\nElectric carmaker Tesla has to shut down its factory near Berlin from Monday to Feb. 11 because of shipment delays. The Chinese-owned Swedish car brand Volvo idled its assembly line in Ghent, Belgium, where it makes station wagons and SUVs, for three days this month while waiting for a key part for transmissions.\nProduction at a Suzuki Motor Corp. plant in Hungary stopped for a week because of a delay in getting engines and other parts from Japan.\nThe British retail chain Marks & Spencer warned that the turmoil would delay new spring clothing and home goods collections that were due in February and March. Chief executive Stuart Machin said the Red Sea trouble was \u201cimpacting everyone and something we\u2019re very focused on.\"\nRoughly 20% of the clothes and shoes imported into the U.S. arrive via the Suez Canal, said Steve Lamar, CEO of the American Apparel & Footwear Association. For Europe, the impact is even bigger: 40% of clothes and 50% of shoes traverse the Red Sea.\n\u201cThis is a crisis that has global implications for the maritime shipping industry,\" Lamar said.\nAs of Jan. 19, Flexport says, almost 25% of global shipping capacity is being or will be diverted from the Red Sea, adding thousands of miles and a week or two to trips.\nThe cost of shipping a standard 40-foot container from Asia to northern Europe has surged from less than $1,500 in mid-December to nearly $5,500. Getting Asian cargoes to the Mediterranean is even costlier: almost $6,800, up from $2,400 in mid-December, according to the freight booking platform Freightos.\nBut things could be worse. At the height of supply chain backups two years ago, it cost $15,000 to ship a container from Asia to northern Europe and nearly $14,200 to take one from Asia to the Mediterranean.\n\u201cIn terms of supply chain disruptions, we\u2019re not even close to what was happening during the pandemic,\" said Katheryn Russ, a University of California, Davis, economist.\nIn 2021 and 2022, American consumers, stir-crazy from COVID-19 lockdowns and armed with government relief checks, went on a spending spree, ordering furniture, sports equipment and other goods. Their orders overwhelmed factories, ports and freight yards, leading to delays, shortages and higher prices.\nThings are different now. After that supply chain mess, shipping companies expanded their fleets. They have more ships to cope with shocks.\n\u201cThe market is in a state of overcapacity,\" said Judah Levine, Freightos\u2019 head of research, \u201cwhich happens to be a good thing. There should be enough capacity to accommodate this disruption.\"\nGlobal demand also has cooled off \u2014 partly because the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks have raised interest rates to combat inflation and partly because China\u2019s powerhouse economy is sputtering. Inflation has come down over the past year and a half, though it's still higher than central banks would like.\n\u201cThere are really big forces bringing down inflation,\" said Russ, who was a White House economic adviser in the Obama administration. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see (the Red Sea disruption) would substantially muck up the declines in inflation that we\u2019ve been seeing beyond a tenth of a percentage point here and there.\"\nMany companies say they have yet to see meaningful impact. Retailer Target, for instance, said most of its products don\u2019t pass through the Suez Canal and was \u201cconfident in our ability to get guests the products they want and need.\u201d\nBMW said: \u201cAll lights are green\u2026 our factory supplies are secure.\" Norwegian fertilizer giant Yara said it was \u201conly mildly impacted by the transit challenges in the Red Sea.\"\nCarlos Tavares, CEO of automaker Stellantis, has said: \u201cSo far, it\u2019s OK. Things are moving well.\"\nThe respite may not last. If shippers avoid the Suez Canal for a year, Flexport CEO Petersen warned, \u201cit\u2019s a really big deal.\" The higher costs would lead to \u201cgoods inflation of 1 to 2%.\"\nJan Hoffmann, a U.N. shipping expert, warned Thursday that Red Sea shipping snags posed a risk to global food security by slowing the distribution of grain to parts of Africa and Asia, which depend on wheat from Europe and the Black Sea area.\nIt would be even worse if the Middle East conflict widens and drives up oil prices, which are now lower than they were the day before Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7.\nFor now, companies are muddling through.\nRetailer Urban Outfitters\u2019 Free People subsidiary imports clothing from India and is shipping \u201ca lot of that through air,\" co-president Frank Conforti said at an investors\u2019 conference this month. But it\u2019s too costly to put furniture and household goods on planes.\nAt least home goods aren\u2019t as \u201cfashion-sensitive\" as clothing, Conforti said, so losing 15 days \u201csailing down the tip of Africa isn\u2019t the end of the world.\"\n____\nAnderson reported from New York.

        "article_content": "PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) \u2014 An Oregon weekly newspaper that had to lay off its entire staff after its funds were embezzled by a former employee will relaunch its print edition next month, its editor said, a move made possible in large part by fundraising campaigns and community contributions.\nThe Eugene Weekly will return to newsstands on Feb. 8 with roughly 25,000 copies, about six weeks after the embezzlement forced the decades-old publication to halt its print edition, editor Camilla Mortensen said.\n\u201cIt has been both terrifying and wonderful,\u201d Mortensen told The Associated Press, describing the emotional rollercoaster of the last few weeks. \u201cI thought it was hard to run a paper. It's much harder to resurrect a paper.\u201d\nThe alternative weekly, founded in 1982 and distributed for free in Eugene, one of the largest cities in Oregon, had to lay off its entire 10-person staff right before Christmas. It was around that time that the paper became aware of at least $100,000 in unpaid bills and discovered that a now-former employee who had been involved with the paper's finances had used its bank account to pay themselves around $90,000, Mortensen said.\nAdditionally, multiple employees, including Mortensen, realized that money from their paychecks that was supposed to be going into retirement accounts was never deposited.\nThe accused employee was fired after the embezzlement came to light.\nThe news was a devastating blow to a publication that serves as an important source of information in a community that, like many others nationwide, is struggling with growing gaps in local news coverage.\nThe Eugene police department\u2019s investigation is still ongoing, and forensic accountants hired by the paper are continuing to piece together what happened.\nLocal Eugene news outlets KEZI and KLCC were among the first to report the weekly's return to print.\nSince the layoffs, some former staff members have continued to volunteer their time to help keep the paper's website up and running. Much of the online content published in recent weeks has been work from journalism students at the University of Oregon, located in Eugene, and from freelancers who offered to submit stories for free \u2014 \u201cthe journalistic equivalent of pro bono,\u201d Mortensen said.\nSome former employees had to find other jobs in order to make ends meet. But Mortensen hopes to eventually rehire her staff once the paper pays its outstanding bills and becomes more financially sustainable.\nThe paper has raised roughly $150,000 since December, Mortensen said. The majority of the money came from an online GoFundMe campaign, but financial support also came from local businesses, artists and readers. The paper even received checks from people living as far away as Iowa and New York after news outlets across the country picked up the story.\n\u201cPeople were so invested in helping us that it just really gives me hope for journalism at a time where I think a lot of people don't have hope,\" she told the AP. \u201cWhen we saw how many people contributed and how many people continue to offer to help, you can't not try to print the paper. You've got to give it a shot.\u201d\nThe paper aims to continue weekly printing beyond Feb. 8."

It follows the arrest of three Machado aides for their alleged involvement in what the government said was a plot to kill Maduro.\nThe State Department said Friday\u2019s court process \u201clacked basic elements, as Machado neither received a copy of the allegations against her nor was afforded the opportunity to respond to those allegations.\u201d As a result of recent events, \u201cthe United States is currently reviewing our Venezuela sanctions policy.\u201d\nGerardo Blyde, the chief negotiator for the opposition, also blasted the court ruling, saying it violated the so-called Barbados deal between the US and Venezuela, and accused the government of trying to \u201cspread terror.\u201d He denied any opposition involvement in the alleged plot to assassinate Maduro.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t support any violent act,\u201d Blyde said in a press conference in Caracas. \u201cOur only goal is to achieve free elections.\u201d\nGovernment Response\nGovernment spokesman Hector Rodriguez rejected the criticism, said the court decision will stand and that the Barbados accord never mentioned a specific candidate. Those who have violated the constitution would be banned from the election, he said, adding that talks would continue.\n\u201cWe are still open to dialog,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cThere will be elections under international observation and audits, all candidates complying to Venezuelan laws will be able to participate.\u201d\nThe court said on Friday it was ratifying a 2021 decision by the Comptroller\u2019s Office that barred Machado, who\u2019s been leading opinion polls for the election, from running for public office for 15 years.\n\u201cMaduro and his criminal system decided to take the worst path for them: that of a fraudulent election,\u201d Machado wrote in a statement posted on social media, promising to keep fighting for free elections. \u201cLet there be no doubt, we\u2019re going until the end.\u201d\nWhile Machado said the court\u2019s decision effectively killed the Barbados deal, Maduro\u2019s chief negotiator Jorge Rodriguez said the government has complied with the mechanism established in the agreement, and will carry out elections this year as promised.\nDespite Venezuela\u2019s moves, bond investors have mostly held onto their bets that the sanctions will remain suspended.

There\u2019s reason for caution though, not least after data showed an unexpected pickup in inflation last month. That\u2019s on Thursday.\nRiksbank officials have already indicated that it won\u2019t be necessary to lift borrowing costs again, but their decision the same day could reveal how determined they are to keep rates high for now.\nIn Hungary on Tuesday, policymakers could follow through with another reduction in borrowing costs. Most economists are anticipating a 100 basis-point move down to 9.75%.\nThe week is also significant for data, with countries across the European Union set to release both growth and inflation numbers.\nBelgium and Sweden will publish such reports on Monday, followed the next day by several countries including Germany, France, Italy and Spain.\nFor the euro zone, economists anticipate the outcome to be a second quarterly contraction of 0.1% \u2014 meeting the typical definition of a recession.\nInflation reports from around the region are also due, culminating in the result for the currency zone as a whole on Thursday.\nA reading of 2.7% is expected there \u2014 still noticeably above the European Central Bank\u2019s target \u2014 while the so-called core gauge that strips out energy and such volatile elements may remain even higher.\nBeyond Europe, several other central banks will make announcements too:\nThe Bank of Ghana\u2019s decision on Monday is a close call on a possible cut. Inflation is continuing to slow, making its real rates among the world\u2019s highest. Even so, the IMF has cautioned against loosening.\nThe same day, Zimbabwe could explain its plans to handle a rout in the currency, which is down more than a third against the dollar on the official market so far this year.\nLesotho which has its currency pegged to South Africa\u2019s rand, may follow its neighbor on Tuesday and hold its key rate at 7.75% to support its economy.\nOn Wednesday, Mozambique is likely to keep borrowing costs unchanged to contain inflation even after the IMF said it has room to cut.\nEgyptian officials will meet the next day amid the worst economic crisis in decades, with investors ultimately anticipating a devaluation. While talks with the IMF continue, the central bank may still keep its rate at 19.25%.\nAmong data highlights, data on Wednesday may show Saudi Arabia\u2019s economy shrank for a second straight quarter at the end of 2023 after a contraction that mostly reflected a cut in oil production to push up prices. That\u2019s turned it from one of the Group of 20\u2019s fastest-growing members to one of its laggards.\nFor more, read Bloomberg Economics\u2019 full Week Ahead for EMEA\nLatin America\nBanco Central do Brasil has telegraphed delivery of a fifth straight half-point rate cut Wednesday to 11.25% and a sixth lined up for the March meeting.\nAnalysts surveyed by the bank see 9% by year-end but little leeway thereafter given sticky inflation expectations.\nBrazil also reports out December year-end industrial production and national unemployment.\nColombia\u2019s central bank is also all but certain to cut for a second straight month though analysts differ over the size of the reduction. A lower-than-expected December inflation reading my persuade the bank to go for a half-point trim to 12.5%.\nBanco Central de Chile has far more room for maneuver and may vote for a 100 basis-point move lower to 7.25%.

        "article_content": " \n\n \n\n \n\nBy Doyinsola Oladipo\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - The world's largest cruise ship is set for its maiden voyage on Saturday, but environmental groups are concerned that the liquefied natural gas-powered vessel - and other giant cruise liners to follow - will leak harmful methane into the atmosphere. \n Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) International's Icon (NASDAQ:ICLR) of the Seas sets sail from Miami with capacity for 8,000 passengers across 20 decks, taking advantage of the surging popularity of cruises. \nThe ship is built to run on liquefied natural gas (LNG), which burns more cleanly than traditional marine fuel but poses greater risks for methane emissions. Environmental groups say methane leakage from the ship's engines is an unacceptable risk to the climate because of its short-term harmful effects.\n\"It's a step in the wrong direction,\" said Bryan Comer, director of the Marine Program at the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), an environmental policy think tank. \n\"We would estimate that using LNG as a marine fuel emits over 120% more life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions than marine gas oil,\" he said. \nIn terms of warming effects, methane is 80 times worse over 20 years than carbon dioxide, making cutting those emissions key to holding down global temperature warming.\nCruise ships like Icon of the Seas use low-pressure, dual-fuel engines that leak methane into the atmosphere during the combustion process, known as \"methane slip,\" according to industry experts. There are two other engines used on bulk carriers or container ships that emit less methane but they are too tall to fit in a cruise ship. \nRoyal Caribbean says its new ship is 24% more efficient when it comes to carbon emissions than required by global shipping regulator the International Maritime Organization (IMO). \nLNG emits fewer greenhouse gases than very low sulfur fuel oil (VLSFO) that powers most of the global shipping fleet, said Steve Esau, chief operating officer of Sea-LNG, a industry advocacy organization. \nCruise engines convert natural gas into power in a cylinder, where it is \"important to make sure that all the natural gas is converted to energy,\" said Juha Kyt\u00f6l\u00e4, director of R&D and Engineering at W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4, which developed the cruise ship's engines. \nWhat is not converted can escape during the combustion process into the atmosphere, he said, adding that W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4's natural gas engine technology emits 90% less methane than it did 20 to 30 years ago.\nCruise ship engines have an estimated methane slip of 6.4% on average, according to 2024 research funded by the ICCT and other partners. The IMO assumes methane slip at 3.5%.\n\"Methane is coming under more scrutiny,\" said Anna Barford, Canada shipping campaigner at Stand Earth, a nonprofit organization, noting that the IMO last summer said its efforts to cut greenhouse gases includes addressing methane emissions.\nOf the 54 ships on order from January 2024 to December 2028, 63% are expected to be powered by LNG, according to the Cruise Line International Association. Currently, about 6% of the 300 cruise ships sailing are fueled by LNG.\nNewer cruise ships are being designed to run on traditional marine gas oil, LNG or alternatives like bio-LNG that only account for a fraction of U.S. fuel consumption. \nRoyal Caribbean will use different fuels as the market evolves, said Nick Rose, the company's vice president of environmental, social, and governance.\n\"LNG is one piece of our actual strategy,\" he said. \n\n \n"

The Chicago-based carrier expects a few passenger flights to operate on MAX 9s Saturday.\nThe blowout of a cabin panel on Jan. 5 on an eight-week-old MAX 9 operated by Alaska Airlines led the Federal Aviation Administration to ground 171 Boeing 737 MAX 9 jets, which resulted in the cancellation of thousands of flights by Alaska Airlines and United.\nThe FAA on Wednesday lifted its grounding order as it approved new inspection and maintenance checks and said Boeing could not expand 737 MAX production or add new 737 production lines pending quality improvements.\nThe 737 MAX 9 enhanced maintenance process requires inspection of specific bolts, guide tracks and fittings along with detailed visual inspections of mid-cabin exit door plugs and dozens of related components.\nAlaska Airlines resumed MAX 9 service on Friday. CBS News reported the airline's Chief Operating Officer Constance von Muehlen was on the first MAX 9 flight and sat next to the window in the same row where the blowout occurred on the earlier flight.\n\nAlaska Airlines said Friday it expects inspections on its MAX 9 to be completed by the end of next week, allowing the airline to operate its full flight schedule. The grounding impacted about 20% of its fleet.\nBoeing Commercial Airlines President Stan Deal told employees late Friday the company had \"worked diligently\" to create inspection criteria that would allow aircraft to be put back in service, and Boeing is now in the process of evaluating \"hundreds\" of ideas submitted by employees for quality improvements. \n\n \n"

No Chinese airlines operate MAX 9 aircraft.\nChinese airlines have at least 209 MAX planes on order from Boeing, according to aviation data provider Cirium. \nBoeing said in October that 85 of 250 finished MAX planes it had in its inventory were being held for customers in China. More MAX jets were being held for Chinese customers but due to the import freeze Boeing last year remarketed 55 of them to other customers.\nThe FAA's unprecedented intervention in production schedules could further delay some deliveries of new planes to airlines and hurt suppliers already reeling from an earlier MAX crisis and the pandemic.\nProviding Beijing continues to permit MAX imports, China looks unlikely to be affected by Boeing's production constraint as dozens of planes for Chinese customers stand ready for delivery.\nChinese airlines are estimated to take delivery of 64 MAX 8 jets in 2024, and 58 in 2025, Cirium data shows. \n\"Our data indicates that every single one of these expected (2024) deliveries has already flown and is in Boeing's current production inventory,\" said Rob Morris, head of global consultancy at Ascend by Cirium. \n\"There is potential for a significant number of these aircraft to be delivered,\" Morris said. \nThe MAX handover comes after Boeing in December made its first direct delivery of a 787 Dreamliner to a Chinese customer since 2019.\n\nChina is one of the fastest-growing aerospace markets, which Boeing projects will account for 20% of the world's aircraft demand through 2042.\nBoeing declined to comment on the delivery. China Southern and the Civil Aviation Administration of China did not respond to requests to comment. \n\n \n"

        "article_content": " \n\nBy Humeyra Pamuk\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden's administration on Friday formally informed Congress of its intention to proceed with the $23 billion sale of F-16 fighter jets to Turkey, taking a major step toward completing a long-delayed process that tested ties with Ankara.\nThe State Department sent the notification to advance the sale of 40  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) F-16s and nearly 80 modernization kits to Turkey, a day after Ankara fully completed ratification of the NATO membership of Sweden, a move that became directly linked to the jet sales.\nThe Biden administration simultaneously advanced the sale of 20 Lockheed F-35 stealth fighter jets to fellow NATO ally Greece, an $8.6-billion deal that Washington advanced as it tries to strike a balance between two alliance members with a history of tense relations.\nTurkey first made the request for the jets in October 2021, but Ankara's delay in approving the ratification of Sweden's NATO bid had been a major obstacle to winning congressional approval for the sale.\nFollowing 20 months of delay, the Turkish parliament earlier this week ratified Sweden's NATO bid, and subsequently U.S. President Joe Biden wrote a letter to key congressional committee leaders, urging them to approve the F-16 sale \"without delay.\"\nThe State Department's Friday night notification came only a day after Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan gave his final sign-off on Sweden's ratification, and hours after the instrument of accession was delivered to Washington.\n\"My approval of Turkey\u2019s request to purchase F-16 aircrafts has\u00a0been contingent on Turkish approval of Sweden\u2019s NATO membership.\u00a0But make no mistake: This was not a decision I came to lightly,\" said Democratic Senator Ben Cardin, chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, one of four key committees that needs to approve arms transfers.\nTurkey needs to urgently improve its human rights record, cooperate better on holding Russia accountable for its invasion in Ukraine and help lower the temperature in the Middle East, Cardin listed.\n\"My concerns have been strongly and consistently conveyed to the Biden administration as part of our ongoing engagement, and I am encouraged by the productive direction of their discussions with Turkish officials to address these issues,\" he said.\nLeaders of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and House of Representatives Foreign Affairs committees review every major foreign arms sale. They regularly ask questions or raise concerns over human rights or diplomatic issues that can delay or stop such deals.\n\nFollowing the transfer of the formal notification by the State Department, the Congress has 15 days to object to the sale, after which it is considered final.\nU.S. officials do not expect the Congress to block either sale, despite criticism of Turkey by some members.\n \n"

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to our CEO and President, Horacio Rozanski. We are now on slide four.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you, Nathan, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Matt and I are very excited to share excellent financial results with you today. Booz Allen's record-breaking fiscal year continues. Our best first half has now extended into our strongest three quarters of growth since our firm went public in 2010. I am so proud of our team. Thanks to their efforts, we have achieved the strategic and operational momentum we aim for under our VoLT strategy. Our financial performance has been remarkably consistent. This quarter, we continue to deliver industry-leading double-digit organic revenue growth. We remain ahead of pace on our multi-year investment thesis and again, expect to exceed our guidance for the fiscal year. Given the continuing uncertainty in the market, from ongoing budget debates, geopolitical conflicts and the upcoming election, our clear focus remains to accelerate momentum and increase resiliency across our institution. Matt will take you through the full details of the quarter and our outlook for the rest of the fiscal year. For the remainder of my remarks, I will focus on putting our continued success in the context of our VoLT strategy. Let me begin with a little historical context. 2024 is Booz Allen's 110th year. Since our earliest days, we have embraced continual transformation as an imperative for relevance in the market and long-term growth. From World War II to the Apollo missions to the advent of digital government, Booz Allen anticipated the next waves of change early and transformed to meet the needs of each moment. Our goal has always been to stay a step ahead of our clients' requirements and help them drive their own transformations. Our firm has outperformed the market for decades because of four primary differentiators. Our ability to anticipate and adapt. Our capacity to invest and innovate. Our position on critical national missions. And most important, most important, our exceptional talent. All these factors hold true today. The current iteration of our century-long transformation journey is called VoLT, which stands for Velocity, Leadership, and Technology. We have been implementing this program for the past 24 months. The strategic aims of VoLT are to get faster and elevate our client impact, which in turn accelerate our growth and drive exceptional shareholder value. Our third quarter results demonstrate a few important things about our strategic progress. First, we have built resilience and driven momentum into the business, even as the external environment remains dynamic and uncertain. Second, we have strengthened our leadership position in the market as we transform missions of national importance with emerging technologies. And third, we have gained speed and efficiency in how we operate and grow our workforce. In sum, our VoLT strategy is working. As examples, let's look at two key missions we are transforming and at the amazing people who do this work. First, China. The National Defense Strategy describes China as DoD's pacing challenge, and it outlines the top priorities to strengthen the U.S. deterrence mission. The sheer geographic scale of this mission, which encompasses nearly half of the Earth's surface, creates both urgency and unique complexity for our clients. Through years of investment in the right technologies, talent, and partnerships, we are more prepared than ever to help our clients translate urgency into speed at scale. Today, we have more than 600 employees in the Indo-Pacific region working across various aspects of this mission. We have also forward deployed our innovation ecosystem. This provides our clients with faster, more direct access to emerging technologies. Our client focus is on accelerated readiness, supporting allies and partners, and bringing AI and cyber to key mission priorities. While there is much work to do, we are already having impact. A relevant public example is our recent win of a small, but strategic contract to build a private 5G network for the United States Navy in Guam. This work will leverage our early investments and expertise in 5G, edge computing, and zero trust to support secure communications, operations, and logistics on the island. Finally, I'll note that our firm's focus on the pacing challenge is not limited to our growing presence in the Indo-Pacific. Leveraging our lessons from Ukraine and other conflicts, we are considering how to tailor our solutions across all of our sectors. And given the scale and complexity of the China mission, we are also engaging our network of technology partners to mount an all-of-nation approach. In short, we are deeply committed to helping our clients defend U.S. interests. Because this is a long-term priority for our nation, it will be a long-term priority for Booz Allen. Pivoting next to our health business. For more than a decade, Booz Allen has been at the heart of many federal healthcare transformations. For example, we have worked to modernize care and benefits delivery for our veterans, implement health reform, and accelerate how life-saving drugs are safely brought to market. Through the strength of our work across these and many other missions, the health portfolio has crossed the $2 billion annual revenue threshold. Today, building on that success, we are poised to help our country transform the future of public health. Our recent win of the Data Modernization Accelerator contract, or DMAC, at the Centers for Disease Control, is a tremendous opportunity to improve data interoperability across the public health ecosystem. Our years of innovating at the VA and our early investments in cloud, machine learning, generative AI, and cyber positioned us well to win this work. Now Booz Allen is playing an integral role in helping the CDC unlock the power of data at scale, so our country can better prepare for and respond to critical public health emergencies. I've just described a small sample of the work we do at the center of the missions that matter most. More broadly, we are leading the way in redefining intelligence collection, implementing zero trust, and preparing for a post-quantum world. We are also focused on accelerating U.S. space superiority by harnessing data to speed decision-making and mission outcomes. To that end, we recently made a venture investment in a company called Albedo to leverage their leading-edge imagery capabilities as new data collection sources for our clients. The strategic importance of all these missions, coupled with our outstanding execution, build resilience in our business, and our relentless implementation of VoLT drives our momentum. Today, we are exactly where we want to be as we live our purpose to empower people to change the world. Because more than anything, at our core, we are a company of purpose-driven professionals. People join Booz Allen because they have a passion for doing world-changing work. People stay at Booz Allen because we invest in them and provide unique opportunities to solve tough challenges inside essential missions. Simply put, our people catalyze the potential of Booz Allen. So, my final point in our success with VoLT connects to our record headcount growth over the past six quarters. This is the result of intentional and focused efforts of our recruiting and business leaders to transform our talent acquisition processes. We are hiring, onboarding, and moving our talent to the missions they are passionate about faster than at any time in our history. These process improvements, combined with our increased investment in talent, create the conditions to grow our headcount at speed. This is crucial to accelerating our overall growth, which allows us to continue to invest and outpace the market. It is incredibly gratifying to see how VoLT is fully woven into our business and evident in the results we share today. We recognize that the hiring market and other macroeconomic conditions have improved in recent months. Even in a strong market, our outperformance, headcount gains, and new opportunity capture are the outcome of the purposeful empowerment of our leaders to take action in alignment with our strategy. And with that, Matt, I'll turn the call over to you.\nMatt Calderone: Thank you, Horacio and thanks to all of you for joining our call today. I will start by saying that I am incredibly proud of the financial performance we are reporting today. Our third quarter results are further proof that our VoLT strategy is working and Booz Allen continues to build momentum. We are investing in cutting-edge technologies, hiring the right people, building critical partnerships, and winning work at scale. These strengths are the source of confidence and resilience in our business. As Horacio noted, we have now recorded the strongest first three quarters of a fiscal year since our IPO. Our performance has been remarkably consistent on the supply side, on the demand side, and in how we are operating the business. Based on this performance, we are ahead of pace against our three-year investment thesis, and we are especially pleased to raise our fiscal year 2024 guidance again today. Now let's dive into the details. Please turn to slide six. Total revenue for the quarter grew 12.9% year-over-year to approximately $2.6 billion. Organic revenue was up 12.8% year-over-year, and revenue excluding billable expenses increased 13% year-over-year to approximately $1.8 billion. This exceptional top-line performance was fueled by our strategic position in the market, robust demand for our services and solutions, and our ability to attract and retain elite talent. Taking it now sector by sector, our defense business continues to excel. Revenue was up roughly 17% compared to the third quarter of the last fiscal year. And this performance is strong and broad-based. Our team remains focused on accelerating access to data and decision-making tools and providing next-generation solutions to warfighters on critical missions across the globe. Our civil business is also growing fast, up roughly 18% year-over-year with double-digit growth across the portfolio. Booz Allen is unleashing the power of data to achieve better and faster mission outcomes for our civil government clients, from health and life sciences to infrastructure and climate. As anticipated, the pace of growth in our intelligence business slowed in the third quarter. Revenue declined 2% year-over-year. Our Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) leaders are winning exciting new work in key mission areas and have had success retaining critical talent, people who can now support cyber missions across the firm. This business is on a strong vector for the future. Finally, our global commercial business, which represented 2% of revenue in the quarter, was down about 22% year-over-year. This reflects divestitures disclosed last fiscal year and overall softness in the commercial cyber consulting market. Moving on to bookings on slide seven. The award environment is strong and our market leaders are doing an outstanding job shaping and winning work consistent with our VoLT strategy. Despite uncertainty about the near and long-term budget environment, our government clients and the people of Booz Allen remain laser-focused on meeting the country's urgent mission needs. This quarter, net bookings totaled nearly $1.9 billion. Our third quarter book-to-bill was 0.72 times, our best third quarter book-to-bill since fiscal year 2018. Our trailing 12-month book-to-bill was 1.41 times, well above our trailing five-year average. Total backlog as of December 31st stands at $34.3 billion, up 14.2% year-over-year. Funded backlog grew 15.4% to $5.2 billion. Unfunded backlog declined 9.2% to $9.2 billion. And priced options were up 29.3% to $19.9 billion. In sum, demand is strong. We have a solid foundation to remain the industry's organic growth leader. Turning now to headcount. Booz Allen closed out calendar year 2023 with nearly 34,000 people. Total headcount is up 8.6% year-over-year, and client staff headcount is up 9.2%. We efficiently deploy our people on contracts and ensure they are empowered to succeed. This people-centric culture, including continuous investments in our employees, furthers their commitment to Booz Allen and in turn makes them ambassadors to future talent. Since the start of the fiscal year, client staff has increased more than 6%, exceeding our expectations as well as the 3% to 5% target we had set for the year. This level of client staff growth, combined with our healthy bookings, positions us well for the next fiscal year. Moving now to the bottom line. We earned $291 million in adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter. This is 19.1% higher than the third quarter last fiscal year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.3% is roughly 60 basis points higher than for the same period a year ago. As you may recall, we manage the business on an annual basis. We indicated last quarter that we anticipated a somewhat flatter quarterly margin profile than in recent years. This pattern played out as we expected in the third quarter. Booz Allen pursues complex work that sits at the center of our client's mission and at the top of the technical stack. This requires us to invest ahead of the market. The quality of our work, coupled with our ability to get scale out of the business even as we ramp up investment, allows us to consistently deliver superior financial results. Third quarter net income was $146 million. The year-over-year increase of 374.6% in net income is primarily a result of the legal reserve of $124 million recorded in the third quarter of last fiscal year. This is partially offset by an increase in our provision for income taxes associated with the reversal of an uncertain tax position related to Section 174. Adjusted net income increased 29.4% year-over-year to $184 million. This excludes the impact of the legal reserve and the increase in our provision for income taxes. Due to the same factors, diluted earnings per share grew 382.6% year-over-year to $1.11, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 31.8% year-over-year to $1.41. Moving now to the balance sheet. We entered the third quarter with $602 million of cash on hand. Free cash flow for the quarter was $211 million, the result of $234 million of cash from operating activities plus $23 million of CapEx. Collections were strong for the quarter and included some payments we expected to receive in the fourth quarter. Cash outflows remained consistent with our outsized growth and sizable investments in our people and capabilities. Our net debt at the end of the third quarter was approximately $2.8 billion, and our net leverage ratio was approximately 2.5 times adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months. Turning to capital deployment on slide eight. We returned close to $156 million of capital to shareholders in the third quarter. This included approximately $94 million in share of purchases at an average price of $123.52 per share and $62 million in quarterly cash dividends. Today I am pleased to announce that our Board has approved a $0.04 increase to our quarterly cash dividend. This dividend of $0.51 per share will be payable on March 1st to stockholders of record as of February 12th. Now for a look ahead. On our last call, we updated our full year guidance to incorporate both the momentum we had built and the strong possibility of a two to 4-week government shutdown. Our revised guidance reflects the strength of our third quarter and the continued momentum of the business. While there is still uncertainty about government funding, we now believe that a multi-week government shutdown is significantly less likely to occur in our current fiscal year. Thus, we are no longer including a material shutdown related contingency in our guidance. Let me now take you through our updated fiscal year 2024 guidance. Please turn to slide nine. At the top line, we now expect revenue growth of 14% to 15%, 13% to 14% of which will be organic. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to between $1.155 billion and $1.175 billion, which equates to approximately 14% to 16% growth year-over-year. This implies an adjusted EBITDA margin of around 11%. We are also increasing our ADEPS guidance to a range of $5.25 to $5.40 per share. This is driven by the increase in EBITDA and a modest decrease in our ADEPS tax rate, which we now expect to be between 22% to 23%. We are raising our guidance for net cash provided by operating activities to be between $200 million and $275 million. This range includes a roughly $25 million increase in our estimated fiscal year 2024 cash taxes related to Section 174. And finally, we still expect CapEx of roughly $85 million, and we now expect free cash flow to be in the range of $115 million to $190 million. In closing, our business is performing exceptionally well. We have just delivered the best three quarters since Booz Allen's IPO, with remarkably consistent performance, even in the midst of geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties. This is a real testament to the quality of our leadership and the power of our VoLT strategy. Our firm is on a sustainable, quality growth path. The energy at Booz Allen is palpable. Our people are excited about the work they do, the impact they have, the strong performance we have delivered, and the many opportunities that lie ahead. With that, operator, let's open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] It comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning. Good morning, Horacio and Matt. Phenomenal quarter.\nHoracio Rozanski: Good morning, Sheila. Thank you.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Really amazing. Just wanted to maybe think about the growth trajectory in terms of my question, starting with civil. Double-digit growth for eight quarters now. Can you give us a little bit more detail about what's driving that? And then how much of that is related to public health and the T4NG program, and what Booz is doing in the next phase of that program?\nHoracio Rozanski: Sheila, I'll take that one. And great headline, by the way. But let me start by maybe framing the whole performance, and then I'll be happy to go down into civil. At the firm-wide level, these have been the best three quarters, and we're on track for the best fiscal year since going public in 2010. And frankly, I go back further than that, and this is as good as I've ever seen. And the performance has been remarkably consistent. And if anything, we've been positively surprised by the strength of our talent acquisition and retention program, which really, as you know, fuels our revenue expillables [ph], which is the most important part. It does feel like, as an organic growth leader, we're in this virtual circle of excellent work allowing us to capture exceptional talent, which deliver great results for our clients, which deliver great results for our shareholders, which allow us to invest in the next wave of technologies, and so on and so forth. So in short, VoLT, which is our commitment to strategy, is working. And we are creating resilience and momentum in the business, even as we see the reality of an uncertain budget and funding and political season ahead of us. And so really, at the firm-wide -- so let me talk about civil, and I'll come back. Our civil business has been a star in our portfolio for, as you said, multiple years. In the early years of that amazing run, it really was driven around public health and some specific agencies in there. But really, as we look at the business now, we are a leader in digital transformation. We're a leader in cyber and in AI, and that is broad-based across the entire portfolio. So while, as I said, our health business now has crossed the $2 billion mark, and is certainly the larger part of this business, all elements from citizen services to law enforcement, it's all really working together or humming together to produce the results that you see. And you didn't ask, but the same is true in defense. And we really see real momentum and growth opportunity also building in our national security business. So, I guess maybe to close out a little bit and bring it all together, 110 years young is Booz Allen. This business is as vibrant today as it's ever been.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you for that, and I knew you'd like the title. In terms of just another one for you, somewhat related to the top line, but where your margins are pushing ahead of your long-term targets, essentially, and there's been a lot of discussions about the government contracting differently. So, do you think the government is paying a premium for Booz just given the service offering?\nHoracio Rozanski: Yes and no. I mean, I do think that we -- and we've done this for years, we operate at the top of the market in terms of the capabilities that are required, the talent we need to bring, the investment we need to make. And so that will, over time, create higher economics. That is not true on every procurement for sure, but on average, there is some truth to that statement. I do think that the reason on the margin front that we're ahead of pace on our three-year investment thesis is that we knew this was going to be a heavy investment period. I don't think we fully anticipated how much efficiency we could create in the business to be able to invest from inside that efficiency and reinvest in the business from there, which has allowed us to preserve margins, even as we invest in talent, in capabilities, and in positions that I think hopefully will fuel the next round of growth.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. The question comes from the line of Bert Subin with Stifel. Please proceed.\nBert Subin: Hey, good morning, and thank you for the question.\nHoracio Rozanski: Good morning, Bert.\nBert Subin: Maybe just -- good morning. Horacio, just to follow up to some of your comments there around the business positioning growth. You've seen your staff headcount rise about 10% year-over-year, and organic growth is now in the teens levels relative to that 5% to 8% longer term expectation. As you think about that expectation, does that continue to be your view toward how the business should grow over time, or is something in your mind, be it AI or the geopolitical risk backdrop, accelerated how you think Booz can grow over the medium and long-term?\nHoracio Rozanski: I think what you're seeing right now, as I said, is the strength of our talent acquisition process, the ability to make investments in people, and a culture that keeps people here, coupled with a good environment out there and this unique positioning that we have around bringing technology to mission. I don't think that is a one-quarter or two-quarter or three-quarter deal. I think this is something that, if you extend it back, it goes back at least a decade or more, and if you extend it forward. I think this unique positioning is going to continue to allow us to outperform the market. That leads to the next question, which is, what is the market and how long will this type of market sustain? I think we are, honestly, very -- we appreciate the uncertainty in the funding environment. CRs running out in March, an election year, a political season that is going to add uncertainty to all of this, and we're watching that closely. One thing that is different this time than we've seen in the last couple of years is, typically, when you have this level of uncertainty, clients begin to pull back early because they're worried about the run rate, post-CR and into the future. We're not seeing that. We're actually seeing our clients be very focused on mission, very focused on investing in technology to bring to mission, and that is driving our growth today. Obviously, for the sake of Booz Allen, we want that to continue, but I think, for the sake of the country, this is a good thing.\nBert Subin: Got it. Okay. Thanks Horacio. And Matt, just a quick follow-up for you on the capital side of things. You mentioned your net leverage now 2.5 times, and that's on a trailing basis. If we look at that chart that you highlighted in the earnings presentation, you've been pretty balanced in how you've been allocating capital over the last couple of years. We've been starting to hear indications the M&A market is maybe getting a little better in terms of where seller expectations are and clearly where interest rates are going. As you think about M&A perhaps becoming a larger share of that capital allocation strategy, can you just talk about what you would look for in M&A and what you're not doing today that would be of interest to grow into inorganically?\nMatt Calderone: Yeah. Thanks, Bert. First, our strategy isn't changing from a capital deployment and M&A perspective. I think we've always been biased to M&A over share repo, but the right M&A, right, that's strategic and that really helps us fill a gap in a capability or a business model. We don't need to buy for scale. As Horacio mentioned, as the numbers indicate, we're growing 13% to 14% organically this year. We don't need scale. What we're looking for are unique and oftentimes niche capabilities or business models that'll help us accelerate into some of these waves of technology or into areas where we think, for example, outcome based contracting may emerge. So, I've heard the same commentary, Bert. I think we are seeing indications that more assets and potentially assets of scale will come to market. My leading indicator is always how many bankers are asking me to lunch. And my dance card is full, particularly from the New York bankers, which typically indicate that more assets of scale are coming to market. I'm not sure that we're seeing yet enough data points to call it that prices have come down, but I certainly hope they will. Thank you, Bert. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. And it comes from the line of Mariana Perez Mora with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nMariana Perez Mora: Good morning, everyone.\nHoracio Rozanski: Hola, Maria. Good morning.\nMariana Perez Mora: So, my first question -- hola. My first question is about China. So, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, all these like defense focus on China and the mission and the role that Booz Allen could play there. What are the opportunities around JADC2? Because you recently announced this collaboration with LHX, like how you can play with the primes, how you can play directly with the government and how large that opportunity could be.\nHoracio Rozanski: It's a great question. JADC2 is a key strategic initiative to bring together all the information that a co-com commander would need to operationalize. And it's therefore an important deterrent to aggression. So, we're very committed to it. We're a significant part of it. We work closely with the CDAO on a number of initiatives that feed into JADC2 and into other efforts that ultimately may or may not integrate together into it, but are all part and parcel of the same thing, which is how do you create full domain awareness? How do you create a decision cycle that takes advantage of all of the data available and that accelerates inside of a potential adversary's decision cycle? That is something that Booz Allen is very good at. Our understanding of the mission, our ecosystem of partners that bring technology at scale, and the at-scale part is the crucial part here. And frankly, our ability to co-create with them and to build pipelines of solutions are a big part of it. And this is really what VoLT has been all about, doing that fast, doing that at-scale and bringing the right technology. And that's what we're focused on.\nMariana Perez Mora: Great. Thanks so much for the color. And my follow-up question is about headcount. So, we see all these great increases in headcount and the client staffing, but I'm curious if you could discuss a little bit about the clearances, how they are performing. And also, post-pandemic, you were able to be really flexible and really agile to adapt to these remote working. How are the customer's appetite to these remote working solutions as we go back to business as normal in the post-pandemic world?\nMatt Calderone: Yeah. Mariana, it\u2019s Matt. I'll take it. I don't think we're seeing any material improvements in the processing of clearances. It may be on the margins in certain areas, but nothing that is material from a firm-wide perspective. To your second question, we have tried to, and our clients, take advantage of a lot of the lessons learned through COVID about remote work, about flexibility, about the opportunities to combine and recombine how people interact and engage in different ways. We learned a lot, for example, about remote hiring and how to make our hiring process more efficiently through COVID. That has absolutely carried forward through to today. So, we are seeing that our clients are more receptive to alternate work arrangements. We really pride ourselves on our flexibility. And as Horacio said, undoubtedly, the labor market has gotten a little looser in the last 12 to 18 months, and that's been helpful. But our performance really is intentional. And we talk a lot about remarkable consistency in the business. It has been particularly true on the labor side or on the supply side. Our attrition is down meaningfully. Employee satisfaction is up, which we care a lot about. Our average monthly applications are on pace to double year-over-year, and a lot of that is technology-enabled. And we've seen an almost 60% increase in referrals, employer referrals, over the last three years. And I think that's, in many ways, the best indication of our employee value proposition and the fact that our employees are willing and eager to recommend us as a place to work and employer of choice to their network. So, the short answer to your question is yes. The longer answer is it requires a lot of work, and it's been very intentional.\nMariana Perez Mora: Perfect. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And it comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please proceed.\nCai von Rumohr: Yes, thanks so much. So, great quarter. You talked about, I mean, Intel was down, not unexpectedly, with FocusedFox. But you talk about that looking good. Give us some color on where you see it going from here. Have we passed the bottom? And secondly, you didn't talk much about global commercial. And this is the first quarter. It wasn't basically flat to down sequentially. It had a nice uptick. So, are we seeing something of a turn there?\nHoracio Rozanski: I'll start with global commercial for a moment, and then spend more time on national security, if that's okay, Cai.\nCai von Rumohr: Yeah.\nHoracio Rozanski: Our global commercial business is really a small part of the portfolio. The numbers this quarter still reflect divestitures and softness in the commercial consulting side of the market, which I think is echoed by everything we see what's happening in the consulting industry in general. At this point, our incident response business there has accelerated. It's doing really great, and it's an important part of the offering. But what we really like about commercial is its connectivity to the rest of our business. If you think about our national cyber platform, adversaries look at the entire attack surface of the United States, and they don't care if it's private or public or at the intersection. And so, having this presence that cuts across. Makes us a valuable partner to our government clients as we support them here. But again, it's a small part of the portfolio. On the national security front, you explained already why the numbers are what they are this quarter. What we're seeing into the future is a business that has repositioned against the true technology side of intelligence. There's a lot more. AI space is growing as a significant part of our business. Our clients now look to us to create unique solutions. And they trust us to help them scale those solutions. We've spoken before, and Matt just talked about that business always is a little bit rate limited by the speed at which we can clear people or transfer clearances if they already have them. But even with that, we anticipate the growth and accelerating and building. They want some really interesting work. They have some great pipeline and the talent is staying, including some of the cyber talent that we talked about in the past is staying at Booz Allen and getting redeployed and redistributed against some of these key mission priorities.\nCai von Rumohr: Terrific. And a second one, the whole industry has benefited from a much looser labor environment. But you talked about that you're doing much better than you ever have in terms of taking people from higher to putting them onto the mission. Maybe give us some color in terms of what you're doing there to get that improvement.\nHoracio Rozanski: I'll start. I guess Matt's also been close to this. Credit to this goes to this is all done under the leadership of Kristine Martin Anderson, our COO, and she assembled a team from all of our enterprise operations and the markets to work this problem together to maximum effect. We used to have -- first of all, the first thing we identified is that the time we were not taking full advantage of the people that were applying, because we were too stovepiped in our approach. We have now built much more -- using both technology and process, much more cross-functional, cross-market view of this. So, easiest way to explain it is the runner up for a position doesn't get lost in the system, becomes all of that knowledge, positions that person for another similar opportunity. And again, that allows us to mine our incoming talent pipeline much more. Once we do that, we have gotten a lot better at shortening the cycle from the time we want to extend an offer to the time a person can join. That has been a lot of small changes, but each one of those significant. So that has been shortened. And then we're really very focused both for our incoming talent and for existing talent about giving them full access to the opportunity set that exists right here, right now. That helps attrition, because people stay longer if they can change jobs if they want to. But it really helps our new folks. We used to have this rule of thumb that it took 60 days to get somebody fully billable once they came through the door. That created fictional billability issues when we were hiring significantly like we are now. We have shattered that expectation. I don\u2019t -- I couldn't tell you what the actual number is today, in terms of reaching full billability, but it is a fraction of what it used to be. And when you put all of that together, that drives employee satisfaction. It drives economics. It frankly allows us to recruit with a somewhat -- to run this business at growth with a somewhat smaller bench. So, it's all to the good and it's all intentional. And then coupled with all the training that we're doing and all the things that we're doing to upskill people and to keep them here, I think that's why you're seeing what you're seeing. So it's not -- and I agree with you, the market is a little easier than it was 18 months ago, two years ago. But I do think that part of this is all of these changes that we've made have, again, allowed us to outperform the labor market.\nMatt Calderone: And Cai, I can just add two things to what Horacio said. We typically talk about supply and demand separately and that in the short run, we're more supply constrained, but obviously the two work in sync. So, part of the reason that we're able to deploy people quickly on jobs is a lot of work out there, right? Our book-to-bill for -- LTM is now over 1.4 times. So, we have sold an awful lot of work. There's tremendous demand for employees, both internally in our internal marketplace, as Horacio mentioned, and externally in the hiring marketplace. And that's why, as Horacio said, our bench is actually at the lower end of what we've seen historically and why we are continuing to step on the gas from a talent acquisition standpoint. The other point I make is this remarkable consistency we've seen, not just over the last nine months, but really I think the last 18 from a labor standpoint has broken some of the historic norms and I think has tended to even out some of the peaks and valleys we see in utilization. And we are very consistently adding 150, 200 heads every month. And it just makes this -- it allows the system to work on a more regular basis.\nCai von Rumohr: Great answer. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And one moment for our last question. And it comes from Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.\nMatthew Akers: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for the question.\nHoracio Rozanski: Good morning.\nMatt Calderone: Good morning, Matt.\nMatthew Akers: So, I have a follow-up, I guess one more on the hiring. Is there a headcount growth number baked into your long-term 5% to 8% organic growth number? And based on what you're seeing, do you think, I guess, into 2025, maybe we still come in ahead of that based on some of the strengths you've talked about?\nMatt Calderone: Yeah. Thanks Matt. And I'll actually tie this question together with a piece of what Sheila asked. We have said historically that for us to hit our growth targets, we aspire to have our LTM book-to-bill in the 1.2 to 1.3 range and our headcount in, let's say, the mid-single digits. And obviously, we're ahead of the mark on both measures. So, our LTM book-to-bill is 1.41 times and our annualized headcount growth is above 9% on the client staff. And if you look just over the first nine months, we're above 6%, which, again, is above historic targets and above our expectations for this year. So, we're not getting ahead of guidance. As Horacio said, we're acutely aware of some of the political and macroeconomic uncertainty, but there's a lot of momentum in the business. And we feel very comfortable with where we are.\nHoracio Rozanski: Hey, Matt. I love the fact that we're getting all these questions about talent. I think this is the most important topic. And so, I'll just maybe take us on a slight detour, and I hope you don't mind. But there's a natural tendency to look at companies like ours as a collection of contracts. And I do think, and this call proves it, that misses a little bit of the point. Because what we are is really a collection of people, in fact, more than a collection, an intentional team, purposeful team of people who serve clients leveraging contracts. And so, while the contracts are not important, it's really the strength of the talent base that we focus on to drive this business forward. And I think that has served us well and will continue to.\nMatthew Akers: Thanks. That's a great color. And I guess one more for Matt on cash taxes. Why did the Section 174 impact go up? And also, I think there's a bill going through to try to repeal that. Is there a way to think about how much you guys could get back if that happens? Is it kind of a few hundred million that potentially you could get?\nMatt Calderone: Yeah. Thanks Matt. Three things happened this quarter with taxes, two of which are pretty straightforward, and one of which is a little more complex. So, why don't I go through them in turn and answer your explicit question. First, we saw about $11 million benefit related to a foreign tax credit once we filed our 2023 tax returns. This is largely what drove us to reduce our full year ADEPS tax rate to 22% to 23%. Now, second, getting to 174, two things happened. We increased our estimated 2024 cash taxes related to 174 by about $125 million, from $100 million to $125 million. And that's really because we completed a thorough contract-by-contract analysis of the 174 impact. And we baked that $25 million into our cash guidance. And then lastly, based both on the contract review as well as the increased clarity from the IRS that we all received on the scope of 174, we rehearsed on a certain tax position that we began recording last Q4, and there was a knock-on effect to that tax position where we had decreased our GAAP tax -- we decrease our GAAP tax provision beginning in Q4 last year. We actually reversed that this quarter. We adjusted both of those out to provide a better view of what our steady state tax rate would be. So that's the explicit reason. We did a contract-by-contract review. If you take a step back, it's simply the size of our growth, right? And we're investing consistent with that growth is what drove our 174 tax expectations up for this year. With respect to what's happening on the Hill, we're obviously tracking it. Over time, you'd expect it to be completely reversed. Does it come in the form of a refund or credits? I don't think we know at this stage how -- whether it will happen, and if so, how it would be implemented. But ultimately, we would get all that cash back, and that would be used to further our capital deployment objectives.\nHoracio Rozanski: Just to make one quick point as we close off, and Matt said this, but I just want to double click on it because this 174 topic is complex, to say the least. I just want to make it clear the outperformance that we had this year was almost entirely driven by exceptional top line performance, exceptional margin performance, and really good cost management that has delivered the results that you're seeing through the first nine months.\nMatthew Akers: Got it. Thank you both.\nOperator: Thank you. And this concludes the Q&A answer period. I will turn back to Horacio Rozanski for final comments.\nEnd of Q&A:\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you, Carmen. Thank you all for your questions and for joining us this morning. Before we close, allow me to take a moment to publicly express my deepest gratitude to each and every one of our incredible colleagues. The collective efforts of the nearly 34,000 people of Booz Allen produce the exceptional results that Matt and I have the privilege of discussing with you today. We're very proud of you, Booz Allen. We thank you for the passion and the commitment that you bring every day and for the world changing work that you do. And on that note, thank you again for joining us this morning and have a great day.\nOperator: And with that, thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor. For more information see our T&C."

Welcome to Glacier Bancorp's Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Randy Chesler, President and Chief Executive Officer of Glacier Bancorp. Mr. Chesler, please begin.\nRandy Chesler: All right. Thank you very much. Sorry for the technical difficulties. I think, we're ready to go. So, good morning, and thank you for joining us today. With me here in Kalispell this morning is Ron Copher, our Chief Financial Officer; Angela Dose, our Chief Accounting Officer; Byron Pollan, our Treasurer; Tom Dolan, our Chief Credit Administrator and Don Chery, our Chief Administrative Officer. I'd like to point out that the discussion today is subject to the same forward-looking considerations found on Page 14 of our press release, and we encourage you to take a careful review of this section. We released our fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings after the close of the market yesterday, and the Glacier Bancorp team wrapped up a challenging year with a very strong quarter. We achieved earnings per share of $0.49, which increased $0.02 per share from the prior quarter. Net income was $54.3 million for the current quarter, an increase of $1.9 million, or 4%, from the prior quarter. Interest income of $273 million in the current quarter increased 8.6 million, or 3%, over the prior quarter. Net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis was 2.56% versus 2.58% in the prior quarter, our smallest quarterly decrease this year. Total non-interest expense of $132 million for the current quarter, including a one-time $6 million FDIC special assessment, increased only $2.6 million, or 2%, over the prior quarter. The portfolio loan yield of 5.34% increased seven basis points from the prior quarter. New loan production yields were 8.24%, up 32 basis points from the last quarter. Non-performing assets to bank assets decreased $16.7 million, or 39% from the prior quarter to 9% or nine basis points of assets. Net charge-offs to total loans ended the year at only six basis points. Provision expense for the quarter was $3 million, which was stable, compared to the prior quarter provision expense of $3.5 million. The allowance for credit losses, as a percentage of total loans outstanding at year-end was 1.19%, flat to the prior quarter, and relatively unchanged, compared to the 1.2% in the prior - year fourth quarter. While the industry saw a significant outflow of deposits during the year, the company's core deposits and retail purchase agreements only decreased $108 million, or 50 basis points from the prior year-end. The company ended the year with $1.3 billion in cash, which was an increase of $952 million over the prior year-end. Stockholders' equity of $3 billion increased $146 million for the quarter, or 5%, and increased $177 million, or 6%, over the prior year-end. The company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.33 a share, and the company has declared 155 consecutive quarterly dividends, and has increased the dividend 49 times. And we received all regulatory approvals for the acquisition of Wheatland Bank, a leading Eastern Washington community bank headquartered in Spokane, with total assets of $728 million as of the end of the year. This will be our 25th acquisition since 2000, and we will close the transaction on January 31. We welcome the Wheatland team to Glacier Bancorp. Despite the significant volatility in the banking industry in 2023, with two of the largest bank failures in history, depositors' fear of bank safety and historic interest rate increases, the Glacier team did an excellent job taking care of customers and communities across the West, and ended 2023 well-positioned for a strong 2024. So that ends my formal remarks, and I would now like Norma to open the line for any questions that our analysts may have.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] One moment for our first question, please. Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Clark with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nMatthew Clark: Hi, good morning, guys.\nRandy Chesler: Good morning, Matthew.\nMatthew Clark: Starting on expenses, the run rate, well below the prior guidance of $132 million to $134 million. Can you speak to not only the run rate that you expect going forward, excluding Wheatland, but also maybe provide some color behind the staffing efficiencies that you gained? Just maybe speak to what exactly was done there?\nRon Copher: Yes, Matthew, Ron here. So yes, what you recognize, we're proud to be recognized for that, but in terms of the staffing especially, but - so the guide, it was $132 million to $134 million, and if you remove the FDIC, $6 million and some M&A of $500,000 you get down to the roughly $126,000. But our compensation was down by about $6 million. And I want to normalize for that, because that included the performance-related, performance-based pay that totals about $6 million. So when you bring it all back, $132 million is basically what we came in at. And then when you look forward for the guidance for Q1, excluding Wheatland, we would be at $138 million to $140 million. And then when you add in $6 million for Wheatland, the guide for the full first quarter, $144 million to $146 million. That should be the high for each of the quarters in 2024. It's typical the first quarter runs high. You get the full impact of the - pay increases, the FICA tax, the employer portion kicks in. And so that's how that reconciles there. So the FTE count has continued to migrate down, particularly in the second and third quarters. The division, the teams, the corporate departments all did an outstanding job. Continuing into the fourth quarter, we had another 20 FTE reduction. So, overall for the full year was a 96 FTE reduction. And a lot of that is attributable to the technologies that we've talked about, I think, on each of the calls. As we continue to implement those, think of the account opening process, cut that in half, even doing better now. The - instead of doing end of day closing, we've gone to real time adjustments. That's greatly set up that process, but construction program we added built, been very, very good. Treasury management's making great strides. It's all very positive. We do continue to believe that we'll have some additional reductions in staffing. Probably not to that same degree. Remember, we're bringing on Wheatland and they've got 14 branches. So, we feel pretty good about what we're able to achieve, certainly for the year, but in particular the fourth quarter.\nMatthew Clark: Okay. That's great, thank you. And shifting gears to the margin, the three part question there. If you had the spot rate on deposits at the end of the year, the average NIM in the month of December, and then what's your deposit beta assumption, on the way down with rate cuts at this stage?\nByron Pollan: Hi, Matthew, this is Byron. I can address that. So spot rate for total deposits in December, this is a December 31 total deposit spot rate, 1.30%. You asked for the margin, the December margin, that was 2.59%. And beta on the way down. I think what we'll likely see, as the Fed begins to cut rates, I think what we'll likely see is an adjustment period. Maybe a lag in customer expectations as well, as in the competitive deposit environment. I think for the first few cuts, we're expecting a lower beta on the way down, maybe less than 10%. I think we will see some opportunities, some near term opportunities to reduce rate. Our first rate reduction opportunity will be really with a higher cost CD that, we've ramped up in recent quarters. I'm thinking of our CD specials that, we have in place. We've kept our CD specials intentionally short. Almost 60% of our CDs mature in the first quarter. And so that will afford us an opportunity to reprice those CDs as they mature, and as market rates are falling. And so that's our expectation. I think, it'll take a little bit of time for the down rate beta to gain some traction. And for the first few cuts, we're thinking less than 10% on the way down.\nMatthew Clark: Okay. Great. And then on the loan portfolio, particularly within residential construction and land lots and other construction that's come down the last couple of quarters, I assume those are just projects being completed. But maybe speak to the trend there. Is it maybe being a little more cautious on that front, or is it just tough to get things, find workers and get things done?\nTom Dolan: Yes Matt, this is Tom. Yes, the reduction in the Construction segments, that you're absolutely right. That's a function of projects getting completed and - moving into the perm functions, which is why you saw one to four family, multi-family, some other CRE segments lift in the quarter. In terms of volume in the Construction segments, we're definitely seeing a reduction there, really across the board, residential and commercial construction. And I think - it's really twofold. We are being more selective and cautious than we normally are, even more so than our existing conservative underwriting standards. But we've also seen customers waiting on the sidelines to get a little bit more clarity on what's going to happen. And so, there definitely is some pent up demand out there. With the current interest rate environment, especially on the commercial side, it takes certainly more cash equity to make a deal pencil, to our underwriting standards. So, I think all those things combined or, have the construction production muted a bit.\nMatthew Clark: Okay. And then last one from me, bit of a two part question around M&A. Great to see you guys getting the regulatory approvals here. Does this elongated approval process change your appetite in wanting to do deals? And if not, can you speak to kind of the incremental change in conversations you've had over the last quarter?\nRandy Chesler: Sure. Well, we're 30 days longer than what we expected. So, I think that we are very, very happy to get all the approvals and get it closed. No, I don't think this will change our appetite one bit. I think it will change our expectations that we set at the beginning of these and allow more time for the regulatory approval. Terms of activity, yes, the market has picked up. We are getting more inbound calls and a lot of very interesting opportunities. So, I think coming out of '23, there is just a little more of an increase in inquiries, interest, as well as different types of opportunities, be it whole banks, or branches, or just quite a bit of more activity picking up. We'll see if it continues, Matthew, but at the start here, market increase.\nMatthew Clark: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. Our next question comes from the line of David Feaster with Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nDavid Feaster: Hi, good morning, everybody?\nRandy Chesler: Good morning, David.\nDavid Feaster: Maybe just starting on the deposit front, I'm curious some of the dynamics that you're seeing there. And if you could help us think about like - how much of the deposit flows that you saw in the quarter would you attribute to maybe client activation, or perhaps some seasonality? Hoping you could quantify that and just kind of how you think about deposit growth going forward and really, I guess, the overall balance sheet size. Obviously, probably targeting core deposit growth, but would you expect the balance sheet to remain relatively stable and just remix the book?\nByron Pollan: Sure, David, this is Byron. I'll start with deposits. Our deposit flows in Q4 were primarily driven by our non-interest bearing decline. We also had some decline in our brokered CDs. We just let those mature and run off. In terms of our outlook for total deposits, for '24, we do think we'll be reverting back to some typical seasonal patterns. I think, we'll be down in the first quarter. But on the year, I think we'll be likely flat versus where we ended in '23. That's in terms of total deposits. Digging into the non-interest-bearing a little bit, the majority of our non-interest-bearing decline came from typical seasonal outflows. Another driver that we looked at, though, the bulk of the outflow of non-interest-bearing came from business accounts. And so, we looked at what type of businesses saw balance decline. The top three categories were all related to the housing market. So title company balances were down. Construction accounts, contractor accounts, those kinds of things. And so, no surprise there, given recent headlines, that housing activity is at a very, very slow pace, a low point. I think I've seen a 30-year low in some headlines. I would say, on the other hand, when we're talking about non-interest-bearing balances. The rate motivated migration is slowing. That trend has been slowing in recent quarters. And in Q4, it was half of what it was in Q3. So, there is still some rate-seeking migration there, but it's much slower than it has been in previous quarters. And I think that trend will continue to slow. In terms of the outlook for non-interest bearing, I think we could continue to see some outflow of non-interest-bearing balances, some remix there. I would say this is where Wheatland will give us a real boost. They're very strong on the non-interest-bearing balances. Their total deposit base is over - 45% non-interest-bearing, which is very strong. Now, there's some seasonality to that. It is influenced by the Ag cycle and what's going on there, but very encouraged by the strong deposit base that Wheatland, is bringing to the balance sheet.\nDavid Feaster: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just touching on the securities book, could you first remind us the cash flows that you're expecting off that book near term? And I know you sold some securities again this quarter. Curious your thoughts on maybe being more active on managing that book, and at what point you'd maybe be interested in restructuring. And then just to your point on Wheatland, whether there's any - rates have come down since that deal was announced. Just curious if there's any additional opportunity - for balance sheet optimization, inclusive of that deal?\nRandy Chesler: Yes, Byron could comment on the investment portfolio. The gain there, David, was the sale of the Visa B shares. And so, we've been holding on to those for quite a while, 1.7 million. We thought this was a good time based on a lot of factors to exit those shares. So that was the gain that you saw this quarter.\nDavid Feaster: Got it, got it.\nByron Pollan: Sure, David, back to cash flow on the securities portfolio. We are expecting about $250 million a quarter in securities cash flow that's through the end of this year. In terms of restructuring, I don't think, as Randy mentioned, we didn't sell anything in the fourth quarter. I don't think, we'll be looking to - sell anything out of our portfolio. When Wheatland does come to us, we are looking to sell those securities. And so, the securities currently in their portfolio will be liquidated in February and will just become part of our overall part of liquidity.\nDavid Feaster: Got it. Perfect. And then maybe just touching on the loan growth side. Obviously, loan growth slowed and I know you're very conservative. You've done a great job pushing pricing. I'm curious, how much of that slowdown would you attribute to being strategic on your end, and just less appetite for growth versus maybe weaker market demand, or just a less certain backdrop for the borrowers? And just any thoughts, on how you think about loan growth going forward?\nOperator: Please stand by. They just dropped. Ladies and gentlemen, please remain on your line. The call will resume momentarily. Again, ladies and gentlemen, please stand by. Your call will resume momentarily.\nOperator: David, you might want to ask your question again.\nDavid Feaster: Yes, sure. The question was just kind of on the loan growth side. Loan growth slowed in the quarter. I know you guys have a pretty conservative posture. You guys have done a great job pushing, improving loan yields. I'm curious how much of the slowdown in loan growth was strategic on your end and you all just having less appetite for growth versus weaker market demand, and maybe a less certain economic backdrop as your clients are looking out, and just how you think about loan growth more broadly going forward?\nTom Dolan: Sure, yes David. This is Tom. I really think it's twofold. We have been more selective, especially around higher risk areas, especially in uncertain economic times, speculative repayment, cash out refi based on market appreciation. Those are things that we're even more conservative on now than we have been. I think that's a portion of it. I think the other side of it is, we do still have a lot of borrowers, a lot of developers waiting on the sidelines until they're comfortable with kind of the market outlook. And as Byron mentioned, the slowdown in the residential side, we've seen our - builder finance and subdivision finance is not a big business line for us. But we do make some very well-heeled multi-recession tested developers and they've proactively scaled down as well, just kind of seeing what was coming on the forefront. So, I really think it's twofold, us being more selective, borrowers being more cautious. In terms of the production yield that we saw, you know, we have done, that our bank division has done a phenomenal job getting strong pricing on our deals. That hasn't really slowed growth that much. You know, I'm constantly talking to our bank divisions. So, I'm not hearing that we're losing deals over pricing. It's generally just overall pipelines, are muted from where they were back in the heyday, although they have been somewhat stable in the last couple of quarters. And the tailwinds we saw at the first half of '23 with a lot of construction draws, as those deals have moved through to completion and into the perm category, we're just not replacing the construction volume at the same pace that we were as expected. And then to answer your last question on our go forward outlook for 2024, we're thinking low to mid-single-digits for the year.\nDavid Feaster: Perfect. Thanks everybody.\nRandy Chesler: All right, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. Our next question comes from the line of Kelly Mota with KBW. Your line is now open.\nKelly Motta: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question.\nRandy Chesler: Good morning, Kelly.\nKelly Motta: I wanted to ask about the, about $2.7 billion of BTFP that you guys have. Just wondering what your plans are there with replacing that amount and how we should be thinking about that in context of the balance sheet overall?\nByron Pollan: Sure, Kelly, this is Byron. As we have $2.74 billion of BTFP balances, those mature in March. The rate curve in Q4 allowed us to lock in some forward starting FHLB advances. We locked in $1.8 billion of forward starting advances, at a very similar rate, as we have our BTFP borrowing rate. That's on a dividend adjusted basis. Those forward starting advances will begin in March, to coincide with the maturity of the BTFP borrowing. And we ladder those maturities from 12 to 24 months. And so, we spread the refinancing of that over five quarters. So, we locked in the $1.8 billion. That leaves us with $940 million left to refinance in March. And we've got some flexibility and options there. We've got a little bit of extra cash right now. We could use some of that to paydown that $940 million. We'll look at what the overnight borrowing environment is then. We'll look at what the curve looks like, in terms of term FHLB advances. And so, we'll keep our options open. We'll evaluate that last $940 million as we get closer to maturity.\nKelly Motta: Got it. That's super helpful. Thank you. And you alluded to the higher levels of liquidity you have. Can you remind us where you're comfortable running those cash balances for what more normalized level?\nByron Pollan: Sure. We could bring our cash down to somewhere in the $500 million to $750 million range. Somewhere in that zone, is probably a more comfortable level.\nKelly Motta: Okay. Super helpful. And then just on the margin overall, it's really encouraging the - future around about the spot rates and what not. It seems like we've - somewhat reached the bottom. But I was just wondering what you guys are expecting in terms of the glide path of NII this year and margins really, especially considering potential rate cuts may be given the forward curve?\nByron Pollan: Sure, yes. Q4 margin was down only two basis points. That was a significant improvement over the pace of decline that we have seen in prior quarters. So very encouraged by that. We are seeing signs of stabilization. The biggest driver of that, is the slowing of our deposit cost increase. So in terms of our outlook, I think we do see Q1 continued stabilization. I think from there we'll see an inflection point, likely somewhere in the second quarter. And then we see growing NIM from there. We are also encouraged by, again, Wheatland and the list that they will help provide on the margin side. That will be helpful to put a range, in terms of our expectations for the full year. I think, we'll come in on the full year '24 somewhere in the range of $280 million to $290 million. And so - that's given our current rate outlook that includes three cuts in '24. Spread evenly throughout quarters two, three, and four later this year.\nKelly Motta: Got it. That's super helpful. And if we were to get more rate cuts more in line with the forward curve, just directionally, what would you anticipate? That would, how would you anticipate that, would impact that expectation?\nByron Pollan: I think - it would be helpful. So, I think our margin could improve even above the range that I mentioned previously.\nKelly Motta: Okay. Awesome, that's really helpful. Last question I wanted to ask was on expenses. I think you had said inclusive of Wheatland's $144 million to $146 million in Q1. That was a little higher than where I was. Can you remind us, and that's a partial impact of Wheatland. Can you just remind us the dollar amount of cost that, you anticipate expecting for Wheatland and overall core expenses? It seems like from the release and your commentary, you're looking to control. I'm just wondering, if what you're anticipating in terms of kind of core expense outlook there?\nRon Copher: Yes Kelly, Ron. Let me go back. I just want to make sure. The $144 million to $146 million guide that includes Wheatland. So just to go back to the core, ignoring Wheatland, we're going to go from $132 million in the fourth quarter. We'll go up to $138 million to $140 million, just on the divisions we already had. And then you add another $6 million so the guide, becomes $144 million to $146 million. And on the expenses, we are - in the model that we built, we assumed a 20% reduction of their non-interest expense. And that would be layered in 50% in '24 and then 100% in '25. And we feel that's very, very achievable. I don't have the exact dollar amount. I just remember it's 20% based in 50% '24, 100% '25.\nKelly Motta: Got it. And if you're adding, that $6 million that they're adding for the quarter, is that inclusive of any one-time, non-operating kind of just merger charges in that? And that's a 16-month contribution?\nRon Copher: Yes so, it's in there, but it's not a really big number. So, we just are giving the guide $144 million to $146 million.\nKelly Motta: Okay. And that's a two-month contribution from them?\nRon Copher: Yes, two months, thank you.\nKelly Motta: Got it, awesome. Thank you so much. I really appreciate all the color today. I'll step back.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Rulis with D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.\nJeff Rulis: Thanks, good morning.\nRandy Chesler: Good morning, Jeff.\nJeff Rulis: Hi, Randy. Not to chase down the margin too much, and I think you framed up really well, Byron, particularly that last piece. I just wanted to get sensitivity. You do screen fairly liability sensitive, so I just want to make sure if, in that three-cut scenario and kind of upward trending. And you talked about kind of the beta on the way down on deposits. Is that would that extend into '25 then, some of that favorable kind of tailwind in a three-cut environment, and then conversely, kind of margin expectations, should there be no cuts this year? Is there kind of a core lift, or is - trying to chase that down? Thanks.\nByron Pollan: Sure. I'll start with expectations, if we don't see cuts. I think we could still see margin growth. The pace of that growth will be a lot slower, and the key to that is stabilization of our deposit costs. We're already seeing good signs there. And so, we're kind of flattening out the curve of that deposit cost increase. And so, I think that will happen even without cuts. It may push out that inflection point. I mentioned second quarter. It may push that inflection point out further in the year, but I still think we could see some growth, although more limited, even if the Fed doesn't cut rates this year.\nJeff Rulis: Okay. And I guess the not so clear question that was, into '25, you talked about that three-cut lift to kind of $280 million, $290 million range. As we progress into '25, can we see further lift? Is there sort of a tail of that beta down scenario where you foresee an environment where margin can continue to propel higher in '25, a long time from now, but just thoughts on that?\nByron Pollan: Sure, I do think we'll see some tailwind into '25. The way our balance sheet is structured, we get most of the benefit kind of in year two of a rate move. And so, with three rate cuts in '24, we'll gain momentum into '25. If there are further cuts beyond that, it'll be even better, so yes, I do think the outlook for '25 is really positive.\nJeff Rulis: Okay. I appreciate it, thank you. And Randy, I appreciate the M&A just kind of appetite and conversation. The dividend rate has been flat for a little while now, and I know that's a Board discussion, but - we read anything into that in terms of holding capital for maybe a more active M&A, or is that a separate channel that looking at the dividend, you can kind of do both, just more specifically asking about the dividend? Thanks.\nRandy Chesler: Sure, we're comfortable where the dividend is. I don't see it changing, and I think this is still an environment where capital is king. And so, we'll stay the course with the dividends in the foreseeable future. Again, that's up to the Board, but that's my expectation.\nJeff Rulis: Okay. Maybe some of those hikes were kind of - post-pandemic kind of, there was some moves there, I suppose. Anyway, I think you answered it, I appreciate it. The last one from me, is just to check in on that tax rate, kind of where you see in '24 where we settle in?\nRon Copher: Yes, Ron here. The settle in, it will range from 18% to 18.5% somewhere in that ballpark is the, we achieve the net interest income, the NIM, all of that occurring as well.\nJeff Rulis: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon King with Truist. Your line is now open.\nBrandon King: Hi, good morning.\nRandy Chesler: Good morning, Brandon.\nBrandon King: So could you quantify the amount of loans, fixed rate and adjustable rate loans you expect to reprice in 2024 and what the runoff yields are?\nRandy Chesler: The answer is, we're going to have to check on that for you, Brandon.\nBrandon King: Okay.\nRandy Chesler: So let us get back to you with the exact numbers. We do - that was one thing I was going to add to the margin discussion. We do continue to get some lift with portfolio repricing. It's a lag repricing. And so, there is some lift there and it is accelerating into '25, but we'll get to the actual numbers.\nBrandon King: Okay. And then on the CDs, if I remember correctly, was what I heard, 60% mature in the first quarter. And I wanted to know what rates those CDs are coming off that, and what you're looking to reprice those CDs at?\nByron Pollan: Sure, those CDs are priced at a little under 4.5%. And it will depend on the rate environment, when those CDs come up for maturity. But we're already starting to test, kind of peeling back those renewal rates a little bit, and we're having good success there. So, I would expect the renewal of those CDs to come in, just a little bit below where they are.\nBrandon King: Okay. That's helpful. And then lastly, with the CFPB proposal and overdraft fees, are you considering any proactive changes to your overdraft policy?\nRandy Chesler: No, we're watching that carefully and looking at it. At this point in time, we don't anticipate any changes. I think it's still early. So, there's a lot of discussion to be had about that. If you read the full report, pretty extensive. The industry is got a very strong point of view. So at this point, we're watching the discussion and too early to really anticipate any changes.\nBrandon King: Okay. That's all I had. Thanks for taking my questions.\nRandy Chesler: Welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Terrell with Stephens. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Terrell: Hi, good morning.\nRandy Chesler: Good morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Terrell: Maybe just to start, Byron, I appreciate all the commentary you gave earlier on the deposit side. It was helpful. I just want to clarify, when you discuss kind of year-on-year, '24 versus '23 deposit balance is kind of flat on the year. Is that inclusive or exclusive of Wheatland?\nByron Pollan: That is exclusive of Wheatland. So that would be - the organic trajectory of our deposit base.\nAndrew Terrell: Yes. Okay. I thought so, just wanted to make sure there. And then if I could clarify, Ron, on the - just to go back to the core expense guide. So, before the Wheatland deal, you're talking to kind of a $138 million to $140 million core expense in 1Q. So call it even a pretty significant build from the 4Q, even if you normalize for the $6 million that sound like a true-up benefit this quarter. I guess I'm struggling to figure out how you get from what I call like a $132 million core in 4Q up to $138 million to $140 million on a core basis in the first quarter. Just given some of the expense commentary, it sounds pretty positive. And you had some FTE reduction in the fourth quarter. It sounds like a lot of expense management focus. I guess I'm just struggling to figure out how we get from $132 million to $138 million to $140 million?\nRon Copher: Yes, certainly a good chunk of that is the mere increase, talent costs. And so, layered in a 5% increase. So, we're still seeing higher inflation out there. And so just being conservative, but still very comfortable with the $138 million to $140 million. And the team, the colleagues, everybody's looking at it, but we continue to have - negotiate and see 5% absolutely could happen, no doubt about it.\nAndrew Terrell: Yes. Okay. Got it. And then if I could just clarify one point on the margin guidance that you guys provided that the $280 million to $290 million range for the full year, inclusive of, it sounds like three cuts in the last three quarters of the year. I guess if the margin, the commentary for the NIM into 1Q is a pretty stable level versus the fourth quarter. And then maybe some inflection in 2Q, but then building in the back half of the year as you get the benefit of those cuts, it kind of implies you got to move to like a 3% plus NIM exiting the year. Is that kind of a fair assessment, or would you walk that back a little bit?\nRon Copher: That's a fair assessment.\nAndrew Terrell: Okay. Well, thanks for taking the questions this morning. I appreciate it.\nRandy Chesler: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. And I'm currently showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the conference back to Mr. Randy Chesler for closing remarks.\nRandy Chesler: Right, well, thank you, Norma. Thank you everyone for joining us this morning. And that - concludes our call. So, we appreciate everyone taking time out of your busy day to listen in. Have a great Friday and a great weekend.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. You may now disconnect.

Chris?\nChristopher Donahue: Thank you, Ray, and good morning all. I will review Federated Hermes business performance and Tom will comment on the financial results. We had solid asset growth in Q4, ending with record assets under management of $758 billion, driven by record money market assets of $560 billion. Now looking first at equities, assets were up about $2 billion from Q3 to $79.3 billion, due to combined market gains and FX impact of $6.7 billion, but partially offset by net redemptions of $4.7 billion. We did see Q4 positive net sales in 11 equity strategies, including MDT Large Cap Growth, MDT Mid-Cap Growth, and international small-mid funds. Looking at our equity fund performance compared to peers and using Morningstar data for the trailing three years at the end of the year, 48% of our equity funds were beating peers, and 24% were in the top quartile in their category. For the first three weeks of Q1, combined equity funds and SMAs had net redemptions of $319 million. Now turning to fixed income, assets increased by about $5.1 billion in Q4 to $94.9 billion, with fixed income separate accounts reaching a record high of $51 billion. Fixed income institutional separate accounts had net sales of $1.4 billion, led by corporates, multi-sector, and multi-sector. Fixed income SMAs had Q4 gross sales and net sales of $896 million and $584 million, respectively. Fixed income funds had net redemptions of about $988 million in Q4 and have had slightly positive net sales for the first three weeks of January. We had 12 fixed income funds with positive net sales in the fourth quarter, including the High Yield Bond Collective Investment Trust and the Sterling Cash Plus Fund. We launched an actively managed ETF in the fourth quarter that uses a process similar to the core strategy of our Total Return Bond Fund. Regarding performance at the end of 2023 and using Morningstar data for the trailing three years, 31% of our fixed income funds were beating peers and 11% were in the top quartile of their category. For the first three weeks of Q1, combined, fixed income funds and SMAs had net sales of $105 million. In the alternative and private markets category, assets increased by $214 million in Q4 from the prior quarter to $20.6 billion due mainly to positive FX impact partially offset by market decreases. We are in the market with Horizon 3, the third vintage of our Horizon series of Global Private Equity Funds. As previously announced, Horizon 3 has closed on commitments of $100.05 billion through year end. Hermes Innovation Fund II is also in the market. This is the second vintage of our pan-European growth private equity innovation fund. We had our first close in 2003 in August for approximately \u20ac100 million. And we're also in the market with the first vintage of our U.K. Nature Impact Fund. We began 2024 with about $3.1 billion in net institutional mandates yet to fund into both funds and separate accounts. These wins are diversified across fixed income, equity and private markets. About $1.9 billion of net total wins is expected to come into private market strategies, including private equity, direct lending and unconstrained credit. Fixed income expected net additions total about $850 million with wins in the ultra-short, short duration, high yield and sustainable investment credit. About $340 million of the net total wins is expected to come into equity strategies, including bio equity, global equity, GEMS which is the emerging markets ideas, and MDT Small Cap Core. Moving to money markets. We recently marked 50 years of innovation and successful management of money market funds as we launched the first fund to ever use the term money market on January 16th of 1974. At year-end 2023, we reached record highs for money market fund assets of $406 billion. Money market separate account assets of $154 billion and total money market assets of $560 billion. Total money market assets increased by $83 billion or 17% during 2003 and by $35 billion or 7% in the fourth quarter. Money market strategies continue to benefit from favorable market conditions for cash as an asset class, elevated liquidity levels in the financial system and attractive yields compared to cash management alternatives such as bank deposits and more recently direct investments in money market instruments such as T-bills and commercial paper. In the expected upcoming period of declining short term rates, we believe that market conditions for money market strategies will continue to be favorable compared to direct market rates and bank deposit rates. Our estimate of money market mutual fund market share which includes sub-advised funds was about 7.4% at the end of 2023 up from about 7.3% at the end of the third quarter last year. Now, looking at recent asset totals as of a few days ago, managed assets were approximately $764 billion, including $568 billion in money markets, $78 billion in equities, $95 billion in fixed income, $20 billion in alternative private markets, and $3 billion in multi-asset. Money market mutual fund assets were at $406 billion. Tom?\nThomas Donahue: Thanks, Chris. Total revenue for Q4 decreased $11.2 million from the prior quarter, due mainly to lower average equity assets and lower total carried interest and performance fees. This is partially offset by higher average money market assets. Total Q4 carried interest and performance fees were $9.7 million, compared to $14.9 million in Q3. Q4 operating expenses decreased by $12.3 million from the prior quarter, due mainly to lower compensation expense related to carried interest in consolidated vehicles and lower incentive compensation expense. Advertising expense increased in Q4, due to the launch of our new campaign. The other operating expense line item decreased mainly due to the impact of FX. Looking ahead to Q1, certain seasonal factors will impact results. The impact of fewer days is expected to result in about $4 million in lower operating income, all else being equal. In addition, based on our early assessment, compensation and related expense is expected to be higher than Q4, primarily to about $8 million of seasonally higher expense for stock compensation, payroll taxes, and base pay increases. We also expect to have higher incentive compensation expense. Of course, all these items will vary based on multiple factors. Holly, we would like to now open the call up for questions.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] One moment, please, while we poll for questions. Your first question for today is coming from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM).\nKen Worthington: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe starting particularly high level for you, Chris. I would like to ask you about strategy over the next three to five years. So maybe starting, what are the top two or three goals you have for the company? And then can you talk about your expectations for some of the businesses? In particular, I'm curious about what your goal is for the ESG franchise and the strategy there, and then the outlook and goals for the money market fund and the alternatives business.\nChristopher Donahue: Okay. Let's go in reverse. On the ESG, we're doing more work in order to tag various ESG features to actual financial information and financial statements. This is not ready for prime time, but it's a way to show the fluency that we have on this subject and further defend the integration of ESG concepts into the various funds where these features have been integrated as part of the risk-reward analysis. And we continue with that unabated. We also continue in the European spector to do what the clients want, which is to have sustainable funds that are going on beyond the regular fiduciary duty concepts that we have here in the U.S. So we are remaining where we were on that. We also believe that this will very much help on the risk-reward analysis across the board. So we continue to go forward with that. On the money market funds, remember that over 50 years, we have had the strategy of keeping the money funds alive and well, and they work on the basis of higher highs and higher lows over all that time frame. And our dedication to it in terms of arguing with the SEC, dealing with the realities of the marketplace, have been well rewarded. These money market funds into the future will continue to serve as ballast for the ship of FHI, which it has done to date, noting that when there are variations in the marketplace, the money market funds prove the viability of a differentiated franchise for all seasons, and we continue to maintain that. And don't forget that as the money supply is now back up, that is really the engine of monies going into money funds. So we think that it is a permanent good long-term business. And in terms of top goals for various enterprises, the one way to look at the way we internally view growth in various spheres is simply double them all in five years. Now, that's not going to happen on the money funds, but it's certainly what we would establish as the goals for fixed income equity and especially private markets. And as I said to this group before, the private markets has the potential to be bigger than the fixed income and equity enterprise that we already manage here. And we have a lot of good things going on that side of the business. Now, mind you, it's less than $20 billion, but nonetheless, they have all good records. The real estate is excellent. The private equity is excellent. The private credit is excellent. And we're working on the infrastructure deal. Now, there are other structures that we have to get right. And those are we like to provide the investment management. We are indifferent as to what the structure is. So now you see me mentioning about the ETF for total return bond fund. We have some more plans to add another handful onto our ETF offerings. And the idea is to make a full complement of ETF offerings as we go forward. And that will be a big move for us in the future. Don't forget, these are active ETFs. And the active ETFs are only about 6% of the total ETF market. So we think there's plenty of room to grow in those areas. I'm sure I skipped some of the other great goals that we have. But don't forget, we're spending tons of money on technology. And to not have goals on getting that right would be a mistake.\nKen Worthington: Great. Thank you. And then maybe for Debbie, Chris called out the attractive yield and money market funds versus direct markets. So can you talk about the dynamics here and impact of PPP, QT, and the pivot, and what that sort of has on the outlook for the money market business?\nDeborah Cunningham: Sure. I think what it does mostly is take the direction of flows and increase it more towards the institutional side. Doesn't take away the retail side that has certainly been the driver of the flows in 2022 and 2023. But I think it emphasizes more the institutional side. And that is because in the context of what's been happening from a pivot perspective with the yield curve itself, as well as expectations from a QT standpoint, you've seen what has been over the course of the last 18 months a fairly steep money market yield curve turn into something that's relatively flat from a prime perspective and relatively inverted from two months out on the government side. And ultimately, that means that the institutional buyer of cash securities, of cash in some way, is going to go out of the securities market where they've been for the last 18 months and into something that holds on to the yield a little bit longer. And that would, in most instances, be money market funds. So our outlook is very positive with regard to flows and somewhat of a shift that occurs based on 2022 and 2023 being mostly retail into institutional coming a lot from the 2024 being institutionally driven.\nKen Worthington: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Adam Beatty with UBS.\nAdam Beatty: Thank you and good morning. Just wanted to follow up on your most recent comments and get some additional thoughts around retail behavior. Obviously, strong flows over the year as rates have gone up, but I'm still seeing articles in the press about folks with \u201chigh yield\u201d savings accounts that are paying 10 or 20 bips. That suggests maybe more retail inertia than some might have supposed. I just wanted to get your thoughts around how long a tail, how much of a time lag there might be with continuing inflows in retail and maybe even strengthening. And then on the backside of maybe some rate cuts, how sticky that money might be in your money market funds. Thank you.\nDeborah Cunningham: Sure. And let me just start with a little bit of a history lesson. If you go back prior to the financial problems in 2008, deposits at that point were in the little over $8 trillion area. They ran up to something that was close to 20 trillion, just under 20 trillion during the zero rate environment that started from a 2008 standpoint and then really continued through the pandemic with just a year and a half or so, 2016 and 17 of higher rates. So ultimately, deposit products doubled not because of the attractiveness of the yield, but because there really wasn't any yield in the marketplace. And the concern was from a safety perspective, they thought retail trades went into deposits in that environment. What you've seen over the course of the last year and a half has been a small reversal of that, which is why I'm not saying that the retail trade is done. Certainly, it's not surprising that with money funds increasing 1.2 trillion in the past year, deposits are decreasing 1 trillion, that those two numbers are equitable. Having said that, there's still 17 trillion left in deposits out there, many of which, as you note, are in the 10, 20, 30 basis point camp from a payment perspective. So the expectations would be that that trade continues. Certainly, when you look at deposit betas from a banking perspective for their deposit products, they have been loath to increase with markets as rates are increasing, but have been very quick to decrease. Now I'm not sure that that will be the case at this point in this scenario, given that they haven't gone up very far to begin with, but in all cases, I think the retail trade has been awakened and it will continue. I think it will be matched basically by the institutional trade in 2024, but certainly will be a factor that continues to contribute to the flows in this market.\nAdam Beatty: That's a great perspective. Thank you, Debbie. I just want to turn to compensation, particularly around incentives. Tom gave some guidance around 1Q and the step up there, but just wanted a reminder on what drives incentive comp. Recently we've had pretty strong markets, obviously very strong asset growth in the money market funds and separate accounts, but also some outflows in some of the long-term funds. So if you could just put some context around what really drives incentive comp. Thank you.\nThomas Donahue: Adam, of course, we recalibrate for the year. And I did say we expect that incentive comp line to go up for the year. And to kind of break it down, in the sales group, they are paid based on how sales go. In the investment management side of things, they're primarily compensated on performance. And then, the operation side is on how well the company does. So we expect to continue to grow. We expect pretty good sales, and we're expecting the investment performance to uptick. So that's why I come in and we expect the company earnings to grow. So that's why I'm saying I expect the comp to go up.\nAdam Beatty: Got it. Appreciate it. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Bill Katz with TD Cowen.\nWilliam Katz: Great. Thank you very much. Just a couple of questions this morning. First of all, thank you for taking the question. Just to push back a little bit on sort of the money market dynamic, how sticky is the benefit to the institutional argument if ultimately the Fed funds does go down, follows the path, and you get equilibrium between the T-bill or direct market and money markets, let's say, a year from now? So is this more transitory in scope or do you think that there are higher highs here just given the structure of the market?\nChristopher Donahue: Well Bill, first of all, welcome back. And my answer to that is higher highs and higher lows. And Debbie is closer to the market on that, and I'll let her comment.\nDeborah Cunningham: Certainly, Bill. How sticky? I think very sticky. Ultimately, institutional investors generally have more options than the retail investor does. But once a trend is begun given what market, in response to what market conditions are, it stays for a while. So in what I'll call flat to inverted or declining rate environment, you're going to see institutional investors in a product that has more duration associated with it. Now, institutional investors in the zero percent rate environment ultimately became more, more measured about how their cash was put into play in the market. They created buckets essentially from a cash perspective operating cash, which is very short-term overnight type needs. And then what would be strategic cash and core cash, depending upon transactions and maybe longer-term needs of their firms. And ultimately, in a declining and stable environment, almost all of that cash becomes part of the sort of the money market franchise. It's only when you start to see interest rates start to go back up that it becomes a little bit more transitory in the context of strategic and operating, trying to capture those higher yields for a longer, or the yields for a longer period of time. So it's ultimately something that, we've kind of seen as a trend in the flows over time and expect it. In the last rising rate environment of 16, 17, and 18, we saw that, we saw it similarly change on the decline during COVID. But our expectations are that there's nothing really that drives it. There's no different products in the marketplace that would drive different dynamics in this current cycle.\nWilliam Katz: Okay, thank you. And Chris, thanks for the well wishes. Good to be back. Just one follow-up. I don't know if it's for Saker or for Tom. Just sort of wondering, as your private markets business continues to get a bit larger and you are building some more performance fees and/or carry opportunities, is there a way to help us understand how much you have in terms of carry eligible AUM or how to think about trying to monitor or track for performance fees? It's becoming a bigger number, and it's not that much transparency versus some of your peers. I was wondering if you could help us triangulate how to think that through. Thank you.\nChristopher Donahue: Yes, it's, yes, we, I understand your dilemma there. We've tried to give out the numbers in the past, and we know that we cannot predict it. And we've kind of said, hey, here's the range of what the performance fees has been over the past. And we're willing to do that again. We're just not willing to go out and say how much is going to come each quarter or for the year. So I'm not really giving you much guidance there. Is Saker on? Saker, I don't know if you have a follow-up to my non-answer.\nSaker Nusseibeh: So no, other than to reiterate what you just said, Tom, and maybe to kind of explain, the other difference about our private markets business is we're building a very diversified private markets business which makes us different. So we carry performance fees from our private equity. And, yes, that's comparable to other private equity players, for example. But if you take our real estate where we also have performance fees that is varied. Some of it has to do with renting out the buildings when we finish place making. Some has to do with achieving targets. And in other strategies, we have also similar performance fees. So I'm afraid it's not much help. The only thing we can say to you is, here are the historical numbers. You can look at what they look like. We can't predict whether we win performance fees over time or not, that is not right and proper. But look at our track record. And then we're growing our private market business which implies a future growth. Obviously, assuming that we hit our performance target, which is something we can't guarantee. So I'm afraid not much help other than to tell you it's just the nature of our business.\nWilliam Katz: Okay, well I tried. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Kenneth Lee with RBC Capital Markets.\nKenneth Lee: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. In terms of the equity outflows in the quarter, was there anything to call out there, any changes in mandates that you saw? Thanks.\nChristopher Donahue: One comment I would make on those, if you just -- it's getting less worse, let's put it that way. And the way I would phrase that is that if you look at the strategic value dividend fund, and sure, there were pretty good sizable redemptions for the whole year. In October, it were about negative 350. In November, they were negative 280. In December, they were negative 250. And so far this year, they're negative about 30 or 35 this month. And so it's declining. What's going on there? Well, what's going on there is that some of the clientele is wanting to go out into the market more, a little more risk on. And they see the beauty of a product that does just what it says, namely a dividend product with growth of dividend. And the people who are selling it understand that that's what it is. So that's one observation that I would make.\nKenneth Lee: Got you. Very helpful there. And just one follow-up, if I may. Given the meaningful share repurchases in the quarter, wondering if you could just give any updated thoughts around outlook for potential M&A acquisitions, especially in this environment. Thanks.\nThomas Donahue: Yes, Ken. It's Tom. Yes, we bought shares, and we continue to think that we will be active doing that. In terms of M&A, we have our group out there active, and they're working on some different things. We're always interested in the roll-ups. We're interested in money funds. We're looking a little more actively in Europe, as maybe we'll be able to buy some roll-up type things there. And then, as we've talked before, in the private markets, we've put some efforts in to see what we can purchase in the U.S. to complement our U.K. team. And there's nothing to announce or talk about specifically, though.\nKenneth Lee: Got you. Very helpful there. Thanks again.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.\nDaniel Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. One more question just on the alts business and the backlog, I think, was around $1.9 billion that you mentioned. Can you give us a expectation of what's a reasonable time to see that fund and/or show up as a flow? And then what is the kind of average fee rate of that backlog?\nRaymond Hanley: Yes, Dan, the private markets money has a longer runway than the other wins that we talked about. So that's really will take up to two years to fund and be fee earnings. And that's typically we get commitments. And then depending on the strategy when the money is actually drawn down and investing, that's when it would become an actual flow, move out of the pipeline, move into the flow numbers when it becomes fee earning, but that typically happens over longer time frames. Equity and fixed income are more a couple of quarters the private market is out a year or two.\nChristopher Donahue: And the private markets part of that $1.9 billion is about half. And a bunch of the other is direct lending and unconstrained credit, and that comes in faster. And maybe Saker has a timing on that that would be more illuminating.\nSaker Nusseibeh: So the difference -- thank you, Chris, the difference is things like direct lending and so on, we'd expect to come in within two quarters normally, if it's been committed. And we -- as soon as we have it in, we start drawing it down and investing. And that is different, as you've heard from things like private equity, whether it's Horizon or private equity growth, which is a longer time horizon. When we do, and we haven't announced any at this stage, when we do large real estate deals, fun enough that does tend to take about a year as well. So that's the best guidance that I can give at this stage. But direct lending is certainly quite fast and so is a good straight lending.\nDaniel Fannon: And the average fee rate of that backlog roughly?\nChristopher Donahue: It varies. Go ahead. Go ahead, Saker.\nSaker Nusseibeh: No, no, I was going to exactly the same. So it varies on the strategy, and it's very hard to give -- and I know you guys like guidance and so on. But it is very hard to give because it varies on the strategy. The private equity strategy where we pick up private equity with the base fee and then a percentage of the performance fees, for example, other strategies would have different kinds of structures, performance fees and different kind of base fees. So I'm afraid, because our alternative or private market business is still very it's very difficult to give a singular number like you do for equities or fixed income. It just depends from strategy to strategy.\nDaniel Fannon: Okay. And then just as a quick follow-up, Tom, the ad campaign that drove 4Q a bit higher. Is that an ongoing or what's a reasonable run rate for ad spend in 2024?\nThomas Donahue: Dan. I'd look at the whole year of 2023 as the guidance, and then I expect we're going to do more than 2023, but I would use Q4 as a run rate. I take the whole 2023 and divide it up and when exactly we're going to run the campaigns we're still working on. But I'd add a little bit to 2023s number.\nDaniel Fannon: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks good morning folks. Thanks for all the answers to these questions. It's pretty interesting. A couple expansions from prior comments. So maybe Debbie will start with the money market fund side. Just again, a great color on the dynamics there. But do you have a sense of what the addressable market might be for Federated inflows into money market funds coming from things like T-bills. And should we be thinking of the -- in 2019 into 2020 as a general proxy for that? Or do you think the addressable market is larger now and we could see better inflows?\nDeborah Cunningham: I think on a percentage basis, using the 2016 to 2019 time frame and the experience there is probably a good one. Obviously, that goes up with the markets increase. But on a percentage basis, sort of in the high teens, I think that's probably something that we're expecting, let's say.\nBrian Bedell: Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then just back on the private markets, triangulating some answers back to Chris' first answer and Saker's, a couple of answers on this. In terms of -- just if you think about infrastructure and energy transition, and I know you obviously have the infrastructure fund and the U.K. nature-based fund as well. But the market for these particular assets are growing very substantially, and you've got a great brand name and good track record. I guess what's your view on really scaling that up is kind of dramatically more than you are now? Is it a capacity constraint? Do you need to acquire more teams -- or do you feel like you have the infrastructure in place and it's something that you can really start launching funds on and going after that market more dramatically?\nChristopher Donahue: I'll take a swing at the pitch first and then Saker will follow up. When we originally bought the Hermes enterprise, there was a lot of work that needed to be done in order to gain proper control of all of those private market entities and all the structures. The next thing that needed to be done was we needed to make it a viable open market type operation. Generally, in the old days, it was a single client. And if the client called, you answered the question. And it wasn't a platform for doing things. So over the last couple of years, we have been working on those two things that had to get right. And we're still working on some of the things on the infrastructure in particular on those subjects. So there's internal things that have to happen. The next thing that happens, as I say, we're in the market, its repeat the sounding joy of sales -- and we had a great sales conference in London in person. Last week, we have our global sales conference coming up next week coming out of Pittsburgh. It will be virtual. But the point is that it's now time for the sales to take over and play core [ph] in the marketplace. And I'll let Saker make some comments as well.\nSaker Nusseibeh: Thank you, Chris. So to add to what Chris just said, we were doing some work, particularly on the infrastructure side, which we hope to finish and we're in the marketplace. Nature is a new endeavor where we are seen as very much the innovators, and we're hoping for more sales with that. Now what I would say in general about the old Hermes franchise is as follows, which is everything we did because we thought we could enhance returns not just because it was trendy or it was the theme of the moment. And that is true of the transition. So we are very much involved in looking at ways that we could invest in the whole theme of energy transition across the board in various ways and in various strategies, not just private markets and benefit our clients in the process. The difference is when we do something, we do it right, we kind of go fast slow if that makes sense to you in this sense, which is we make sure that we're in the right place. And going back to something that Chris said right at the beginning of the call, I think what differentiates us as an enterprise from others, not everybody, but I think it's a differentiator is that the way that we approach whether it's integrating ESG for risk return profile, whether it's thinking about thematic funds, whether it's launching the nature fund that we've launched, we do so thoughtfully, and I think with stronger foundations because we believe the strong foundations will bring the rewards and the sales will happen. And this is the time when we hope to start rewarding single awards.\nBrian Bedell: And do you feel you have the internal capacity to execute that strategy right now? Or do you think bolt-on M&A would accelerate that?\nChristopher Donahue: Well let's put the question this way first. We have the toys to do it right now. We would love some bolt-ons. Tom has talked before about how we could accelerate the real estate efforts, place buildings, Saker mentioned it on this call already as a viable thing in the United States. But we're not hard to throw on something like that right now, we would love to do it. So yes, bolt-ons would be good, but they are mutually exclusive. Just because you're looking for a bolt-on or would do it doesn't mean that you don't have the toys to be able to get to the future anyway.\nBrian Bedell: Okay. Great, fair enough. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from John Dunn with Evercore.\nJohn Dunn: Thank you. For the fixed income franchise, how do you think that the next phase of the rates picture affects you guys? It seems like you should be beneficiary. What are like the big puts and takes for the major product areas?\nChristopher Donahue: Well, there are several there. I'm going to start off with Munis. And the record here in terms of the performance of both the funds and the SMAs has been excellent. And we're seeing increased interest there, including in CW Henderson in terms of them growing assets under management. So as people look for bigger yield, that's one place to go. In other places, our core strategy. Obviously, total return bond fund and the core SMAs where the records are simply outstanding. And that's why we did the ETF with that type of strategy. Sooner or later, the excellent history and our opportunistic high-yield gets more and more visibility. It's all a question now of which companies you own and whether you own the ones that are having a lot of trouble refinancing, and we think we do a good job on the credit analysis there. So if you then say, okay, well what about across the spectrum of maturities and you look at it, you got money funds and Microshorts, the Ultrashorts, the intermediates, all the way out the spectrum, we have reliable, solid product that when people want to really gauge and ladder their fixed income approach, we have the answers, and we are very helpful to them when they want to do that. So the fixed income franchise is very strong, and I think very, very well set up for the future.\nJohn Dunn: Got you. And then as we seem to be going into a more normal environment over the course of 2024, what's kind of the outlook for Hermes strategy specifically, both in the U.S. and the U.K. and retail and institutional?\nChristopher Donahue: I'll let Saker take a swing at that one.\nSaker Nusseibeh: So if you break it down. In our equity franchise in the U.K., we have a large exposure to emerging markets. That's an exposure that's been somewhat out of favor, as you know, if you look at the performance of -- the emerging markets, particularly China versus the rest of the world, it tells you why. We have two kinds of strategies there. One is an outstanding over the strategy, which we have we're running here and another one by a separate team, which is one of the best performing value strategies. Now our contention is at some stage, things get so attractively valued that they will see some more inflows. And as we see more inflows this year come back to, particularly with the general environment worldwide, we would imagine that asset allocators would put more assets into those strategies. We have other equity franchises, the thematic funds of biodiversity, the impact and so on, and we would expect people to continue to want to allocate them. If you look at our fixed income, our teams continue to see good demand, as you've seen from our release, and we expect that flows to continue. So I'm happy with that and direct lending we've already covered. And we've already talked about the pipeline, which is very strong in our alternative market franchises. So none of this is a prediction, obviously, because you can't predict, but that's how I would imagine the market to behave as we move forward in this market environment because of the tough market environment for the last couple of years.\nJohn Dunn: Thanks very much.\nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I will now turn the call over to Ray Hanley for closing remarks.\nRaymond Hanley: Thank you, Holly, and that concludes our call. We thank you for joining us today.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor. For more information see our T&C."

I would now like to welcome Scott Crawley, Corporate Controller to begin the call. Scott, over to you.\nScott Crawley: Thank you, Mondy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss First Financial Bancorp's fourth quarter and full-year 2023 financial results. Participating on today's call will be Archie Brown, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jamie Anderson, Chief Financial Officer; and Bill Harrod, Chief Credit Officer. Both the press release we issued yesterday and the accompanying slide presentation that are available on our website at www.bankatfirst.com under the Investor Relations section. We'll make reference to the slides contained in the accompanying presentation during today's call. Additionally, please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure contained in the fourth quarter 2023 earnings release, as well as our SEC filings for a full discussion of the company's risk factors. The information we'll provide today is accurate as of December 31, 2023, and we will not be updating any forward-looking statements to reflect facts or circumstances after this call. I'll now turn the call over to Archie Brown.\nArchie Brown: Thank you, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. Yesterday afternoon, we announced our financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2023. Before I turn the call over to Jamie, I'd like to provide some highlights from the most recent quarter and recap this year's record performance. I'm very pleased with our fourth quarter performance, adjusted earnings per share was $0.62, which resulted in a return on assets of 1.37% and a return on tangible common equity ratio of 22.2%. As expected, rising funding costs outpaced the increase in asset yields. However, our net interest margin remained very strong at 4.26%. Additionally, balance sheet trends were positive during the quarter with loans increasing $286 million or 11% on an annualized basis, and average deposits increasing $416 million or 13% on an annualized basis. Non-interest income and expenses were both lower than we expected during the quarter. The decline in non-interest income included a $4.6 million loss on a trade at Bannockburn. However, excluding this loss, foreign exchange income was within our range of expectations. Leasing income also declined during the period due to lower end of term fees and lease origination shifting to a greater mix of finance leases. The partnership increased interest income and the net interest margin. It resulted in lower non-interest income during the period. Non-interest expenses declined for the quarter primarily due to lower incentive compensation, which is tied directly to non-interest income. Asset quality was stable for the quarter with underlying credit trends improving. Net charge-offs were 46 basis points during the quarter, and were driven by one relationship that included a borrower fraud. This loan had been on non-accrual for most of the year and was almost fully reserved coming into the fourth quarter. Additionally, non-forming assets declined by 12% to 38 basis points and classified asset balances were relatively unchanged from the third quarter. 2023 was a record year for First Financial. Adjusted earnings per share increased 17% from the prior year to $2.77, while return on assets was 1.55%, return on tangible common equity was 25.4% and our efficiency ratio was 56%. Total revenue of $840.2 million was the highest in the company's history, increasing 18.5% over the prior year. Our balance sheet responded favorably to the interest rate and environment resulting in a 21% in net interest income. Additionally, record years from wealth management and Summit drove a 12% increase in non-interest income. We're extremely pleased with the performance of our balance sheet during 2023, especially given the turmoil in the banking industry in the first half of the year. Loan production was solid exceeding 6% in balance growth, while average deposit balances increased 2.4% compared to the prior year. We're also very happy with the 122 basis point expansion in the tangible common equity ratio and 24% increase in the tangible book value per share for the year. Asset quality trends were a bit elevated during the year. Net charge-off increased to 33 basis points for 2023 after we achieved a record low of 6 basis points in 2022. This increase was driven by two large relationships as well as the loss on the sale of a small portfolio of ICRE loans. Non-performing assets to total assets into the year at 38 basis points, we believe we\u2019re well positioned to manage the coming year and we're cautiously optimistic regarding asset quality in 2024. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jamie to discuss these results in greater detail. After Jamie's discussion, I'll wrap up with some additional forward-looking commentary and closing remarks.\nJamie Anderson: Thank you, Archie, and good morning, everyone. Slides 4, 5, and 6 provide a summary of our fourth quarter financial results. The fourth quarter was another good quarter highlighted by strong earnings, net interest margin that exceeded expectations, stable asset quality metrics, and solid loan and deposit growth. Our balance sheet continues to respond favorably to the current interest rate environment. While our net interest margin declined slightly, the pace was less than we expected and remains very strong at 4.26%. We anticipate further net interest margin contraction in the coming periods due to additional pressure on deposit pricing and changes in funding mix. Total loans grew 11% on an annualized basis, which exceeded our expectations. Loan growth was concentrated in the leasing, specialty finance, investor CRE, and residential mortgage books with relatively stable balances in the other portfolios. Non-interest income declined in the fourth quarter. The largest decline was foreign exchange, which was negatively impacted by a $4.6 million loss on a trade. However, this loss was mostly offset by lower non-interest expenses. Additionally, leasing business income declined during the quarter. However, this was primarily a function of product mix, a summit originated a larger volume of finance leases during the period. Non-interest expenses declined from the linked quarter due to lower employee costs and marketing expenses. Overall, asset quality trends were stable with lower net charge-offs, flat classified assets and declining non-performing asset balances. Annualized net charge-offs were 46 basis points during the period and were driven by a single $9 million relationship that we previously reserved for. We recorded $10.2 million of provision expense during the period, which was driven by net charge-offs and loan growth. Our ACL coverage remains conservative at 1.29% of total loans. From a capital standpoint, our regulatory ratios remain in excess of both internal and regulatory targets. Accumulated other comprehensive income improved $100 million during the period. As a result, tangible book value increased 13.5%, while our tangible common equity ratio increased by 67 basis points during the period. Slide 7 reconciles our GAAP earnings to adjusted earnings, highlighting items that we believe are important to understanding our quarterly performance. Adjusted net income was $59 million or $0.62 per share for the quarter. Adjusted earnings exclude the impact of the FDIC special assessment as well as costs not expected to recur, such as acquisition, severance and branch consolidation costs. As depicted on Slide 8, these adjusted earnings equate to a return on average assets of 1.37%, a return on average tangible common equity of 22% and an efficiency ratio of 58%. Turning to Slide 9. Net interest margin declined 7 basis points from the linked quarter to 4.26%. As we expected, higher funding costs outpaced the increase in asset yields. Primarily due to a 31 basis point increase in the cost of deposits. These costs were partially offset by a favorable shift in funding mix and a 14 basis point increase in asset yields due to higher rates and a more profitable mix of earning asset balances during the period. On Slide 10, you can see the increase in asset yields included an 11 basis point increase in loan yields. Additionally, the yield on the investment portfolio increased 13 basis points. As I previously mentioned, our cost of deposits increased 31 basis points compared to the linked quarter, and we expect these costs to continue to increase in the first quarter but at a slower pace than we saw in the fourth quarter. Slide 11 details the betas utilized in our net interest income modeling. Deposit costs increased with greater velocity in the fourth quarter, moving our current beta up 5 percentage points to 38%. Our modeling indicates that our through-the-cycle beta is approximately 40%. Slide 12 outlines our various sources of liquidity and borrowing capacity. We continue to believe we have the flexibility required to manage the balance sheet through the expected economic environment. Slide 13 illustrates our current loan mix and balance changes compared to the linked quarter. As I mentioned before, loan balances increased 11% on an annualized basis, with broad-based growth. Summit, specialty finance, ICRE and mortgage, all had strong quarters while the other loan portfolios were relatively flat. Slide 14 provides detail on our loan concentration by industry. We believe our loan portfolio remains sufficiently diversified to provide protection from deterioration in any particular industry. Slide 15 provides detail on our office portfolio. About 4% of our total loan book is concentrated in office space, and the overall LTV of the portfolio is strong. No office relationships were downgraded during the quarter, and our total nonaccrual balance for this portfolio declined to $23 million. Slide 12 shows our deposit mix as well as the progression of average deposits from the linked quarter. In total, average deposit balances increased $416 million during the quarter, driven primarily by a $284 million increase in money market accounts and $123 million increase in public funds and a $158 million increase in combined retail and brokered CDs. These increases offset a decline in noninterest-bearing deposits and savings accounts. This was expected as the current interest rate environment has driven customers to higher-cost deposit products. Slide 17 illustrates trends in our average personal, business and public fund deposits as well as the comparison of our borrowing capacity to our uninsured deposits. We saw increases in all three deposit types. With personal deposits increasing $97 million, business deposits increasing $124 million and public fund balances increasing $123 million. On the bottom right of the slide, you can see our adjusted uninsured deposits were $3.2 billion at the end of the year. This equates to 24% of our total deposits. We are comfortable with this concentration and believe our borrowing capacity provides sufficient flexibility to respond to any event that would stress our larger deposit balances. Slide 18 highlights our non-interest income for the quarter. Fee income declined to $47 million during the fourth quarter. The biggest driver of the decline was lower foreign exchange income which was negatively impacted by a $4.6 million loss on a trade. This loss was offset by a reduction in the related employee costs and non-interest expenses. Leasing business income declined during the period due to a heavier mix of finance lease originations during the period. Additionally, wealth management had another solid quarter and other non-interest income increased during the period, driven by higher syndication fees. Non-interest expense for the quarter is outlined on Slide 19. Core expenses declined $4.7 million during the period. This decrease was driven by lower employee costs, which are tied to fee income as well as lower marketing expenses. Turning now to Slides 20 and 21. Our ACL model resulted in a total allowance, which includes both funded and unfunded reserves of $160 million and $10.2 million of total provision expense during the period. This resulted in an ACL that was 1.29% of loans, which was a 7 basis point decrease from the third quarter. Provision expense was driven by net charge-offs and loan growth. Net charge-offs were $12.6 million or 46 basis points on an annualized basis and were primarily driven by a $9 million relationship that had been previously reserved for. In other credit trends, non-accrual loans decreased during the period due to the charge-off I previously mentioned, while classified asset balances were relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. Our ACL coverage was 1.29% at year-end. As I mentioned last quarter, we have modeled conservatively in prior quarters to build a reserve that reflected the losses we expect from our portfolio. We expect our ACL coverage to remain relatively flat in the coming periods. Finally, as shown on Slides 22, 23 and 24, regulatory capital ratios remain in excess of regulatory minimums and internal targets. During the fourth quarter, tangible book value increased 13.5%, and the TCE ratio increased 67 basis points or 10.3% due to a $100 million improvement and accumulated other comprehensive income. Absent the income from AOCI, the TCE ratio would have been 9.05% at the end of the year, compared to 7.17% as reported. Slide 23 demonstrates that our capital ratios will remain in excess of regulatory targets, including the unrealized losses in the securities portfolio. Our total shareholder return remains robust with 39% of our earnings returned to our shareholders during the period through the common dividend. We believe our dividend provides an attractive return to our shareholders and do not anticipate any near-term changes. However, we will continue to evaluate various capital actions as the year progresses. I'll now turn it back over to Archie for some comments on our outlook going forward. Archie?\nArchie Brown: Thank you, Jamie. Before we end our prepared remarks, I want to comment on forward-looking guidance, which can be found on Slide 25. Loan pipelines remain healthy, though we expect loan growth to moderate as we approach seasonal lows in activity and be in the mid-single digits over the near term. For securities, we expect a decline in balances as we continue to utilize the portfolio of cash flows to support loan growth. Deposit growth in the recent quarter was very strong, but we expect some of the seasonal flows to reverse in the first quarter causing balances to be stable to slightly down. Our net interest margin has remained strong and resilient despite the deposit pressures impacting the industry. We expect some further compression in the first quarter with the net interest margin in a range between 4.05% to 4.15%, assuming no Fed cuts. Specific to credit, we expect our credit costs to remain consistent with the prior quarter, while ACL coverage as a percentage of the loan -- of loans is expected to be stable to slightly increasing. We expect non-interest income to be in a range between $53 million and $55 million as foreign exchange and end-of-term leasing income rebounds to more normal levels and the operating lease portfolio continues to grow. We expect expenses to be between $120 million and $122 million, which includes the depreciation expense from the lease portfolio. Specific to capital, our capital ratios remain strong, and we expect maintain our dividend at the current level. Finally, I want to commend our associates for the great year and record financial results. They were client focused and executed at a very high level despite the industry uncertainty earlier in 2023. I'm extremely proud of the work our team accomplished during the year. As we enter the new year, we have strengthened our team by adding talent in key areas, including wealth management and commercial banking. We've expanded into new markets, including Chicago, Cleveland and Evansville, Indiana. And we've built a strong and diverse company that I believe positions us well to have some sustained success in 2024 and beyond. With that, we'll now open up the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Daniel Tamayo with Raymond James.\nDaniel Tamayo: First, maybe just expanding on the NIM guide. I know you've got some pressure expected in the first quarter without any cuts. But as you think about the rest of the year, maybe relative to the Fed's outlook with three cuts in the back half of the year. Just curious how you think that would impact the margin or net interest income?\nJamie Anderson: Yes. Daniel, this is Jamie. So yes, we do anticipate -- so maybe I'll kind of take it in two parts there. We do anticipate some pressure there in the first quarter. When we look at the way our deposit pricing and our cost of deposits has performed here over the last year or so. It looks like we were about a quarter behind from a lagging perspective. So I think that's why you'll see here in the fourth quarter, our cost of deposits moving up a little bit higher than the peer group. And so I think we have one more quarter of that, which we -- which -- that's included in the -- in that 4.05% to 4.15% guides. But I think we'll have another quarter of that. We think it's around 15 basis points or so. And then going forward, so as we -- as a lot of banks, I mean as we get the first cut or so, it's just -- a lot of it is going to depend on what we can do from a pricing perspective, how quickly we can move deposit prices down. And so -- and that first cut, we are anticipating that we would get very little relief, except from the ones that are basically indexed, but very little relief from the deposit side in that first cut, but then start to get some relief as the Fed cuts further. So that first cut, you're probably talking about a dilutive impact to the margin of around 10 basis points, 10 to 12 basis points, and then it mitigates quite a bit from there and further cuts where it's more like 5 or 6 basis points. So -- and then -- so we have four cuts in our forecast. We have one in March, but obviously late in the quarter, so we have a lot of impact. But basically, one each quarter, and we have our margin in the back half of '24 in that 390 range.\nDaniel Tamayo: Okay. All right. That's very helpful. I appreciate it. I'm just curious, the next question relates to the leasing business, the shift that you mentioned in the comments to the finance leases. What drove that? Is that rate related? I'm just curious what drove that and what your expectations are for -- maybe what would drive that in the future?\nJamie Anderson: Yes. I think we're obviously learning a little bit more about this business as we have it, as we own it longer, we've owned it for a couple of years now. But I mean, really, the economics of those transactions are virtually the same, whether it's a finance lease or an operating lease, I think it's really more up to the customer than it is really us driving it. So they just had more customers fall into that category. And so it's just -- it's really just a geography type of an issue on the financial statements as it goes into the margin with a finance lease as opposed to the operating lease, which shows the gross amounts and non-interest income and noninterest expense. So that's why -- I mean, when you look at our overall -- the volume of earning assets, I think we finished the year a little bit higher than what we had anticipated. And some of that is driven off of the fact that we are including those that we had more finance leases and including those in earning assets versus down in the -- down in other assets.\nDaniel Tamayo: Okay. I understand. So there's some geography moving around, but ultimately about neutral to the bottom line.\nJamie Anderson: Correct. Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy with Stephens.\nTerry McEvoy: I guess I got to ask, can you just shed some light on the $4.6 million trading loss? What changes have been put in place to prevent that from happening again? Or is this just kind of the nature of that business?\nArchie Brown: Yes. Terry, I want to have Bill here, our Chief Credit Officer, answer the question on the trading loss.\nBill Harrod: Sure. Terry. The [indiscernible] with a long-term customer of the trading team even before joining the institution. They had a material business interruption and they're unable to fill their side of the trade. And when you lay this out over about the 40,000 trades you do year in and year out, it's really kind of a one-time thing. It was some spot trades. And so we don't expect it to be systematic through platform. And we have the right oversight and continue to do the lodge and worse on our normal stuff. So we've enhanced some things, but not materially because it's one of the thousands.\nTerry McEvoy: Perfect. And then as a follow-up question, you had impressive growth in loans in the fourth quarter. What portfolios do you think should provide some loan growth over the near term, the mid-single digits is the outlook? And then the flip side is, do you expect to see contraction in any portfolios due to just the business itself or some areas that you might be deemphasizing given the economy and interest rates, et cetera?\nArchie Brown: Yes. Terry, this is Archie. Look, it will be somewhat I think broad-based commercial, you may have seen in the slide, our commercial numbers were a little bit softer in the quarter, and a lot of assets related to continued line paydowns last year, where customers just had liquidity and chose to use that liquidity and pay the line down since rates have moved up. So we don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot more of that. If anything, maybe we should start to see some line draws as we go into 2024. But -- so I think commercial banking will be stronger. Our Oak Street unit had a really good Q4. I think they\u2019ll continue to have some strength early into the year. Summit, Jamie was talking about some of it but Q4 is always just their largest quarter of the year. So that will soften up a little bit in Q1 and then keep ramping through the year. Mortgage has been one that\u2019s kind of been a steady grower, mainly originations may be a little softer, but the payoffs have also been a lot softer. So we think that will continue to grow because of low payoffs. And then ICRE grew a little bit in the quarter, that was -- in Q4, that was primarily line draws on construction loans that drew up. I don\u2019t know that, that will continue at the pace that it did in Q4. Otherwise, the origination activity there is a little softer. So I think we\u2019ll get some decent broad-based growth, but it won\u2019t be at higher levels. With regard to areas we\u2019re deemphasizing, probably most notably is the franchise fixer portfolio. You know that portfolio in the story that over the years, down about $0.25 billion at the end of the year or so. And that\u2019s -- we think that will just continue to amortize down as we have really deemphasized the originating side of that. On the ICRE side, we have certain product areas that we\u2019re -- our team is focusing on. But as you can imagine, we really have deemphasized, really for three to four years now, office, hotels, and we\u2019re very selective even in multifamily and healthcare, industrial. So I think ICRE will be kind of a slow grower as we go through the year.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Chris McGratty with KBW. .\nChris McGratty: Jamie, maybe on net interest income, if I put the pieces together of the remixing of the earning assets and your margin comments, it would feel that kind of the trough would be mid-year, Q2, Q3, kind of mid-140s. Is that about right?\nJamie Anderson: That's right. Yes.\nChris McGratty: Okay. And at that level, like kind of 146, 147 is kind of a fair step down?\nJamie Anderson: That's right. Yes.\nChris McGratty: Okay. And then on -- Archie, maybe on capital, you guys have been consistent like dividends stable and strong buybacks aren't a priority. Is there a capital return narrative for the bank in 2024? You guys have a multiple. Obviously, marks are less onerous. But is M&A something that might be on the horizon?\nArchie Brown: Yes, Chris, thanks for the question. First, supporting growth, we think we've got a diverse kind of a diverse business now that we think is pretty resilient and can grow. And so we're going to support growth, internal organic growth first. The dynamics of M&A need to continue to improve. We saw some -- with rates moving down in December, we saw some I think changes in how purchase accounting may impact capital. And we think that needs to continue to improve to really make that something that's more I think, more realistic in 2024. So we'll have our mind on it some. We're not a -- probably about six years since we've done any bank acquisition mergers. So we're not out there doing a lot of it. There are some areas, markets, types of companies where, I think, have an interest in. And to the extent the accounting works and we feel good about the economy, then I think maybe in the year, you could see us use capital in a way like that. But first and foremost, organically.\nChris McGratty: Okay. Great. And then in terms of credit, your charge-offs and provisions have been a little bit higher than peers. I think it's partly business mix. But can you help us about forecasting what you think is normal in this kind of environment? Should provision levels stay kind of elevated in this range? Or do you expect movement either way?\nArchie Brown: I was looking at some of this -- Chris, if you just go back over the last five or six years and look at, for example, ROA, our ROA is running kind of top quartile of the KRX over that window. And our net charge-offs were maybe 10 basis points higher than kind of the median for KRX. So we like the trade of much higher, consistently higher earnings in that performance. And where is it going to end this year? If you said 25 basis points of charge-offs, plus or minus, that\u2019s probably how we think about it for this year and as we said at the current level of provision at current reserve levels staying stable, slightly increasing. We think we can do that and have a really good year on the earnings side.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the call over to Archie Brown for closing remarks.\nArchie Brown: Mondy, thank you. I want to thank everybody for joining today's call and hearing about our results in the fourth quarter and the full year, we really are proud of the results, and we're excited about 2024. We look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Have a great day and weekend. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's call.

(EBSB) disclosed its fourth quarter 2023 financial results, highlighting a strategic year marked by the restructuring of its portfolio, the sale of its insurance agency business, and the announcement of an upcoming merger. \nThe company reported a net income of $318.5 million, with significant gains from the sale of Eastern Insurance Group. Despite slow loan growth and an increase in nonperforming loans, the bank remains optimistic about its future, particularly with the expected merger with Cambridge Bank in the second quarter of 2024.\nEastern Bankshares Inc. (EBSB) has navigated a transformative period, as reflected in its latest financial disclosures.

Please note, this event is being recorded [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Bob Rivers, Chair and CEO. Please go ahead.\nBob Rivers: Thank you, Julie. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our fourth quarter earnings call. I hope year 2024 is off to a good start. With me today is Jim Fitzgerald, our Chief Administrative and Chief Financial Officer, who will review our financial [inaudible]. As I reflect on the year 2023, it was a year of strategic repositioning for Eastern. We remain nimble in navigating in a certain environment while remaining focused on our strategic priorities. We have emerged from 2023 better and stronger despite all of the year's challenges and believe we are well positioned for success in 2024 and beyond. As we answered 2023, Eastern and all banks were facing a big challenge with higher interest rates, changing customer preferences which placed a greater emphasis on liquidity and general economic headwinds. As you all know, these conditions led to the failures of a few US banks, marking a very tumultuous time for our industry. We responded quickly and boldly to this environment by restructuring our securities portfolio in the first quarter. The sale allowed us to immediately improve both our funding position and our earnings outlook. When we look back at this transaction, we are very pleased with the outcomes and very glad we did it early when the industry headwinds became apparent. After the securities repositioning, we move forward to sell our insurance agency business, Eastern Insurance Group. This too was a very difficult decision as Eastern Insurance had been a core part of Eastern and a significant piece of our culture. The transaction, which closed in the fourth quarter, exceeded our expectations. The valuation premium was very significant and the transaction further strengthened our financial foundation with enhanced liquidity and capital. The transaction also allowed us to think opportunistically about the future. While we were working on the insurance sale, we were able to come to an agreement with Denis Sheahan and the Cambridge Bank of Board on the merger we announced in September. The merger with Cambridge meets all of our acquisition criteria in powerful ways. It is an in-market merger with an extremely attractive partner that we know well and long respected for their strong banking franchise and leading wealth management platform. The combination strengthens our market position in core markets, solidifies our leading position among banks headquartered in the Greater Boston area, more than doubles our wealth business and significantly enhances our financial performance metrics. As a result of these strategic transactions, we enter 2024 with great optimism, strength and excitement for our future. Although, we recognize we need to finish the job and obtain both shareholder and regulatory approval for the merger, we believe we are on track for both and look forward to closing early in the second quarter. As Jim will detail, we expect the first half of 2024 to be focused on the preparation closing and banking conversion of Cambridge. But the strategic benefits of the transaction will be clear in our second half results when the noise settles down. This is very exciting for us. When we went public in 2020, our goal is to close the capital raised in ways that would allow us to generate very competitive returns and build a leading independent Boston banking franchise. We are confident the second half of 2024 will demonstrate success both these ambitions and we look forward to communicating our updates and results along the way. The differences between the start of 2023 and that of 2024 are a vivid contrast. Very much look forward to executing on all of our plans with Cambridge as our partner and our confident that we will achieve the financial targets we laid out back in September. Jim will go through those in more detail shortly. As I turn it over to Jim to discuss all of this in more detail, I offer my endless gratitude and appreciation for our dedicated colleagues at Eastern for persevering through one of the busiest and most stressful years of our careers. But nonetheless, one of the most successful at Eastern as we better position the company financially and strategically. Through their extraordinary efforts in so many ways, they repeatedly demonstrated unfailing support for our customers and community partners and each other through often challenging economic circumstances while putting us in a position for what we believe will be a very successful 2024. I'd also like to again recognize our former Eastern Insurance colleagues. As you can see from our financial results, the value that was created by their hard work over a long period of time resulted in exceptional valuation for their business and gain for our shareholders. We are confident that AJ Gallagher is a great employer for our former colleagues at Eastern Insurance and we wish them the very best. And now I'll turn it over to Jim.\nJim Fitzgerald: Great. Thank you, Bob. And good morning, everyone. As Bob mentioned, the fourth quarter closed a very busy year for us with the securities repositioning in early 2023, the sale of Eastern Insurance late in the year, and the announcement of the merger with Cambridge in September. Sale of Eastern Insurance closed in the fourth quarter and is included in our results. It had a very large and positive impact with a gain of $295 million after tax, which led to improved capital ratios. The net cash proceeds of about $500 million had a positive impact on our liquidity position as well. All-in-all, we continue to be pleased with the execution of the transaction, which exceeded all of our expectations. In addition to the gain and the movement of insurance results to discontinued operations, Q4 had some additional noise with the FDIC special assessment of $10.8 million and some higher compensation expenses. I will go through those through my remarks. First, I'll touch on some highlights of the quarter. Net income for the quarter was $318.5 million or $1.95 per diluted share and was driven by the gain on the insurance transaction of $295 million, which is slightly higher than we projected at the time of the announcement back in September. The transaction improved our TCE ratio by over three percentage points and our CET1 ratio by 2.5 percentage points from Q3. The combination of the cash proceeds from the sale and strong deposit performance in the quarter allowed us to reduce our broker deposits and FHLB advances by $1 billion and we ended the quarter with a nominal amount of wholesale funding. As I mentioned, deposit performance was stronger in the quarter than we had expected and better than the prior couple of quarters. Excluding broker deposits, our core deposits increased by over $500 million in the quarter. We continue to see migration out of lower cost accounts into higher costs but at a slower rate than the prior quarters. Loan growth continues to be slow primarily due to market conditions. Although, we have had a cautious approach while the environment has stabilized. Loan growth in the quarter was 1.5% on an annualized basis. Although, we experienced an increase in nonperforming loans and charge-offs in the quarter, overall levels continued to be modest. We've had very good success in resolving problems as they come up. Of the three office loans that moved to NPL status in the third quarter, which we had mentioned as part of our Q3 results, one property has been sold, one is under contract for sale, and one is currently being marketed. An additional new NPL in Q4 is also undergoing a sales process of the collateral and is under contract for sale. The sales prices are in line with our expectations and in line with our provision levels in the third and fourth quarters. Our Board approved a dividend of $0.11 per share that's payable on March 15 to shareholders of record on March 1, 2024. Turning to the balance sheet, assets were essentially unchanged from the third quarter at $21.1 billion. Loans were up slightly by $50 million to $14 billion, and overall deposits were up by $170 million to $17.6 billion. As mentioned, we were able to reduce our wholesale funds in the quarter by over $1 billion, and our cash position was up $84 million to $700 million. Securities increased by $140 million due to the impact of lower rates and improved valuation, which was partially offset by principal runoff. Shareholder's equity was up by $528 million primarily due to the insurance gain, earnings, and the improvement in AOCI. We're very pleased with where the balance sheet ended the year and think our capital and liquidity should provide us with a competitive advantage over time. As mentioned, and as was expected, the fourth quarter earnings had a lot of noise. The insurance gain was recorded in discontinued operations and was $295 million after tax. This led to net income of $318.5 million or $1.95 per diluted share. For the year, the insurance gain offset the securities loss earlier in the year, and net income was $232.2 million or $1.43 per diluted share. Net interest income was $133.3 million in the fourth quarter, down from $137.2 million in the prior quarter. The reduction of $3.9 million in the quarter was due to higher interest expense. The reduction quarter-to-quarter was 2.8% and overall net interest income was slightly above last quarter's guidance. The FTE net interest margin was 2.69% down from 2.77% in the third quarter. The decline in the margin was due to a faster increase in funding costs of 20 basis points while earning assets were up one basis point. The primary reason loan yields were only up one basis point quarter-to-quarter with some interest recoveries that were recorded in Q3 and made our commercial loan yield higher than it would otherwise have been. The loan loss provision was $5.2 million and I'll cover reserve levels shortly when I get to asset quality. Operating noninterest income was $21.8 million in the quarter, up from $20.7 million in the third quarter. As we discussed on the last call, the third quarter included some small losses on sales of commercial loans, excluding that all operating line items were in line with the prior quarter. Noninterest expense was $121 million in the quarter and $117.4 million on an operating basis. Included in operating expenses were the $10.8 million special assessment from the FDIC and $4.5 million of the operating portion of salary and employee benefits that are higher than where we expect them to be going forward. I'll provide more comments on our expenses going forward when I get to the outlook. As I mentioned in prior quarters, our tax rate was impacted by the securities loss and the insurance gain. The tax expense in the quarter on the operating results was $2.3 million. We experienced a slight increase in nonperforming loans in the quarter from $47.5 million to $52.6 million. As a percentage of loans, NPLs move modestly from 34 basis points to 38 basis points. Net charge-offs in the quarter were $11.4 million or 32 basis points. With essentially no net charge-offs in the first three quarters of the year, full year net charge-offs were nine basis points. Provision expense was $5.2 million, bringing the allowance for loan losses at the end of the quarter to $149 million or 1.07% of total loans and the allowance covered nonperforming loans by nearly 3x. We've been very active in resolving problem loans. Of the three office NPLs from the third quarter, all are being resolved by a property sale. One was sold in the fourth quarter, one is under contract and expected to sell this quarter, and the final one is being marketed. Additionally, we had one new non-office NPL in the fourth quarter that we also expect to resolve this quarter by a property sale. All of the sales prices have been in line with our expectations and in line with the provisions or charge-offs we recorded in Q3 and Q4. We updated our office portfolio page and added some more disclosure on our multifamily and shared national credit portfolios in the presentation. We appreciate the input we received from a variety of investors and analysts that hope that the added information is helpful. We provide the outlook on two pages, one for Eastern, pre-merger, and then a page specific to Cambridge. For Eastern on a standalone basis, we expect the first and second quarters of 2024 to be similar to Q4 of 2023. We experience better deposit performance in Q4 than we anticipated, and we expect that to help stabilize net interest income around current levels. We could see some modest margin declines in early 2024, but believe the margin levels are stabilizing as well. If we do see some Fed rate reductions in 2024, that will benefit both net interest income and the margin, but that will have a greater impact in late 2024 and the full year 2025. We expect that the credit picture this year will be similar to Q3 and Q4 of 2023. We expect trends to start to normalize, and that will lead to increases in nonperforming loans. While we expect these to be contained, we believe our active management of loans as they become more vulnerable will help us work through the resolution process like we have seen over the last two quarters. On the expense front, as I mentioned, certain expenses were elevated in Q4 and will not recur going forward. We expect to start the first quarter with a run rate of operating expenses between $102 and $103 million, which is in line with the guidance of the last quarter. However, we have two major projects in addition to Cambridge that we are completing in the first half of 2024 that will create long-term benefits, but will cause elevated expenses in the first and second quarter. First of these is we are moving our corporate headquarters in Boston. Their themes are as you would expect. We're moving to less space with a lower aggregate cost than what we currently have. The space is also modern and well-designed and will be more aligned with our hybrid working model. We moved in early in the second quarter and we'll have elevated occupancy expense in Q1 and Q2 as we pay for moving costs and the lease overlap. We are also updating our online and mobile banking platforms and will gradually be transitioning customers in Q1 and Q2. We're very excited about the upgrade, but we'll have some overlap of costs as we transition the product. The impact of these is expected to be $3 million each in the first two quarters of 2024 for a total of approximately $6 million. Both projects will be completed by the end of the second quarter. Although, these projects will cause some elevated costs in the short term, we expect both to provide long-term benefits. We expect the tax rate to normalize in 2024 in the 22% to 23% range. Turning to the outlook with Cambridge, we continue to be very excited about the opportunity and confident the combined franchise will be a market leader in all respects. As a reminder, the SEC declared our S-4 effective on January 12th and the shareholder meetings are set for February 28th. We continue to work with our regulators and expect to provide updates as we move forward. Along with the Cambridge team, we've made significant progress in planning for the integrations. Banking integration is planned for the second quarter, and the wealth integration is scheduled for Q3. We believe both conversion plans are tracking very well. We have spent considerable time reviewing and updating all of the financial information we outlined at the announcement last September, and we provide an update on slide 19. As you can see, we have confidence in our ability to meet or exceed just about all of the key financial metrics and are still working through our capital management planning. Our pro forma operating metrics with Cambridge are significant improvements to our standalone financial metrics. We are confident that the combination with Cambridge will provide us with a richer, more profitable business mix and a larger operating platform that will allow us to accelerate the financial improvements we talked about when we went public in 2020. In particular, the expected improvement in the net interest margin and run rate earnings are very significant and put Eastern in a position at the end of 2024 that would have taken a number of years to deliver as a standalone entity. We realized we need to execute well and that it will take until the second half of the year to start delivering these results, but we are comfortable with the projections and very confident in our financial and strategic direction. Thank you and Julie, we're ready to open up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Mark Fitzgibbon from Piper Sandler.\nMark Fitzgibbon: Good morning. It sounds like you guys are pretty confident that you'll get approval in early second quarter on the Cambridge deal. Given that other banks have been waiting much longer for approvals, what gives you that level of confidence?\nJim Fitzgerald: Sure, Mark. I'm sort of joking and hopefully you'll laugh with me. I anticipated that to be your first question, so thank you. I think on a serious note, we have very strong communications and relationships with our regulators. They obviously have a job to do. We've supplied all the information both in the initial application and all the follow-ups, and we understand that they have a job to do, but we'll continue to communicate with them. As I said in previous calls, this timeline is very comparable and similar to what we experienced in the Sentry transaction, and as we have further updates, we'll provide them.\nMark Fitzgibbon: Okay. I wondered if you could possibly give us an updated tangible book value estimate with Cambridge. Obviously, given the movement we've had in rates since the announcement you would think that the tangible book value would be much higher than that 10/16 original estimate. Any comments there?\nJim Fitzgerald: Sure. I would say this, Mark, as you would expect and would know we've updated all of our analysis continuously since September. Spent a lot of time using yearend data the 12/31 both for marking the loans to market and all of the various assets and liabilities. At this point, I'm not sure it makes sense to provide some of that because rates have changed since then and rates will continue to change. We do anticipate this question and understand the interest in it and I think what we say on that is let us think about how best to provide some updates along the way. Again, we're a little bit nervous because things are going to change between now and closing. We don't want certain numbers to be overinterpreted but let us come back on how we could help out with that but also provide it in a way that we think makes sense.\nMark Fitzgibbon: Okay and then wondered if you could share any thoughts around sort of growth for loans excluding the impact of Cambridge and also fees.\nJim Fitzgerald: Sure. I think on the, I\u2019ll start with loans, it continues to be a challenging market for loan growth. We don't see that changing in the next quarter or two. We're very confident that our lending teams both here at Eastern and when we combine with Cambridge are going to be market leaders and should be well positioned but the loan growth that we had in the fourth quarter which was called at 1.5% is very much in line with the low single digits that we've been talking about for the last couple of quarters and I think as we look out a couple of quarters from now that's the same level we'd anticipate. I think one of our jobs here financially is to get the balance sheet in as good a position as possible and we feel like we're making very good strides there so when the market does turn, we'll be very capable of going. And as I said, we have very strong lending teams but at this point that low single digits are what we would continue to guide to.\nMark Fitzgibbon: And then fees, anything?\nJim Fitzgerald: Fees, obviously, the big story there is the wealth fees that are coming over from Cambridge and really changes our income statement in a very positive way. Away from wealth, which I think was your specific question, there's very, what I would consider low single digit growth in those other accounts, deposit services, et cetera. Away from wealth there's not that much going on in those other line items.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Laurie Hunsicker from Seaport Research Partners.\nLaurie Hunsicker: Yes, hi, thanks. Good morning. If we could just go back to sort of pro forma of the deal, maybe a different way to ask it is, can you help us to think about pro forma intangibles?\nJim Fitzgerald: Sure. So I think I may give a similar answer I did to Mark. So Laurie, as you know, the announcement was September 19th. I think the rates that were used for that were September 15th, something very close to that. Rates were lower at 12/31 than they were at that time period in September. And the things that you would expect to happen did happen, right. The mark-to-market was a little bit lower that reduced the amount of the intangibles. Obviously, since then, rates have moved up a little bit. And it's not something you can track every day. There's a process involved there. I think, and it is similar to the spirit we said with Mark, I understand the question, and we want to be helpful there. A little reluctant to put information out that's going to be stale by the time you get it and then change even further between now and closing. But we'd be very open to thinking about sharing things and providing information that would be helpful. Just want to make sure it doesn't sort of create unintended consequences. As I said, by the time I'm a little bit afraid, by the time we get you information, it's going to be stale, which would be the case if we were giving you 12/31 numbers. So but very happy to think about that and come back within a short period of time to see what we can do.\nLaurie Hunsicker: Okay. So I guess probably you're going to have a similar answer then in terms of thinking about accretion impact on net interest income and margin?\nJim Fitzgerald: Yes. I mean, it's a little different. We appreciate all of your questions and interest on that. And we are thinking through how we want to ultimately disclose all that. So your questions are very helpful that way in your insights. So we're thinking through that and we'll come back on that as well. That would be part of the total answer.\nLaurie Hunsicker: Okay. And then just to clarify, when you talked in your comments about modest margin decline for the first half of 2024, that was obviously exclusive of accretion income. Is that correct?\nJim Fitzgerald: That was at Eastern. So definitely so yes, Laurie. That was the comments I was making there were stable net interest income and stabilizing margin at Eastern pre-closing.\nLaurie Hunsicker: Yes. Okay. That's helpful. And then can you just help us think about or maybe what's the spot margin for the month of December?\nJim Fitzgerald: Same as the quarter, 2.69.\nLaurie Hunsicker: Okay. And then what was the timing in the quarter in terms of the reduction on borrowings and FHLB? The borrow for the FHLB. Was that -- when in the quarter for the [inaudible]?\nJim Fitzgerald: Yes. The one lumpy item, lumpy is not a technical term obviously, but the EIG proceeds were call it November 1st and that was approximately $500 million. So that was a component of it. The other reductions were really due to deposit inflows that took place throughout the quarter.\nLaurie Hunsicker: Okay. Great. And then just going back to your, the Class B office, nonperformers, can you just, the four credits, can you just take us through the one that was sold, what was the balance and then what ultimately ended up being the right down there? The one under contract, same thing, the one being marketed, what's the balance, what's the new one? If you could just break out those four so we have it. And then the new one that came in, is that also Class B?\nJim Fitzgerald: Yes, so let me, there is a lot down, let me try and go through slowly. So I'm going to focus first on the three nonperformers from last quarter that were office and they were all in the financial district in Boston, so your memory is very good there. The one that's sold is the one I can provide the information. It was a $9 million loan. The charge-off was $4 million and that closed in the fourth quarter. The one that's under contract for sale is a little bit of a smaller loan and we'll provide the details on that when it actually closes. The third office portfolio nonperformer from the third quarter is being marketed. That's a slightly larger loan. I don't remember that number, the loan balance off the top of my head but it's the larger, it\u2019s the largest of the three. The new nonperforming loan in Q4 was not an office property. It was just a commercial real estate loan. It was approximately a $15 million loan. And we do expect to resolve it this quarter.\nLaurie Hunsicker: Got you. Okay. And then the three, I guess you gave us last quarter, $26 million. Was that $26 million net of the $4 million in charge-offs?\nJim Fitzgerald: At that time, it was gross. So the charge-offs came later. The $26 million was the principal balance, yes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Damon DelMonte from KBW.\nDamon DelMonte: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question this morning. Just a question on expenses. I got the commentary on the first two quarters of the year. We'll have an additional $3 million each for those two projects you have going on. But when we look at the underlying base, I think you said it was like $1.02, $1.03. What kind of growth are you expecting off of that base?\nJim Fitzgerald: Again, putting the two items, the two $3 million items aside, Damon, so the first two quarters would be start at that level, $102 million, $103 million pretty modest growth from there. In fact, those would really be pretty close to run rates for the full quarter. Obviously, Cambridge is coming in and that's going to confuse that a little bit. But if you annualize the $102 million, $103 million, you'd be very close to the yearend to the annualized number that we expect -- would expect without Cambridge.\nDamon DelMonte: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then the commentary around the outlook for credit and more of a normalization. How would you characterize a normalized net charge-off year for you guys?\nJim Fitzgerald: I'm laughing.\nDamon DelMonte: You've got to go back a few years for that probably, right?\nJim Fitzgerald: Yes. No, I think what we believe here is that we were at very low levels. We and the industry, right, were at very low levels for a long period of time. When we look at our current levels and let's just call it nonperformers, again, 40-ish basis points, maybe a touch higher than that, and charge-offs for the year of call it 9 to 10 basis points, we would expect both of those metrics to migrate up a little bit, but in a contained way. We don't see large increases in them, but they were at very low levels for a very long period of time, and as you know, the environment is clearly changing, and we would expect those to move upward. But again, contained is the word we use internally, so it's hard to give you a number, but we don't see big increases there, contained is the word I would say one more time.\nDamon DelMonte: Got it. Okay. I think that's all that I had. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Bob Rivers for closing remarks.\nBob Rivers: Well, thank you for your interest in your questions. And we look forward to sharing more with you during our next earnings call at the end of April. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Thank you.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor. For more information see our T&C."

I would now like to turn the conference call over to Alberto Paracchini, President of Byline Bancorp.\nAlberto Paracchini: Thank you, Brooks. Happy New Year, and thank you all for joining us this morning to review our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. As always, joining me this morning are Chairman and CEO, Roberto Herencia; Tom Bell, our CFO and Treasurer; and Mark Fucinato, our Chief Credit Officer. Before we get into the results for the quarter, I want to pass the call on to Roberto to comment on a few items. Roberto?\nRoberto Herencia: Thank you, Alberto. Good morning, and best wishes for a healthy and happy new year to all. I start my remarks by acknowledging Byline shareholder and friend, Dan Goodwin, who passed away in Chicago last weekend. Dan's story as a human being and business leader is simply remarkable. I met Dan almost 14 years ago and most recently interacted with him prior and after the merger between Byline and Inland Bank. It was important to him that we referred to our coming together as a merger, not an acquisition. That alone tells you much about him and his value system. He was pleased with how we negotiated the key points of the merger, and he was happy to have become a shareholder of Byline. I think he was the happiest when he learned we had selected Pam Stewart as his representative on our Board. And if you've met Pam, you would know why that is the case. Our sympathy and heartfelt players go to his wife and family as well as his extended Inland Bank and Real Estate Group family. We have lost the Chicago Titan, no doubt. Importantly, we have gained so much more for his actions and legacy. A few seconds of silence to honor his memory are appropriate. Thank you. Dan would have been as pleased as I am with the results for the quarter and the full year. 2023 was a breakout year for Byline. Our performance, which Alberto and Tom will cover shortly, is excellent, and several important profitability metrics now rank in the top-quartile of our peer group. Results and budgets for most banks in 2023 were derailed by the March, April events with earnings deviating materially from plans and Boards and management teams grasping for ways to justify weaker results on a relative basis. We are proud not to be part of that group and to be able to have delivered within estimates and plan. It took hard work. We believe the Chicago banking market will continue to be disrupted by events ranging from smaller banks getting weaker, mergers between larger banks with headquarters and decision-making moving outside of state, as well as management changes and turnover. That disruption fuels our organic growth and our strategy, simply put, being home to the best commercial banking talent, continues to shine under those conditions. This is easier said than done. When done well, however, from having the right credit and risk processes, using the right technology, focus and key people practices, and nurturing the team that can finish each other's sentences, the strategy is hard to replicate. We are optimistic about the future and the value our franchise can deliver to our shareholders. With that said, Alberto, back to you.\nAlberto Paracchini: Excellent. Thank you, Roberto. Per our practice, I will start by walking you through the highlights for the full year and quarter. I will then pass the call over to Tom, who will provide you with more detail on our results. Following that, I'll come back to wrap up with some closing remarks before opening the call up for questions. Moving on to Slide 3 of the deck and to start, before I turn to the highlights, I would first like to thank our employees for their hard work and contributions this past year. 2023 was another solid year for the company. We navigated through a challenging rate environment, the market disruptions stemming from the failure of several institutions earlier in the year and an economy that continues to surprise to the upside in terms of growth. Against that backdrop, our diversified business model and continued focus on executing our strategy served us well. In addition, we successfully closed the $1.2 billion merger with Inland, converted systems and fully integrated the operation into Byline within the calendar year. All in all, 2023 was certainly a busy year. For the year, net income was $108 million or $2.67 per diluted share on revenue of just under $387 million. Adjusted for the effects of the merger, our return and profitability metrics were very strong with pretax preparation ROA of 235 basis points, ROA of 145 basis points and ROTCE of just under 18%. Year-on-year loan growth inclusive of Inland was strong at 23%, and better yet, all the growth was funded by deposits, which grew 26%. Our efficiency ratio improved by over 2 percentage points to 52.6% and 5 percentage points to under 50% on an adjusted basis. Lastly, capital remained strong with TCE ending the year at 9%, CET1 at 10.35% and total capital at 13.4%. All of these ratios reflect increases on a year-over-year basis, notwithstanding the impact of the Inland transaction in the third quarter. Turning to Slide 4. Results were also strong for the quarter with net income of $29.6 million or $0.68 per diluted share on revenue of $101 million. Adjusted for merger-related charges, net income was $31.8 million or $0.73 per diluted share. Profitability and return metrics were also solid with record adjusted pretax preparation income of $50.2 million, pretax preparation ROA of 227 basis points, ROA of 144 basis points and ROTCE at 18%. Revenue was slightly down from the previous quarter but up 20% year-on-year. The revenue decline was driven by lower net interest income due to a lower margin as expected, offset by higher noninterest income stemming from higher servicing income. From a balance sheet standpoint, we saw continued growth in both loans and deposits during the quarter. Loans increased by $81.7 million or 5% linked quarter annualized and stood at $6.7 billion as of quarter-end. Net of loan sales, origination activity moderated from the previous two quarters but remained healthy at $241 million, with the increase coming primarily from our C&I and leasing businesses. Payoff activity increased as anticipated and line utilization remained stable at around 55%. Our government-guaranteed lending business continued to originate at a healthy level with $135 million in closed loans, which, as expected, was higher than the previous quarter. Moving on to the liability side. Deposits grew by $223 million or 12.8% annualized and stood at $7.2 billion as of quarter-end. Noninterest-bearing deposits account for 27% of our deposit base and overall deposit cost increases are starting to moderate. Tom will certainly provide you with additional color on the margin and our outlook given the market expectations for lower rates this year. Expenses remain a focus and were well managed for the quarter, coming in at $53.6 million. More broadly, we were able to drive down our efficiency ratio and bring our adjusted cost to asset ratio to 228 basis points. This represents a decline of 7 basis points linked quarter, and importantly, 43 basis points on a year-on-year basis. Turning to asset quality. Provision expense came in at $7.2 million lower than the prior quarter. Charge-offs were elevated at $12.2 million compared to last quarter, reflecting charge-offs taken against loans with previously established reserves as they near resolution and a charge on a purchase credit-deteriorated loan, subject to a credit mark. The allowance for credit losses stood at 152 basis points, NPLs increased 17 basis points to 96 basis points. We added additional detail to the NPL chart on Page 11 of the deck, so you can distinguish between the PCD and non-PCD trends in NPL. Lastly, front-end delinquencies remained flat, notwithstanding the impact of a mortgage servicing transfer completed at the end of the year. We also added additional disclosure on risk ratings, numbers of loans and a balanced stratification for our office portfolio. You can find that on Page 17 of the deck in the appendix. We did not repurchase any shares during the quarter. However, our Board approved a new stock repurchase program that authorizes the company to repurchase up to 1.25 million shares of the company's outstanding common stock. The program is an important component of our overall capital management strategy, which includes investments in the business, M&A, share repurchases, as well as our regular quarterly dividend. With that, I'd like to turn over the call to Tom, who will provide you with more detail on our results. Tom?\nTom Bell: Thank you, Alberto, and good morning, everyone. Starting with our loan and lease portfolio on Slide 5. Total loans and leases were $6.7 billion on December 31. The increase was across all lending categories with the strongest growth coming from our commercial and leasing teams. Average loan balances increased linked quarter and were higher by 23% on a year-over-year basis, driven by organic growth and the Inland merger. We expect loan growth over the course of 2024 to be in the low mid-single digits. Turning to Slide 6. Our government-guaranteed lending business finished the quarter with $135 million in closed loan commitments, which is up 19% and 12% on a linked quarter and a year-over-year basis. At December 31, the on-balance sheet SBA 7(a) exposure was relatively unchanged at $453 million. Our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of the unguaranteed loan balances was 7.8% as of quarter-end, lower as a result of loan upgrades, payoffs and charge-offs related to fully reserved loans, as Alberto mentioned. Turning to Slide 7. We continue to focus on deposit gathering. In the fourth quarter, total deposits increased to $7.2 billion, up 13% annualized from the end of the prior quarter. We saw robust organic deposit growth of $223 million in the quarter, which was net of a $69 million reduction in brokered CDs. Average deposit balances increased quarter-over-quarter and were slightly higher by 24% on a year-over-year basis, inclusive of Inland transaction. Excluding the transaction, deposit growth was a healthy 9.1% for the full year. Our deposit mix continues to moderate as expected with the decelerating pace linked quarter. DDAs as a percentage of total deposits was 27% compared to 28% from the prior quarter, and we expect the shift in mix to continue to moderate and stabilize during 2024. On a cycle-to-date basis, deposit betas for total deposits was 45% and interest-bearing deposits was 61%, driven in part by the repricing of our CD portfolio. In 2023, the CD average maturity rate was 2.32%. For 2024, we expect that CD repricing will have less of an impact given the average rate of the maturing CD book of 4.67%. Turning to Slide 8. Net interest income was $86.3 million for Q4 down 6.7% from the prior quarter. The decrease in NII was primarily due to higher interest expense on deposits and lower accretion income on acquired loans of $5.2 million, offset by loan growth. Our net interest margin remained strong at 4.08% on a reported basis, which was in-line with our NII guidance. Accretion income on acquired loans contributed 24 basis points to the margin in the fourth quarter compared to 50 basis points for the prior quarter. Earning asset yields decreased 26 basis points linked quarter, driven by lower accretion and an increase in fixed rate loans during the quarter. For 2023, net interest income was up $65 million or 25%, which translates to the NIM increasing by 31 basis points year-over-year and ending the full year at a strong 4.31%. Looking forward, given the forward rate curve forecast, we continue to make steps to reduce our asset sensitivity, as highlighted in the IRR section. Based on the factors previously discussed, our estimate for net interest income for Q1 is in the range of $83 million to $85 million. Turning to Slide 9. Noninterest income stood at $14.5 million in the fourth quarter, up 17% linked quarter, primarily driven by a $2.4 million improvement in our loan servicing asset valuation, reflecting lower discount rates and a $1.2 million gain in the change in fair value of equity securities. Sales of government-guaranteed loans decreased $13 million in the fourth quarter compared to Q3. The net average premium was 8.5% for Q4, slightly higher than prior quarter, primarily due to more favorable market conditions and mix of loans sold. Our gain on sale income for Q1 is forecasted to be in the $4.5 million to $5 million range, in line with our historical trends of lower loan production in the first quarter. Turning to Slide 10. Our noninterest expense came in at $53.6 million for the fourth quarter, down $4.3 million from the prior quarter, primarily driven by merger-related expenses taken in Q3. On an adjusted basis, our noninterest expense stood at $50.6 million, $3 million below our Q4 guidance of $53 million to $55 million. We continue to manage our expenses tightly and prioritize investments that are more critical to achieving our strategic objectives. Looking forward, our noninterest expense full year guidance is unchanged at $53 million to $55 million per quarter. Turning to Slide 11. The allowance for credit losses at the end of Q4 was $101.7 million, down 4% from the prior-end quarter. In Q4, we recorded a $7 million provision for credit losses compared to a $9 million in Q3. Net charge-offs were $12.2 million in the fourth quarter compared to $5.4 million in the previous quarter. NPLs to total loans and leases increased to 96 basis points in Q4 from 79 basis points in Q3. NPA to total assets increased to 74 basis points in Q4 from 60 basis points in Q3, and total delinquencies were $36.1 million on December 31, essentially flat linked quarter. Turning to Slide 12, which recaps our strong liquidity and securities portfolio. Our loan-to-deposit ratio decreased 182 basis points linked quarter to 93.4%. We are pleased with this progress and continue to work towards bringing down this ratio over time. Our available borrowing capacity grew to $2.3 billion, and our uninsured deposit ratio stood at 26.7%, which remains below all peer bank averages. Notably, we have the highest insured deposits among the proxy peer group as a result of our very granular deposit base. Moving on to capital on Slide 13. Our capital levels at quarter-end improved with our TCE ratio at 9.1% and our CET ratio at 10.35%. Both ratios improved nicely over the quarter. We grew capital by 29% on a year-over-year basis and our tangible book value per share increased nicely by 11% in 2023 to $17.98, driven by our positive earnings. Given our strong balance sheet, liquidity and capital position, we believe we are well positioned to grow the business and capitalize on market opportunities throughout 2024. With that, Alberto, back to you.\nAlberto Paracchini: Thank you, Tom. Moving on to Slide 14, I'd like to wrap up today with a few comments about the outlook and our strategic priorities for 2024. We entered 2024 on solid footing and with great momentum. In terms of our strategy and priorities, they don't change much and remain consistent from year to year. We believe we can grow our franchise and continue to create value for shareholders. We do this by growing and expanding customer relationships, pursuing disciplined loan growth, improving the efficiencies of the business to allow for continued reinvestment, maintain credit and capitalizing on market opportunities to both add talent and pursue M&A. Again, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on opportunities to continue to grow the value of our franchise. And with that, operator, let's open the call up for questions.\nOperator:\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Nathan Race of Piper Sandler.\nNathan Race: Yes. Hi, everyone. Good morning. I hope everyone is doing well.\nRoberto Herencia: Good morning.\nNathan Race: I was hoping to just start off on the charge-offs this quarter. And looking through the slide deck, it looked like an office commercial real estate property contributed some of those charge-offs. So, I would be curious maybe to get some additional color from Mark in terms of the outlook for the remaining portfolio and kind of what you're seeing in terms of potential maturities? And how those maturities kind of stack up with cap rates going up and so forth, and just the overall asset quality outlook within that portfolio?\nMark Fucinato: We have a good handle on the office maturities going out for the next two years, and we've been discussing it a lot right now what's coming up in the first two quarters of the year. We're in very good shape. We're actually seeing some opportunities for some of these customers to refinance their office buildings, which is a little bit of a surprise to me. But we're in good shape overall on the office book in terms of a percentage of our overall portfolio. So, there are going to be situations where some of them are going to be criticized assets. But as you know, they're unique, and we're going to approach them with a tailored kind of strategy with the customer to see what the outcomes are going to be of any credit issues that we see. On the charge-offs, yes, we had a charge-off on an office asset. But again, that's part of our strategy that we're using to resolve that particular asset, and we're hoping to achieve those results here during the course of 2024.\nNathan Race: Okay. Very helpful. Thank you. Maybe changing gears, thinking about the NII outlook for this year. I apologize if you touched on it in your prepared remarks, Tom, and I didn't catch your thoughts. Just in terms of kind of the outlook for kind of core NII ex accretion over the next couple of quarters, assuming the Fed remains on pause, and then we get a couple of rate hikes in the back half of the year, how do you kind of see NII trending over the course of 2024?\nTom Bell: Yeah, hi. Good morning, Nate. In the prepared remarks, I basically -- we're using the forward curves as our estimate for interest rates and the market has anticipated 150 basis points in Fed fund reduction for the year. So given that, which I think the first ease happening in March, we've given guidance of $83 million to $85 million for NII. And in the supplemental stuff, we have the accretion forecast in the back for your reference, just kind of split that out.\nNathan Race: Okay. So if we do get that degree of rate cuts this year, it's fair to expect it would contract. But if we just get maybe a couple in the back half of the year, it's fair to assume maybe a little bit of growth year-over-year?\nTom Bell: Yes, that could be possible, again, subject to what happens with the Fed and market expectations. On the net interest income page of the deck, on Page 8, we provided some information on our interest rate risk sensitivity over one year. And we've been able to reduce our sensitivity by 1.8% year-over-year, but we still are asset sensitive. So you can see both in a ramp scenario and a static scenario, what the give up in NII is to the bank's net interest income number. So, we provided in 100 basis point downward, it's about 3.3% in a ramp, and it's 2.5% -- I'm sorry, that 3.5% on a static and ramp is 2.5% decline. And we provided you the quarterly costs as well on an annualized basis.\nAlberto Paracchini: I think, Nate, to add to what Tom is saying there just more broadly, so I think if you look at kind of what the market has priced in terms of rate cuts for 2024. As you can see from the materials, we remain asset-sensitive. Certainly, as Tom covered in the prepared remarks, we're seeing moderation in terms of deposit pricing as well as moderation in kind of mix changes. Rate decline certainly will help in that regard. That being said, we remain asset-sensitive. So rate declines are going to impact the asset side negatively in the sense that you're going to be repricing assets, and that's going to have an impact, that's going to be faster than the reprice and liabilities. That being said, that assumes kind of the market view in terms of interest rates to the degree that rates move lower, faster or come earlier in the year faster that obviously impacts the margin negatively to the degree that they're slower, it impacts the margin positively. But all in all, we still feel pretty good about our ability to grow assets and continue to expand net interest income.\nNathan Race: Got it. And just within that kind of outlook, if the Fed remains on pause for the first half of this year and just kind of think about the cadence in loan yields from here, I imagine you guys have put in new loans on the portfolio above kind of the rate that we saw or the yield that we saw in the fourth quarter. And would just also be curious to hear in terms of those 40% of loans that are fixed, what amount of maturities do you have over the next 12 months that could reprice higher?\nTom Bell: Well, I mean, you have to remember, if you're doing fixed rate loans, the market's already kind of priced in the Fed easing. So, we price for market takers, so to speak. So we price to a spread to the curves. So in some cases, right, the punitive thing to net interest income right now is fixed rate loans because you tend to lose spread on a marginal cost basis, like if you were going to the home loan bank. So, I think that you have to be mindful of that, whether you do balance sheet hedges or other things to protect the earnings, you're technically layering on some fixed rate loans that they're in the 7.5% range that maybe on a floating rate basis would be higher just given the spread on SOFR.\nNathan Race: Got you. If I could just ask one last one on just kind of the outlook for deposit growth. It looked like you had some nice core deposit generation in the fourth quarter. Is the expectation that core deposit growth will largely follow that kind of low to mid-single-digit outlook for loans in this year?\nAlberto Paracchini: I don't know that we've ever given guidance in terms of deposits, Nate. But as you've been covering us for a long time, and I think you know how important we feel deposits are and the ability for us to continue to grow deposits, and I think the plans are to continue to do that. Obviously, that's subject to client preferences, that's subject to doing the right thing for customers. And obviously, our competitors who are trying to do the same thing. But I think broadly, I would say, look, we continue to want to have strategies in place to continue to grow deposits. I think this quarter, as Tom mentioned, we saw a nice decline on our loan-to-deposit ratio. We want to continue to drive that. Over time, we're operating -- we were -- if you recall, we were operating closer to 95%. We gave guidance that said that we wanted to bring that ratio down over time, and we are very much wanting to continue to do that. So, I think you should think in the context of continuing to see that ratio come down closer to 90%, even below 90% over time.\nNathan Race: Got you. And was there any seasonality in the core deposit growth in the fourth quarter? Or was it more just kind of blocking and tackling and ongoing market share gains?\nTom Bell: Blocking and tackling.\nAlberto Paracchini: Yes. I think the latter. As you know, we tend to see seasonality. We have obviously a commercial focus in our business, inclusive in the liability side. So you have tax payments, you have all those things that tend to happen right around the first quarter. So, we'll see some seasonality there. But that was not the case at the end of the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Terry McEvoy from Stephens Inc.\nTerry McEvoy: Hi. Good morning, everybody.\nAlberto Paracchini: Good morning, Terry.\nTerry McEvoy: Hi. Just maybe start with a question on expenses. If you grow organically, let's say, 10% a year, you're going to cross $10 billion in less than two years. So I guess my question is how much of the incremental expenses from crossing $10 billion are in that current run rate of, what, $53 million to $55 million? And should I be worried about a step-up in 2025?\nAlberto Paracchini: I think -- let me answer the question maybe two ways. First off is, Terry, we've always kind of run the business on the expectation that we want the company to be able to, from a risk management, from a kind of reporting, from a control perspective, not get behind to the growth of the business. And what I mean by that is, over time, we've always consistently invested to make sure that we have the requisite level of controls, the requisite level of investment to keep in conjunction to the growth of the business. So, to answer your question, just by the mere fact that at some point, we will cross that $10 billion mark, doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to see a step function of an increase in expenses that would be, call it, very significant. That being said, along with growth in assets, along with growth in revenues and the growth in expenses that would correspond with that, I think you can anticipate expenses to increase to continue for us, to continue to make sure that we're making the right investments to meet the higher expectations that come with crossing that $10 billion mark. So, proportionately, I think we want to continue to operate along the lines of what we've mentioned during our calls. We have always been keeping an eye on expenses, maintaining discipline around expenses. As you saw this quarter, we saw a nice decline on the cost-to-asset ratio. We took that to -- on an adjusted basis to 228 basis points. That's a material decrease from where we were operating last year. So, we want to make sure that we continue to proportionately gain scale irrespective of if we cross the $10 billion mark or not. So hopefully, that gives you some color in terms of how we think about that.\nTerry McEvoy: Yeah. Thanks for the color there. Helpful. And then just kind of getting out of the earnings model, what's it going to take to get utilization rates back to pre-COVID levels, which kind of what 62%, 63%? And if we get back there, what does that mean to noninterest-bearing deposit balances? And is it that case where you got to watch what you wish for?\nAlberto Paracchini: So, that's a really good question. The short answer is, Terry, we really don't know. You would have expected that you would have seen utilization revert back by now post COVID. I think there's a couple of things that are probably coming into play. We're a larger bank now. We're a little different than we were right before COVID, so maybe the mix that we have today is slightly different, which could be impacting kind of overall line utilization or call it, the line utilization percentage that we report. The second piece is, I'm a little skeptical of mean reversion going back to, call it, kind of 2019 levels from the fact that, given the discrepancy from borrowers with much higher interest rates today, if you were sitting on cash and you had the flexibility, you would probably just pay down the line or you would frankly move the money to a higher-yielding alternative. We've seen some of it, but we haven't seen that in mass in our book. So, I guess what you're hearing is, we're probably a little skeptical of that utilization rate, fully mean reverting back to what it was in 2019.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Long from Raymond James. David, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nDavid Long: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nAlberto Paracchini: Good morning, David.\nDavid Long: I want to follow up on the deposit discussion. And as you look out for the rest of the year, if we do get some rate cuts, what do you expect out of the deposit beta on the downside at this point?\nTom Bell: That's a good question. I think, again, subject to the Fed, short-term rates are certainly higher today. We're actually inverted right on overnight to one year, which we were flat before. So, we're already seeing some benefits to repricing some of our, I'll call it, book of CDs that are on the shorter end of the curve. But we have -- our CD book is about 8.5 months. So it's relatively short, and we've been positioning the bank to try and adjust betas down. Obviously, the CD book will reprice more on at a 89% -- 85% to 90% reduction. And then the core accounts will continue to operate as we have in our model in that, call it, again -- some of our products, the rack rates haven't really moved, so you can't really lower those rates but your high-yield money market accounts, certainly, we expect the betas to be pretty substantial on the way down.\nDavid Long: Got it. Thank you, Tom. And then...\nAlberto Paracchini: Yeah, I think, David, just to add two things to what Tom said, I think in Tom's remarks earlier, when you think about that CD book, the average rate on the maturities that we're seeing for 2024 was like 4.67%, I think. So, just keep that in mind relative to kind of, as Tom said, if the duration of that portfolio is 8.5 months, and you have a rate at 4.67%, you kind of can see where market rates are. So that gives you a sense in terms of kind of what the reprice would be, all else being equal. If you have declines in rates, obviously, that's going to come into play, obviously, subject to competitive dynamics in the market and so forth. But I think to Tom's comments and the comments earlier in the call, I think the deposit pricing is starting to moderate. I think it will be rate-dependent. If we get rates declining faster, obviously, that's going to impact that more in a quicker fashion. If rates lag for a little bit, that's going to be slower. But on that end, to the degree that it's slower than what the market repricing, given our interest rate positioning at this point, that's probably to our benefit as opposed to our detriment. So, just keep that in mind.\nTom Bell: The only other thing I would add to, David, is this quarter, right, we had a significant reduction in our FHLB borrowings, and we had a brokered CD mature. So that's $384 million of wholesale type pricing. And that -- which that ultimately gave us less cash at the Fed, so to speak. So liquidity is still really strong, even improving. So it's -- that's going to help just the NII numbers as well.\nDavid Long: Got it. Okay. Cool. Thanks. And then wanted to talk M&A just for a second here. The Inland deal seems to have gone pretty well. Integration, mostly done with that. First question is, are you seeing a pickup in discussions or serious discussions? And then, secondly, what is Byline's appetite to do something else at this point?\nAlberto Paracchini: I think let me take the latter question first. I think our appetite is high. I think we are certainly open to entertaining M&A. To the prior question, to the first part of the question, in terms of kind of what's the environment for M&A, I think -- look, I think it's -- clearly, with the rally in rates towards the end of the year, I think a lot of the friction that was causing M&A to be very difficult for a lot of institutions, meaning the impact of AOCI, the impact on interest rate marks on portfolios, that's gotten better. It's not to say that we've reverted back to where it was maybe 18 months ago, but it's certainly gotten better, which I think given the recent announcements that you've seen, I think it's indicative of the fact that M&A and the M&A math, so to speak, is getting a little bit easier for people. So, as far as we're concerned, look, we remain -- we have our kind of our framework for evaluating M&A. We continue to think that there's going to be consolidation. We think we are a terrific partner for institutions that are looking for a long-term partner, and we're hopeful that there will be some activity in 2024.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Damon DelMonte from KBW.\nDamon DelMonte: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but just a couple of little ones here. Regarding the outlook for expenses here in the first quarter, I think the guide was $53 million to $55 million. Tom, can you just kind of help walk us from kind of like the operating number of sub-$51 million up to that level? Does it come in through salaries and benefits, or is it data processing? Just kind of looking for some guidance there.\nTom Bell: Some of it is definitely salaries and benefits. We've had some delays and some hires that we're still looking to seek out as well as some new teams to bring into the organization from a business perspective. The real estate numbers that came in were actually a little bit lower than what we originally accrued for, and so that won't materialize in 2024. So, we're trying to give full year guidance there. I think we would expect to be a little bit on the lower side, on the guidance side of $53 million, maybe for Q1. But absent that, we think just given the spend that we want to make to invest in the business and bring on teams, we're going to have to increase cost to do that.\nDamon DelMonte: Got it. Okay. All right. That's helpful. Thank you. And then as we think about the provision expense going forward and kind of like a normalized net charge-off level, I think you had like 38 basis points last quarter, and that's on the rise from the last two years, understandably. But do you think that high 30s, 40 basis point level is reasonable going forward?\nAlberto Paracchini: I think we've always said, Damon, somewhere in the kind of the 30 to 40 basis point range historically, and I still think we're comfortable with that. Keep in mind a couple of things that maybe are a little different today than historically. We added some additional disclosure for PCD loans. I mean those are loans that, over time, you can expect us to try to move those out of the bank relatively quickly. We'll add to the degree that we take charges related to those. As you know, those are obviously subject to a credit mark. So, we'll disclose and give you color around that. But back to the first part of your question, in terms of kind of like the underlying rate, I still think that 30 to 40 basis points is reasonable.\nDamon DelMonte: Got it. Okay. And then just lastly, looking at the deposit base, do you have any deposits that are tied specifically to an index rate so that if and when the Fed does cut rates, you'll get some relief in that portion of the portfolio?\nTom Bell: Yes. I mean some of the deposits we have that are like brokered money market accounts, they're tied to Fed funds, and they're on for our balance sheet hedge purposes. So, we'll see an immediate benefit from that. And then, there's a few clients that are more in the public entity space where we were tied more to an index there. So, we'll get definite relief immediately 100%.\nOperator: Your next question is from Brian Martin from Janney Montgomery Scott.\nBrian Martin: Just a follow-up, Tom. I was going to ask you to Damon's question. Can you walk through what -- on a rate cut, what reprices on the asset side, an immediate or a lag? And then on the deposit side, if you can just quantify some of that? Can you give some color on what moves immediately versus it being a lag and just how much of it?\nTom Bell: Well, again, I would point you to Slide 8 where we have our interest rate risk profile. We give you the scenarios of how we've reduced our asset sensitivity on a year-over-year basis and then what happens in a static 100 basis point decline in a ramp decline of 100. And that would include our assumptions around repricing of both assets and liabilities. So, we are asset sensitive, and we have, in a static, 100 basis points, it's $3 million per 25 basis points. So that would be earnings -- that would be the NII give-up.\nAlberto Paracchini: On an annual basis.\nTom Bell: On an annualized basis. So again, subject to the timing, it's challenging because if the Fed -- as you know, if the Fed eases in March, well the SBA book gets repriced immediately in April. And if they ease in May, then that actually takes place in July. So timing matters, both on the asset side and the liability side. And based on our -- the forward curves, which we're using for our rate forecast, the expectation is the numbers I quoted you on an NII basis.\nBrian Martin: Okay.\nTom Bell: But the book...\nBrian Martin: And how much of the loan book is variable? Go ahead. I'm sorry.\nTom Bell: No, it's under 50%. We have 48% in fixed rate and then the combination of Prime and SOFR or the other parts. So it's kind of 50-50-ish. But again, you have investment portfolio, it's straight as well. So it's a little bit skewed, 60-40.\nAlberto Paracchini: Yeah. And if you -- even when you think about -- and I think Brian, I think this is an important point. So even when you think about the fixed rate component, which, let's say, it's roughly around 48%, remember, a lot of those are really commercial loans, which are going to be shorter in tenure than, for example, a fixed rate mortgage loan. So, those are going to be typically, it's -- let's assume it's like a 3-year, 3.5-year duration on those assets. So every year, you have about a third of that component, roughly speaking, that is going to be repricing as well. So just keep that in mind.\nTom Bell: Yes, we'd say our loan base is about 52%.\nBrian Martin: Okay. Just, I guess, a couple of -- there are one or two others. Just on the capital, you talked about M&A. Just as far as the buyback, can you talk about your appetite there versus the M&A? It sounds as though M&A might be more of interest in the short term than the buyback and having the buyback in place if something doesn't pan through on that. So that was one. And then just secondly, as a follow-up on your M&A outlook, just remind us what -- if you talk about what are the characteristics of a target that are value to you today.\nAlberto Paracchini: So in terms of -- to the first part of your question, I think, Brian, it's just we're very, very consistent in how we think about capital allocation, first and foremost. When you think in terms of priorities, it's to support the growth of the business. So we want to make sure that we have more than enough capital to continue to grow our business, continue to invest in the business, talent, infrastructure, et cetera. As it pertains to the next several categories, the dividend, the M&A or ultimately the buybacks, obviously, we want to -- we're endeavoring to continue to make sure that we are paying our dividend. And M&A is really a function of -- you need, obviously a counterparty that has to be like-minded. You need to strike a transaction, and that transaction from a return perspective, from an earn-back perspective, from a strategic and also culturally for the business has to make sense. So, if all of those categories check -- we can check the box in those categories, then that's basically telling you that we feel like M&A is superior to -- we have excess capital, we have no better use for it, and therefore, we can look to the buyback to return that capital back to shareholders. So, I would think about that in that priority. And then, you asked a question about targets. I think when we think about targets today, obviously, we're a slightly larger company. We've grown as a company over time. But we still think that kind of the target market is somewhere between $250 million, $300 million to up to about $4 billion in the greater Chicago metropolitan market. That comes about to around 50 targets in that category today. And that, I would say, would be kind of -- continues to be our target market.\nBrian Martin: Got you. Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just one for Mark on the credit side. Just with the -- can you comment, Mark, just on the change, if there was any, and if you put this in the deck and I missed it, I apologize, the special mention credits kind of how they trended from third to fourth quarter? And then, just areas that -- I guess you're paying closer attention to today, give us some of the dynamics during the last 90 days or so in the market?\nMark Fucinato: Special mention credits, you said? Okay. Well, special mention credits, there was an increase, but we also had good resolutions in that area also. We continue to see good resolutions. But at the same time, we're dealing with a lot of our PCD credits that have moved in terms of rating and I expect that to be a lot of the same activity we're going to see this year. There'll be ins, there'll be outs. But some of the moves we're making strategically on these credits that we want to either exit or look to upgrade is going to be the key. Can we execute those strategies? Which are unique to each particular deal? I think we can, there's no trend in terms of what particular asset class is in the criticized book. We're not seeing one area where we're seeing a big increase. It's just been -- there's been things in the commercial book, there's been things in the SBA book, there's been things that have popped up in different asset classes, but no trends. I'm not sure if that answered your question, Brian, or not.\nBrian Martin: Yes, broadly, just the trend is what I'm trying to get my arms around. So they have ins and outs, helps. And just in terms of areas you're maybe watching more closely this year, at least in the near term, can you give any commentary on that?\nMark Fucinato: I'm watching, obviously, like everybody else in this country, office, carefully. Even though that's not a big part of our portfolio, we spent a lot of time looking at it, upcoming maturities, appraisal values and what our sponsors are saying about those assets. And then, the SBA book is still dealing with the higher rates that impacts their customers. And that is not going to ease up too quickly. So, we have to keep an eye on that portfolio also to see if these companies can continue to sustain their payments at those rates that they've had to deal with for the last 18 months.\nBrian Martin: Okay. Got you. That's helpful. And maybe just last big picture question for Alberto. Just Alberto, if you look at talking about last year being a breakout year for Byline, if you look at where you feel like the greatest opportunity for Byline is this year kind of given the market conditions today. Can you just speak broadly to that? Where you feel like you guys in your business model can really excel today? Is there any certain areas that you can be more opportunistic this year?\nAlberto Paracchini: I think the short answer, Brian, is yes. And I would say we remain very optimistic about the current market position that we have here in Chicago. To give you an example, so -- and I think we might have touched on this at some point towards the latter -- maybe the second quarter call or the third quarter call, were there seemed to be a lot of -- you were hearing the word risk-weighted asset diets, primarily coming from larger super regionals or larger regional banks in anticipation of potentially kind of the Basel III endgame where we saw a lot of people in the market simply close their doors to new opportunities. And we are a relationship-oriented bank. We want to be able to be there for clients and lend through the cycle. And we certainly saw opportunities to do that over the course, particularly, the latter part of 2023. I think some of that will continue into 2024. I also think, as you well know, we benefit from any type of disruption in the market when it comes to customers and also importantly for us when it comes to our ability to pick up high-quality banking talent. We anticipate that we will see opportunities to do that, and we expect to do that in 2024. So, we're optimistic about our ability to grow going forward and our ability to continue to add talent and customers in the market.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you for your questions today. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Alberto Paracchini for any closing remarks.\nAlberto Paracchini: Great. Thank you, Carla, and thank you all for joining the call today and for your interest in Byline. We look forward to speaking to you again next quarter. And before we leave, I just want to -- Brooks want to give you a heads up on our conference schedule for the first half of the year.\nBrooks Rennie: Thanks, Alberto. Yes, for investors this quarter, we plan on attending the KBW conference along with the Piper Sandler West Coast Conference. And with that, that concludes our call this morning. Hope everyone has a nice weekend. Goodbye.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor. For more information see our T&C."

At this time, it is my pleasure to introduce Customers Bancorp Chair, Jay Sidhu.\nJay Sidhu: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Customers Bancorp fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings call. Joining me this morning are President and CEO of the Bank, Sam Sidhu; Customers Bancorp CFO, Carla Leibold; Customers Bank CFO, Phil Watkins. I will give you some introductory comments and then my colleagues will provide details of the quarter and for the full year 2023 for you. While the banking industry has largely recovered following the events from last spring, there is still a lot of uncertainty and lot of headwinds facing our industry. However, customers, banks, differentiated strategy, bucked industry trends gaining strong momentum in 2023 and we expect that to continue into 2024. We continue to execute on our strategic priorities and are pleased to report that we are delivering another strong quarter for our shareholders. We are also very excited about the prospects and look forward to sharing our outlook for 2024 with you later on in this presentation. As a forward-thinking bank with strong risk management, we believe we are creating tremendous franchise value across the bank through execution of our profitable customer centric model. In addition, we have and will continue to capitalize on market disruption as an opportunity to create new and deeper existing client relationships, resulting in stronger loan and deposit growth. As you know, we are reporting $1.90 of core EPS for Q4 2023 with continued deposit transformation, higher margin, no expense growth during the quarter. We generated $1.1 billion of core deposit growth in the quarter. We used these deposits to improve the overall quality of our funding base, including the planned exit of BMTX deposits from our bank on December 1st, as well as paying off about over $700 million of high rate wholesale CDs during Q4. Capital levels increased substantially again with our tangible common equity to tangible asset ratio now over 7% and our CET1 increasing to 12.2%. We are extraordinarily proud of our ability to meet and exceed our capital goals that we outlined to you earlier last year. Asset quality remains exceptional with our NPA ratio down in the quarter and reserve levels are robust at almost 500%. We have only about a 1% loan exposure to the office sector of commercial real estate. And our average loan size to the office is less than $4 million. We believe the office sector will continue to create challenges for the industry in the coming quarters. In addition to the future benefit from continued benefit from our deposit franchise, as well as top quartile capital ratios, we are seeing attractive origination opportunities. These are primarily loans where we have a holistic and primary relationship with the client. We have ample liquidity and capital to support a 10% to 15% loan growth in 2024. Moving on to Slide 4, I\u2019d like to take a moment to reflect back on the promises we made going back to our 2018 Investor Day, just about five years ago. Today, on the fifth anniversary of this Analyst Day, we are thrilled to day that we have delivered on all these promises, the promises that we made to you at that time. Here they go. Here let me share those with you. Number one, we are now, as I said earlier, 7% TCE ratio. And at that time, we were talking about perhaps getting to 7%. Number two, we've delivered 15% average annual tangible book value growth. And at that time, we were shooting for just under 10%. We've achieved a NIM of 3.31. And at that time, we were at 2.40 NIM. We have a core ROA of 1.22% and our goal was at least 1%. We are reporting a return on common equity of 18.3% and our goal was at least 10%. And we delivered $7.72 of core EPS in 2023, surpassing our $6 EPS goal for 2025. So we are at least two years ahead. And most important is that we maintained a strong risk management culture throughout this period. Turning to Slide 5. We again reiterate our priorities to you which remain absolutely unchanged. They are moderating growth during these uncertain times while strengthening our balance sheet and having a strong risk management culture. We are so proud of what we've accomplished in 2023 in an extremely challenging environment for our industry. Our commitment to risk management and a client first mindset, where clients say, wow, is positioning us well to navigate in this challenging environment. I want to salute and express our gratitude and thanks to all our team members for their hard work and their continued dedication to serving our clients flawlessly. Lastly, we want to recognize all our investors for their support and confidence in us. As you know, Customers Bancorp was the number one performing publicly traded bank stock in the United States in 2023 as measured by stock price and total shareholder return. Clearly, the markets are recognizing the strength of our performance. And we commit to doing everything in the long run and the short term to serve our clients and provide solid returns to our investors. Before I pass the call on to Sam, I want to welcome Hal Goetsch to the call. Hal joins the call from B. Riley Securities, where he recently initiated coverage on Customers Bancorp. We want to thank all of the research analysts for their efforts and the insights that they bring to the bank and to the investment community. With that, I'll turn it over to Sam to cover the key activity and results of the quarter in much more detail.\nSam Sidhu: Thanks, Jay, and good morning, everyone. We will provide more detailed guidance on 2024 at the end of the presentation, but we did want to flag our key areas of focus for the year in my initial comments. Number one, continuing our deposit transformation remains a key priority, which we will achieve through market share gains supported by treasury management and transaction banking build-outs. We've made significant strides in 2023, positively remixing 15% of our deposits in just the last three quarters alone. Having said that, we're just getting started and continue to have a strong pipeline, which we're looking to bolster with deposit focus, talent and teams. Number two, as Jay mentioned, we bucked the industry trend by expanding margin in 2023. We'll look to sustain that momentum in '24 with continued improvement of our deposit franchise and also by remixing into higher yielding loans. Number three, we're focused on driving profitability through our steadfast commitment to operational excellence and expanding fee income opportunities. The hard work in '23 to improve our technology and human capital infrastructure we expect will pay huge dividends in '24 and beyond. Number four, we will continue to maintain a strong capital base and liquidity while growing our loan portfolio. Number five, we will never deviate from our credit first principles. We will achieve this through ensuring the right client selection where we have a fulsome two-way relationship. Number six, making our clients say wow, is what increases customer engagement and build franchise value, especially given the void created by the recent market disruption. Moving to Slide 7. You can see our GAAP financial highlights for the fourth quarter and the full year '23. Turning to Slide 8. I'll comment on our core results for the quarter and year. In the fourth quarter of '23, we produced extremely strong results across all profitability metrics, earning $1.90 in core EPS on net income of $61.6 million. For the full year of '23, we produced core EPS of $7.72 on net income of $248 million. 2023 was an exceptional year in which we delivered a record $687 million in net interest income. This record is all the more impressive given that prior years benefited significantly to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars from our efforts in PPP. Our core ROA for the fourth quarter was 1.22% and our core ROE was 16.9%. For the full year '23, our core ROA was also 1.22% and our core ROE was 18.3%. We continued our margin momentum in the quarter. The combination of our strong deposit growth and interest earning asset yield increase led to margin expansion of 11 basis points in the fourth quarter to 3.31%. This was up from 3.2% last quarter after adjusting for the outsized accretion from the portfolio we acquired from the FDIC. We continued to transform the quality of our deposit balances, which I'll provide more detail on shortly. The modest decline in deposits in the quarter was driven by the planned outflows of service deposits that we previously disclosed as well as by the repayment of over $700 million of high rate wholesale CDs. This is a very strong base for us to grow off of in '24. Credit quality remained strong as evidenced by our NPA ratio of just 13 basis points, and reserve levels remained robust at almost 500% of NPLs. While we do not see any signs of weakness in the portfolio, we remain highly focused on portfolio management. Turning to Slide 9. I want to provide some additional color on the impact of the delivery of promises Jay discussed earlier. Over the last five years alone, we have grown our balance sheet at a 17% compounded annual growth rate. But more importantly, we've also more than doubled our deposits over the same time period. We accomplished this growth without raising a single dollar of common equity capital. Our loan-to-deposit ratio is now 72% as compared to 120% at the end of 2018. And our liquidity position has increased about 10 times with our cash and short duration available for sale securities portfolio available to provide us ample liquidity to reinvest into loan growth in '24. Now let's turn to Slide 10 to discuss how this transformation has improved our core profitability. Over the same five year time period, we have increased net interest income by a 22% CAGR and improved our net interest margin by more than 70 basis points. Diluted EPS is up by more than 4 times and our return on equity has increased by more than 900 basis points. While we are very proud of the transformation we have accomplished, we believe the best days for Customers Bancorp are ahead of us. The investments in talent and technology that we made over the last several years are reflected in our best-in-class performance metrics in '23. Looking ahead, there are still many strategic opportunities for us over the near term. We continue to see a large opportunity to capitalize on the once and generation dislocation in the banking industry putting commercial clients and most importantly, deposit teams in motion, especially in verticals where we have existing deep expertise. If we capture mere basis points of market share, it will have a material impact on our franchise and anything in percentage point terms will be truly transformational. We have been extremely focused on operational excellence by improving our people, processes and technology and expect these continued efforts will pay dividends, driving positive operating leverage. This operational excellence is evidenced by the doubling of our balance sheet since 2018 but our employee count is down by almost 20% over a similar time period. As Carla will provide more detail on later, starting late in 2022 and accelerated early in \u201823, we undertake efforts to exit non-strategic relationships to materially increase our capital levels. These efforts are now bearing fruit as we have ample risk weighted capital and liquidity to fund strategic franchise enhancing loan growth. We look forward to delivering for our clients and shareholders again in '24 and beyond. Turning to Slide 11, the highlight of the franchise. We again generated strong core deposit growth of $1.1 billion in the quarter. This represents our third consecutive $1 billion-plus growth quarter and enabled us to repay $743 million in high cost wholesale CDs in the quarter. The $3.1 billion of deposit growth in just the past three quarters represents a 15% positive remix of our deposit franchise. It is worth noting that our noninterest bearing deposits increased by over about $1 billion over the same time period and $2.5 billion over the course of 2023. This is a huge testament to the power of our team in action. Similar to last quarter, I want to highlight not just the quantity but also the quality and granularity of this deposit growth. The growth we achieved was a team effort across the franchise. Once again, more than 20 of our deposit channels saw growth in the quarter. More than 40% of these deposit channels experienced growth of $25 million or more, demonstrating the broad based nature and quality of our deposit transformation. Total new commercial accounts opened in the quarter again was impressive and an excess of 500. As expected, our cost of deposits increased slightly by 15 basis points in the quarter, due in large part to the planned noninterest bearing service deposit outflows. I'd note that our interest expense continued to trend in the right direction, declining by $3 million in the quarter, positively impacting our net interest income. This is in contrast to all of the industry and driven by our deposit gathering successes. We remain deeply focused on the quality and stability of our deposits. And at the end of the quarter, 77% of our deposits were either insured or collateralized. This metric keeps us in a very strong position relative to regional bank peers. Even after our success in the quarter, our core deposit pipeline remains robust at approximately $1.5 billion as we continue to backfill the previous growth. We anticipate onboarding this pipeline over the next two to three quarters. Turning to Slide 12. Here, we highlight both the success we've had in gathering core deposits as well as in paying down wholesale funding. The $3 billion of inflows in the last couple of quarters has been used to pay down more than $2.3 billion of wholesale CDs and $850 million of FHLB advances, but there remains a significant and impactful opportunity ahead. Approximately $2 billion of wholesale CDs will come due in 2024, which provides a significant value creation opportunity as we look to convert our deposit pipeline over the next coming quarters. While this opportunity is meaningful, it is important to remind everyone that like most banks, there will always be a place for some level of wholesale funding in our balance sheet. Moving to Slide 13. Our net interest income was $173 million in the fourth quarter. This number is in line with our previous quarter, adjusting for the outsized accretion. Despite the modest reduction in interest earning assets, our net interest margin in the quarter was 3.31%, which exceeded our 3.20% to 3.25% target guide for the quarter and represents 11 basis points of margin expansion on an apples-to-apples basis. We hope to continue this trend of funding mix and cost improvement in '24. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carla to provide additional detail.\nCarla Leibold: Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 14, you can see the trends in our loan portfolio, the yield on loans and our loan-to-deposit ratio. We reduced our loan balances by about $600 million in the fourth quarter as we remain disciplined on loan prices and selectively extending credit and using balance sheet capacity for holistic banking relationships. The consumer held for investment loan portfolio continued to decline, given normal planned runoff while our consumer held-for-sale loan strategy continues to gain momentum. In the fourth quarter, we achieved our $10 million annual run rate goal for fee and fee like income from our held-for-sale program. We expect that to continue in 2024. As a reminder, this fee like income comes with strong credit protection. We have completed our strategic loan portfolio remix and are excited about resuming loan growth. As you will hear from Sam and our 2024 guidance, we have strong conviction in our ability to resume loan growth across the bank and to do so at accretive yields. We will reinvest securities cash flows, excess cash balances and deposit growth this year into new loan originations. Today, our cash and securities are earning roughly the federal funds rate. Once deployed into loans, that liquidity will generate approximately 300 basis points of additional yield based on recent origination trends. We have an enviable loan-to-deposit ratio compared to our regional bank peers, given the success and continued momentum of our core deposit generating initiatives. Our strong liquidity position provides us the flexibility to generate holistic relationship based loan growth without significantly increasing the overall size of the balance sheet. Moving to Slide 15. We are pleased to report another quarter of core noninterest expenses in line with our guidance. Like many banks our size and those much larger, we incurred a special assessment from the FDIC as a result of the banking failures in early 2023. Our onetime expense associated with this special assessment was close to $4 million and was fully accrued in the fourth quarter. Our core noninterest expense to average assets remains best-in-class at 1.67%. Our core efficiency ratio also remained strong at 47%, which was in line with our third quarter ratio after adjusting for the outsized accretion in that period. We will discuss our forward expectations later in the presentation, but I want to provide a few points of commentary right now. We committed significant resources during 2023 to find expense optimization opportunities that we can redeploy to create customer satisfaction and shareholder value. Importantly, none of these expense reduction opportunities will take away from client facing positions, risk management and compliance or critical technology investments. In fact, these are the areas we plan to enhance even further by redeploying savings. Many of our anticipated expense savings will come from items like contract negotiation, vendor optimization and reduction in outside service utilization. On Slide 16, we continue to operate with robust levels of liquidity as evidenced by more than 200% of immediately available liquidity to uninsured deposits. Total overall liquidity remained strong at $11.4 billion at year end 2023. During the fourth quarter, we redeemed $340 million of callable Federal Home Loan Bank advances, which had a cost of close to 6%. We also sold $295 million of securities at roughly book value. The combination of these two actions had a positive impact on our capital levels and will have a positive impact on margin going forward. On Slide 17, we highlight a very important component of shareholder value, growth and tangible book value per share. In 2023 alone, we grew tangible book value per share by an impressive 22% to $47.61. We also have $4.34 of AOCI marks that will be recovered into tangible book value per share going forward. We expect to recover about $1.50 of that in 2024. The 22% growth in tangible book value per share in 2023 compares favorably to our regional bank peers that generated 13% growth. Our longer term track record is even more differentiated. If you look over the past five years, we've generated a compounded annual growth rate of 15% while our regional bank peers have generated only 4% growth. We believe we are among the best in the industry on this metric. Based on our current outlook for earnings and recovery of AOCI in 2024, we also expect to end 2024 with more than $55 of tangible book value per share. I'll also point out that our tangible book value and GAAP book value are virtually the same. Turning to Slide 18. Our TCE ratio ended the fourth quarter at over 7%, which was an increase of 50 basis points in a single quarter and over 100 basis points in the last two quarters. AOCI continues to negatively impact this ratio by about 64 basis points. Our estimated CET1 ratio ended the fourth quarter at 12.2%, which was an increase of 260 basis points for 2023. Adjusted for AOCI, this ratio was 11.2%, which is top quartile among banks with an asset size between $10 billion and $100 billion. The improvement in our CET1 ratio of 260 basis points is among the top 5% of all publicly traded US banks during 2023. In 2023, we executed successfully on our goals and significantly improved our capital levels. Given the continued uncertainty in the market, we feel it is prudent to continue to maintain higher levels of capital going forward. On Slide 19, credit quality in our portfolio remains strong across all metrics. Non-performing loans ended the fourth quarter at $27 million and our nonperforming asset ratio was just 13 basis points. Net charge-offs overall came in line with our expectations. Commercial net charge-offs remain at very low levels and consumer net charge-offs remain within our modeled expectations. Our provision expense of $13.4 million came in well below expectations in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the reduction in loan balances held for investment, which benefited provision expense by roughly $6 million. Absent this, provision would have been in line with our previous estimates. Our reserve level in dollars declined modestly quarter-over-quarter given the lower loan balances I just discussed. We feel we are well reserved at a coverage ratio of 114 basis points of total loans held for investment, which increased 2 basis points during the fourth quarter. We remain extremely well positioned for the potential challenges ahead for the commercial real estate market. The office and retail sectors of commercial real estate each only account for approximately 1% of our total loan portfolio and continue to perform well. With that, I'll pass the call back to Sam to discuss our outlook for 2024 and some concluding remarks.\nSam Sidhu: Thank you, Carla. Turning to Slide 20. We wanted to provide you our outlook for 2024. We've broken our guidance into three categories. Firstly, our financial targets. These metrics included ROA, efficiency ratio and net interest margin. You will note that as opposed to providing specific expense guidance, we will manage the business to an attractive efficiency ratio. We believe this provides us the flexibility to make investments if we see meaningful positive operating leverage. Secondly, from a growth outlook perspective. Our deposit growth story in '24 will be focused on continuing and building off of the success we achieved in 2023. Modest growth in overall balances with a focus on bringing in more high quality deposits will allow us to further reduce wholesale funding. We expect loan growth to resume in 2024. We're seeing attractive opportunities across our franchise led by our national corporate businesses. The strength of our capital and liquidity position provides us the ability to book 10% to 15% loan growth. As we mentioned previously, we anticipate this will be funded with securities and cash in '24 as opposed to meaningfully increasing the overall size of our balance sheet. These efforts should allow us to generate PPNR growth between 10% to 15% in '24 after adjusting for the PPP, NII and Q3 outsized accretion income. Number three, operating assumptions. Our operating assumptions are consistent with what we disclosed with you over the course of the year. We will target a CET1 ratio of about 11.5% and a TCE ratio of about 7.5%. Our tax rate is expected to be between 22% and 24%. With that, I'd like to finish on Slide 21 with some concluding perspectives. This was another incredibly strong quarter and year that we're very proud of at Customers Bank. I'll mention again, we generated over $3 billion of core deposit growth in the last three quarters alone, significantly improving and transforming the quality of our deposit franchise. Continuing to improve our deposit franchise remains our top priority in '24 and we are prepared to continue this march with our robust pipeline. Our net interest margin improved substantially over the course of the year and drove higher profitability on a more liquid and better capitalized balance sheet. Our industry is looking to reach a NIM trough by the middle of this year, while we achieve that in 2022 and have increased since then. We attained our goal to build capital at an extraordinary pace due to strong organic earnings generation and a relatively flat and optimized balance sheet. Our credit quality remains exceptional, but we will stay vigilant in monitoring our portfolio. Our business model is highly focused on risk management and our ability to perform in all macroeconomic environments. With our differentiated and now deposit led business model and the strategic opportunities ahead of us, we believe we are very well positioned for success in the years to come. With that, I'd like to open the call to any questions you may have.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Hal Goetsch from B. Riley Securities.\nHal Goetsch: Congratulations on a terrific year and quarter. The loan growth guidance is simply an outlier and pretty terrific in this environment. Can you give us a feel for the areas or industries that are contributing to this growth? And if I could ask one follow-up on expense growth, it's been flat for the last three quarters. And what can we expect for expense growth in 2024?\nSam Sidhu: Really appreciate it, and welcome officially and formally. So firstly, to focus on the loan growth and the loan portfolio. 2024 is going to be a year of franchise enhancing loan growth as we replace the nonstrategic assets we removed beginning in the first quarter, accelerated in the second quarter of the year with a capital call, nonstrategic line sales and then the runoff that we've targeted in the second half of the year, which has also helped us build our capital levels. So really bilateral and in many cases deposit rich customers, which include venture banking, fund finance. We also are expecting contributions from community banking C&I, we also like our fixed rate equipment finance business. But all in all, we're remaining very selective. But with a 72% loan-to-deposit ratio, we have a tremendous amount of flexibility on our balance sheet. So '23 was the year of deposit transformation and '24 is -- that's going to continue in '23, but '24 is really going to be rebuilding the loan book frankly to directionally close to levels that we started at the beginning of 2023. So the pipelines are strong, and hopefully, that answers your question on the growth part of your question. The second question you had was, I believe, on noninterest expense. So I think we've done a really good job. Carla talked about a couple of things. Firstly, we've managed our quarterly number at about $89 million, plus or minus, of core noninterest expense over the last three quarters. She also talked about some operational excellence initiatives with some detail. And really, our focus, as you saw in the guidance slide is going to be managing to an efficiency ratio. And we will continue to focus on trying to drive savings in the core recurring expense base. Having said that, we'll continue to invest wherever we see opportunities. You heard me talk about deposit teams and really, we won't hold back on expenses and reinvesting those savings. However, we will always hold half the governor of that efficiency ratio. So a long way of saying we'll look to -- I think we're sort of at the high 40s right now. We're going to get to the mid-40s in '24 and we'll look to, at a minimum, look to maintain directionally our core expense base, but really driving that revenue growth, which is going to help us get to that efficiency ratio target.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line Casey Haire from Jefferies.\nCasey Haire: So apologies if I missed this, but can you guys -- your NIM guide of [320 to 340], what kind of Fed funds forecast is embedded within that, and what kind of deposit beta are you assuming if you do have cuts in there?\nSam Sidhu: I'm happy to take that. And Carla, feel free to jump in with any clarification that I missed. So the NIM guidance is pretty wide. There's a lot of deposit remixing and loan remix that's happening. You also heard me talk about the deposit side, the $2 billion plus or minus more of wholesale CDs that are maturing in '24. So really, the high end of the range we would sort of assume cuts that would be more in line with the Fed dot plot but you could have faster loan originations that happened earlier in the year as opposed to middle to later part of the year. And it could assume higher pace and faster pace of deposit inflows at lower cost earlier in the year versus later. And then the inverse really on the lower end of the range. So the range, to be clear, is about 3 to 6 cuts depending on the market and the Fed dot plot. So on the lower end of the range would be higher and faster cuts and really the inverse of what I just described.\nCasey Haire: So 3, 6 cuts, 6 cuts would -- I would assume, get you to that [323] would be to the higher end of [340]. And then just underneath that, what kind of -- like the deposit beta, like on the first\u2026\nSam Sidhu: Yes, it's embedded -- it's really embedded in the guidance. The way to think about deposit betas on the way up, we had a high deposit beta, which really impacted us in '22, but really tapered off in '23. And in fact, we peaked in the first quarter of last year. High deposit beta, high cost of funds benefits you on the way down, and we expect a high beta on the way down.\nCasey Haire: And just lastly, on your -- the deposit remix, so $2.2 billion of wholesale CDs maturing this year. First off, what is the rate on those maturities? And then if I'm doing the math correctly, it looks like you've got core deposits up $1.5 billion to $2 billion. And if all-in deposits are growing low single digits, there's going to be some rollover of that $2 billion. Just wanted to make sure that's correct.\nSam Sidhu: So overall, we'll look to remix most, if not all of that and with core deposit growth. It really depends on the overall pipeline and mix. The cost of that in this year is actually pretty close to 5%. So there's a tremendous opportunity from a cost of funds perspective. So hopefully -- one of the things I did mention is that we're down to about 18% of wholesale CDs from our peak a couple of quarters ago. Our business model is branch light so there's always going to be a place for some portion of wholesale funding in our balance sheet, and we'll look to be thoughtful about recasting any small portion of that over the course of the year. But again, most, if not all of that, we'd look to remix through the course of the year with core deposits.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Winter from D.A. Davidson.\nPeter Winter: I wanted to ask about the balance sheet sensitivity. I mean as of 3Q, the balance sheet is fairly asset sensitive. So I'm just wondering were you able to reduce any of that sensitivity in the fourth quarter, and what's the plan on trying to reduce some of that in '24?\nSam Sidhu: So a high rate environment should be most challenging for a bank like us, given that we don't have the retail network. However, we noted that with the deposit trends and really the positive mix shift into noninterest bearing lower cost deposit over the course of last year. The down rate is going to be beneficial to us from an asset sensitivity perspective, as you know, there are limitations from a shock perspective and a spot perspective in the sense that our K is going to be out in a couple of weeks. But even if you look at our September 30th numbers, noninterest bearing deposit growth increases your asset sensitivity. However, rolling off of fixed rate wholesale CDs into floating rate deposits decreases your asset sensitivity. So we're very prepared for declining rates and while we're moderately slightly asset sensitive. Today, the shock that you'll sort of see in those types of financials is not necessarily representative of how we will actually operate in a gradually declining rate environment, which is what we and the market overall expect directionally, whether it's 3 or 6 to be determined.\nPeter Winter: And then just how do we think about average earning assets from fourth quarter level? I mean positive outlook on the loans, but funded with excess cash and securities cash flows. Just how do we think about the average earning asset growth rate?\nSam Sidhu: So I think I talked about the 10% to 15% growth rate. If you take the midpoint of that range, it really you can sort of directionally see you're getting back to 12/31/22 in terms of our directional loan balances, that earning asset mix shift is really going to be coming from cash and securities as opposed to any changes in the balance sheet. So you can sort of think of the average earning assets as moderately flattish. I'd also mention that I think we've disclosed our securities portfolio is somewhere in the low to mid 5% range on a blended basis. Our cash, as you can probably appreciate, is generating something directionally similar. And our incoming loan yields are typically, especially for some of our national corporate businesses, which is where greater than 50% of the expected growth is planned to come from, it sort of gives you an extra 300 basis points plus or minus spread above what those earning assets are currently yielding.\nPeter Winter: Just my last question. You guys are in some of these businesses of the failed banks last year and then you, of course, bought Signature's venture capital banking portfolio from the [FDIC]. Are you seeing a lot of opportunities to add more bankers to the platform?\nSam Sidhu: Yes, Peter, it's a great question. I think you sort of heard me talk about market share gains and the hundreds of billions of impacted customer deposits and loans from the failed institutions. I think that what's important about our business is we haven't added any new business lines or new business verticals. We happen to have a lot of high quality low risk high growth opportunity, commercial verticals at our bank existing today. From a lending perspective, we have very strong lenders across the franchise. From a deposit perspective, I think you're absolutely right, there will be opportunities for us to find teams and individual performers in motion because clients are in motion. Clients have already changed banks once or twice in the past 12 months and folks are looking to find high quality commercial oriented platforms like ourselves to be able to port into.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Perito from KBW.\nMichael Perito: So obviously, the guide for '24 is pretty thorough. I just had a couple of high level questions, I'd love some color on if that's all right. Number one is just you guys are pretty clear and laid out the remixing opportunities for '24. But I was wondering if you could go a layer deeper just on the mindset around balance sheet growth. Like what are the pieces of the equation when that comes back into consideration in more earnest? Is it a certain capital level, is it a certain amount of liquidity remixing or deposit mix when you guys will start to consider growing the balance sheet? I realize it's not '24 consideration, but just as we look out to '25 and maybe even '26 in the next quarter or two. Just trying to get a better sense of your thought process around when balance sheet growth might and could resume.\nSam Sidhu: So firstly, starting from a capital perspective. We hit our minimum target of 7% by the end of the year, which was really important to us. We expect in the first half of the year, we would hope to achieve at least a 7.5% TCE. I think from a regulatory capital perspective, we've more than cleared and gotten to top quartile levels. We think it's important to be at that 7.5% type range. Focusing on the inside of the balance sheet for a time period and then I'll address the latter part of your question sort of a bit of more of a medium to longer term cast. From a loan growth perspective, I think we've pretty much covered that from sort of a transfer of cash and securities to loans within the asset side of the balance sheet. From a deposit perspective, while we're top quartile or top decile and all the other most important profitability and balance sheet metrics, I think from a self awareness perspective, from a deposit side, we're still on the higher end. And we'd like to continue to improve the mix and reduce the cost and the cost sensitivity of those deposit customers over the course of the coming quarters and years, and that's really what our focus is going to be on. You heard me talk about deposit led growth. I think the real differentiator for Customers Bank today is the customers and the teams that are in motion that are going to really help us enter 2025 and beyond are going to help us build deposits first internally and then a deposit led growth in '25 and beyond, maintaining our current capital goals, which we hope to achieve pretty quickly.\nMichael Perito: And then just you mentioned the expense guide kind of shifting to the efficiency ratio would give you guys flexibility to invest where you see opportunities. Just was wondering if you could maybe spend a minute, not that you guys need more because you've obviously been very busy and done very well. But what initiatives or what does that mean? Like what are you going to look to invest in, is it new business lines, is it just adding more people in the business lines you've added over the last two years? Just would love another layer deeper on that as we think once again about the kind of forward outlook and growth opportunities?\nSam Sidhu: Our reinvestment for the near to medium term is really going to be focused on continuing to build out the infrastructure from -- you heard about sort of treasury management, marketing, a lot of the support functions that allow us to have the breadth of products and services, generate fee income, enhance the customer experience. Those could also sort of bleed into sort of technology and other AI type initiatives, which will help enhance the customer experience and customer service. But the real focus from a true material sort of noninterest expense perspective is going to be on people that help us service and acquire new customers really focus on those deposit customers.\nMichael Perito: So you think the biggest area for investment will probably be growth facing people as you guys continue to scale infrastructure.\nSam Sidhu: It's absolutely right. Yes, there's a lot of folks that have had logos on their business cards changed in the past nine months, and there's a lot of folks that have elected to change the logos in their business cards who are now looking to change again.\nMichael Perito: And then just one last one for me. Just would love a minute on kind of where you guys are at on the technology road map. I mean, any kind of internal investments in your core or other capabilities? Just not really kind of an earnings impactful question necessarily. I'm sure it's baked into your budget and efficiency ratio guide. But just would love any flavor you can give on where you guys are spending some money on on the technology and infrastructure side?\nSam Sidhu: So I think that we're always looking to streamline and improve the effectiveness of our technology platform. We were one of the first banks going back seven or eight years ago to invest in middleware that sits on top of our legacy core. We are probably on the third iteration of that today and continue to enhance it. We're also, in the midst of -- again, this is not something that is required a kind of investment because we have the people at our institution. We have developers. We have API developers. We have a lot of experts who have come from both big and small institutions who can help us continue to enhance our technology platform, but we're really looking to rewire and rearchitect things that sit even above and below the middleware. And we're happy to share some more information on that over time. Again, it's not requiring investment but it's really going to enhance and streamline the way that we look to port in and add new technology providers and also how we currently service our customers. So that's one. Again, similarly, on some of the now, I guess, more legacy type software providers like a Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) or nCino we\u2019re multiple years into probably second or third contract negotiations. And whenever those come up, which come up in the next sort of 12 months or so, we typically look to pivot and reset and use that as an opportunity to redesign and think about what we've learned over the past couple of years, think about sort of the new business lines. And in many cases, what's really interesting is some of the new team members that we bring on have different ways of doing things that we can sort of export to the rest of our organization in a very positive way. So hopefully, that gives you a bit of flavor. I touched on AI as well. And these are the types of things that are very low stakes, test cases that we continue to expand upon exploring across the organization. But again, these are all things to enhance the customer experience and to streamline operations. Nothing that's requiring a tremendous amount of investment. But what's important is that we truly are at the cutting edge of thinking about these types of investments and initiatives.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Moss from Raymond James.\nSteve Moss: Sam, on the deposit pipeline here, just curious if you give a little color on the underlying mix whether there's a mix shift this quarter here and just so what you're thinking is roughly the average cost of those deposits as they're expected to come on?\nSam Sidhu: So just to sort of recap, I think I mentioned this earlier, it was broad based across the franchise. This is a $1.1 billion of core deposit growth, not dissimilar at all to last quarter. We had almost 220 of our deposit channels that saw good growth and these channels had growth of $25 million or more individually, which really sort of helps put a pin in the broad based nature and the quality of the growth. About a third, to put it with more specificity came from private client groups in New York, about a third came from our financial institutions group and the balance was more broadly spread across the organization. So it's a little bit of a shift from -- towards more of our private client groups versus last quarter, which was more focused on the Venture Banking Group because of the migration of the portfolio at the end of the second quarter that really brought in those customers in the third quarter. But I think what's more relevant is to just to zoom out and focus on the $3 billion over the past couple of quarters for a second, because I think that really puts color on the total transformation. So about a quarter of that came from our private client groups, 15% to 20% came from the Venture Banking Group, 20% from our financial institutions group and the balance was spread across the organization like fund finance, commercial real estate, equipment finance, consumer and others. So it's also worth mentioning, as we added $3 billion of core deposits, we also increased our noninterest bearing deposits by about $1 billion over the same time period. So hopefully, that gives you color on where the deposit growth came from. The pipeline is very similar. So I don't need to sort of rehash it. But I think on the venture side, the team was more on transitioning customers in the third quarter. Fourth quarter was outgoing business development and we're going to start to see the customer growth after a foundational quarter in sort of the first half of this year. I think you also asked about rate. So all in rates when accounting for the noninterest bearing balances are coming in not so dissimilar to last quarter in sort of that mid 3% range right now. So I think that we're optimistic. We're getting close to an inflection point in the interest rate hiking cycle. So hopefully, this is where things will continue. Having said that, I think it's very important to note, we're not going to miss market share opportunities by standing on ceremony, especially given all of this dislocation here. So if we need to bring in true primary customer relationships and have a portion of those deposits to be at market rates, we won't shy away from that.\nSteve Moss: And then a similar question on the loan growth side here. You mentioned the VC fund finance, community bank C&I and equipment as drivers of loan growth. Just kind of curious, do you do like fund finance and community bank as the primary drivers relative to VC and [fund] finance? Just how do we kind of think about that mix and the opportunities you see?\nSam Sidhu: So in terms of originations, I think you hit the nail on the head. It's really it's fund finance, venture banking, equipment finance, healthcare, on the corporate side and then community banking really will be on the sort of the more traditional C&I and nothing really to report on CRE. What's worth noting on venture banking is, as you can appreciate, these lines are typically not like, say, a fund finance line where their average -- typically average outstandings are hovering within a tight range. So you have a sense of what a commitment leads to in terms of outstanding. These are typically slow draws. So we may have originations and that also helps to be the catalyst to bring over deposit relationships, but we don't expect draws and outstandings really in the first half of the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Frank Schiraldi from Piper Sandler.\nFrank Schiraldi: Just as you talk about maintaining higher levels of capital here in the near term, and you mentioned, I think, 11.5% CET1 assumed for 2024. Just curious if what you think the right level for the bank is longer term, is the TCE ratio a bit of a governor on that or any sort of targets maybe when things calm down a bit and a little more certainty in the marketplace where you think the right level of capital is?\nSam Sidhu: So from a CET perspective, I think we had set an ambitious goal at the beginning of the year of 11%, 11.5%, which we crossed and really got to top quartile from a regulatory capital perspective in the third quarter. TCE, as you rightfully noted, has really been our governing constraining capital level, which we've gotten to sort of what I would call the minimum of a target range and expect in the near term in the next quarter or two to be at that 7.5% plus type range. And that gives us flexibility if we do feel that deposit growth is -- deposit mix is more or less complete and deposit growth could potentially lead to balance sheet growth, but that's not something we expect in the next couple of quarters. So I think 7.5% feels like the right target from a TCE perspective. So as we think about going off of there and sort of casting a bit more of a longer term range, I think we've always talked about a broad range of 7% to 8%. I think now that we're talking about a minimum level of wanting to get to that 7.5%, I feel like that is going to be our more medium term target. Our organic capital generation has really ramped up and we expect to continue to operate within that sort of minimum range.\nFrank Schiraldi: And then I believe you're just under 20% total brokered at this point deposits. And it sounds like given maturities over the next 12 months that probably should fall below 10%. Just curious if there's any sort of a hard line in terms of where you want to get below? You mentioned brokered or wholesale is part of the mix for a bank going forward. So just curious on that front.\nSam Sidhu: Yes, we're at 17% today or as of 12/31 and declining even further. So I think we're more or less at the level where we would have targeted that we wanted to get to. I think even getting -- building off further from here, it's really going to be dependent on core deposit growth. So I do think that we'll continue to make significant headway as the year progresses, getting closer to that 10% plus or minus range. There's no immediate target. There are benefits and I think the bias and stigma for any bank for some portion of wholesale contractual insured CDs as part of an overall funding base and funding strategy, especially for a commercial oriented nonretail branch based bank makes sense. It's something we'll continue to evaluate over time. I don't have a specific number for you in mind but do feel that we're going to continue to significantly reduce even from the 17% we have today.\nFrank Schiraldi: And then just on the -- sorry if I missed it, but on [CBIT] deposits, in the past, you've talked to think about a 15% max sort of from a standpoint of concentration. Is that kind of where these are sitting now? And then as you think about core deposit generation, how do you think about it, is this still core? I mean, obviously, if we get some rate contraction that could become a little less attractive in the near term unless you move to a fee model. So just curious where those are and how you're thinking about that business longer term?\nSam Sidhu: So the answer to your first question is, yes, we have and continued to. And frankly, it's been very, very stable. So $2.2 billion, plus or minus, again in the quarter, so on an average deposit perspective, so that's constant for three quarters in a row. So we're managing it very well and also managing it well with our customers and holding those in cash. On a longer term basis, we'll continue to evaluate as rates evolve. We're in discussions with customers, we're providing business critical services to customers and holding operating accounts where those customers cannot necessarily fully operate without the technology we are providing. So I think we feel very privileged to be in that type of position. Our customers are very privileged to be working with us. Over time, as rates decline, we're really at a significant NIM at today's rates. And so there's several hundred basis points before that would necessarily be below our NIM average. And there are different things that we're exploring and including fees over time that we'll continue to evaluate. But we're not really holding any excess funds there, these are truly sort of payment services and operating accounts at current levels.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Breese from Stephens Inc.\nMatthew Breese: Just looking at loan growth guidance for the year implies kind of a rough figure $1.6 billion. I know you talked about coming from cash and securities. Could you break down for us how much do you expect to come from cash and how much from securities?\nSam Sidhu: I'll give you sort of rough directional numbers, Matt, just sort of based on maturity schedules and cash flow amortization. It's typically going to be in that range of $600 million to $800 million that's going to come from the securities book and the balance would come from cash. And we're at a 72% loan-to-deposit ratio today even with sort of thinking about the high end of the range would still be have a seven handle below 80% or below from a loan-to-deposit ratio. So hopefully, that gives you some governors and some framework to think about that.\nMatthew Breese: That's great, that's what I mean there. And then going to the NIM, it sounded like the pipeline's blended yield is in that kind of [350] range, it's not too dissimilar from where we are now. Is that [350] a good proxy for where we might see peak deposit costs in '24 and when do you expect that to occur?\nSam Sidhu: So I think you sort of heard me reference, we're sort of at that overall inflection point from a deposit perspective. We also talked about the wholesale CDs continuing to decline. I think it's worth mentioning that from a growth perspective, you also heard me say that we're not going to be imprudent about taking market share. Our interest expense can and should continue to decline even before rate cuts. So yes, while the output of a cost of interest bearing deposits may change, the deposit mix is really going to be the main driver of ups and downs. Interest expense should be maintained and ideally, it should trend downwards on the sort of flattish type deposit base. So we feel privileged to be in this type of a trend and we feel confident in sort of our deposit pipeline and backlog.\nMatthew Breese: And then two other quick ones. The first one is just in regards to the specialty lending balances were down around $400 million this quarter. And I was curious, what was the driver of that, what happened there and expectations for that kind of line item for 2024?\nSam Sidhu: As I mentioned before, it was sort of targeted. These were lower margin, slightly below 300 basis points, 250 plus or minus type spread. From that to particular business line from the specialty, it was within our Fund Finance business, specifically focused on our Lender Finance business. These loans were really rolled off in late December. We'd sort of planned for them and did -- and opted and elect not to renew. So nonstrategic from a business line as well as a customer relationship perspective, nonstrategic from a deposit perspective and nonstrategic primacy of relationship perspective. So hopefully, that gives you some color. And we'll look to -- that gives us sort of more opportunity to refill that with more strategic loan growth in the year.\nMatthew Breese: And then the last one was just appreciating that credit metrics were solid. NPAs are basically flat at 14 bps or 13 bps. I did see that substandard loans increased about 20% quarter-to-quarter. And I was curious what happened there, and is there anything worth mentioning?\nPhil Watkins: So yes, the substandards did increase, but it's actually really related to a single credit that migrated in the portfolio. And it's worth noting on that, that we actually have 100% coverage of the loan amount in cash from the borrower at the bank. So it's a bit of a unique situation. And since the quarter, there's actually been some positive developments on that credit as well. So we wouldn't be surprised to see that reupgrade during the quarter. So really not anything that we're worried about.\nMatthew Breese: Just curious, what was the loan tied to in terms of commercial versus real estate consumer?\nSam Sidhu: It was something our commercial finance -- equipment finance business. So again, it's a large relationships, $60 million plus. I don't know the exact number and it's 100% backed by cash.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Dezellem from Tieton Capital Management.\nBill Dezellem: So relative to your guidance about loan demand, given that that's a bit unusual for the industry right now. Would you talk to us about what you've seen in terms of loan demand changes or trends over the last four months or so, please?\nSam Sidhu: So two major things to highlight that I haven't already covered on the call today. Firstly is that our lending teams have been sitting on their hands for the past 12 to 15 months really. And I think that there's a lot of pent-up demand from existing customer relationships, even when not taking into account new opportunities. That's amplified by there being now fewer competitors in many of our national corporate verticals, which I've sort of highlighted what the components of those are earlier on the call. So the combination of the pent-up demand plus fewer competition and our sort of focus on these national low credit risk verticals, it's not a stretch for us. And because we were targeted in reducing our nonstrategic assets, it's really just getting our portfolio back to where it was 12 months ago. So it's not a stretch and it's all relative to our size and the business lines that we're focused on.\nBill Dezellem: And then have you seen that loan demand change and get stronger over the last four months or basically, the demand has been there, you just have -- your bankers have just been in a holding pattern?\nSam Sidhu: Over the last three to four months, it really hasn't changed much. It's just been that our discipline has been on making sure we focus on capital and having a very strong base to build off of. So I haven't seen a material change. And I think what's also important to note is we're not CRE dependent like many of our peers, and I think that's really helping to benefit us in the sense that we have a broader, more C&I commercial oriented base that's helping to source this input.\nBill Dezellem: And I know we're running a little long here, but one final question. Long term, not in 2024 but beyond, how are you thinking about the loan-to-deposit ratio, what's the range that you find as a comfortable place to settle into?\nSam Sidhu: So I think I talked about between sort of where we are in 80% plus or minus for this year, likely sort of staying in the sort of the mid to high 70s. Longer term, we've been sitting on very prudent cash balances, and part of that is by nature of the events of March of last year. Longer term, where we used to be at 120% in 2018, mostly driven by some of our focus on our Mortgage Warehouse business, which we felt comfortable and sort of given the short duration and liquid nature of that portfolio and going to the higher end of the overall peer group. We feel probably more in the mid 80 range, feels like a more medium term, but it's something we'll continue to communicate about in the coming 12 to 24 months.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Sam Sidhu, I turn the call back over to you for some final closing remarks.\nSam Sidhu: Thanks so much, everyone. We really appreciate your continued interest in and support of Customers Bank. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thanks so much, and have a great day and a great weekend.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

        "article_content": " \n\nWSFS Financial Corporation (NASDAQ: WSFS) has delivered a robust performance in the fourth quarter of 2023, with the company's full-year core earnings per share at $4.55 and a core return on tangible common equity of 22.48%. \nThe bank has seen substantial customer deposit and loan growths, alongside an increase in core fee revenue. WSFS anticipates continued growth in 2024 with a projected core return on assets of around 1.20% and double-digit fee revenue growth, despite not planning for interest rate cuts. \nWSFS Financial Corporation's recent performance paints a picture of a company with strong fundamentals and a positive outlook. The InvestingPro data underscores this narrative with some key metrics that align with the company's reported growth and strategic positioning for the year ahead.\nThe company's market capitalization stands at a healthy $2.78 billion, showcasing its substantial size within the financial sector. This is complemented by a low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 9.85, which, when adjusted for the last twelve months as of Q3 2023, sits at an even more attractive 9.77. This indicates that WSFS's stock may be undervalued relative to its near-term earnings growth, a sentiment echoed by one of the InvestingPro Tips, which notes the company is trading at a low P/E ratio relative to this growth. Investors looking for value may find WSFS an appealing option.\nAnother metric that stands out is the company's PEG ratio, which at 0.21 for the last twelve months as of Q3 2023, suggests that the stock could be undervalued based on its earnings growth projections. This ratio is particularly useful for investors who are looking for growth at a reasonable price.\nMoreover, WSFS has demonstrated a strong return over the last three months, with a price total return of 33.71%. This performance is indicative of the market's positive reception to the company's strategies and financial results. Additionally, the company has raised its dividend for 10 consecutive years and has maintained dividend payments for 26 consecutive years, reinforcing its commitment to returning value to shareholders.\nFor investors seeking further insights and tips on WSFS, InvestingPro offers a wealth of additional information.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to your host for today, Mr. Art Bacci, Interim Chief Financial Officer. Sir, you may begin.\nArt Bacci: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you again for joining our fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. Our earnings release and earnings release supplement, which we will refer to on today's call, can be found in the Investor Relations section of our company website. With me on this call are Rodger Levenson, Chairman, President, and CEO; Steve Clark, Chief Commercial Banking Officer; and Shari Kruzinski, Chief Consumer Banking Officer. Before I turn the call over to Roger for his remarks on the quarter, I would like to read out our safe harbor statement. Our discussion today will include information about our management's view of our future expectations, plans, and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from historical results or those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risk factors included in our annual report on Form 10-K and our most recent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, as well as other documents we periodically file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All comments made during today's call are subject to the safe harbor statement. I will now turn the call over to Roger.\nRodger Levenson: Thank you, Art, and everyone else, for joining us on the call today. WSFS performed very well in the fourth quarter, as we continued to demonstrate the strength and diversity of our business model. These results capped a successful 2023 with full year core earnings per share of $4.55, core return on tangible common equity of 22.48%, and a core return on assets of 1.38%. Each of these metrics exceeded 2022 levels. Highlights for the quarter and full year included: Customer deposit growth of 3% linked quarter or 13% annualized. Growth occurred across our Wealth and Trust, Commercial and Consumer businesses. Deposit mix remained strong with 31% of average deposits in non-interest demand accounts. Loan growth of 1% linked quarter or 3% annualized. Full year customer deposit and loan growth of 2% and 7%, respectively, with the year-end loan-to-deposit ratio of 77%. Core net interest margin of 3.99% for the quarter, with interest-bearing deposit beta at 44%. Core fee revenue growth of 6% linked quarter. Growth was driven by Wealth and Trust, Cash Connect, and Capital Markets businesses. Full year core fee revenue growth of 10% and core fee revenue ratio of 30.4% in the fourth quarter. The core efficiency ratio was 54.5% for the quarter, which included several favorable one-time adjustments of approximately $4 million for estimated incentive and employee benefit accruals. Excluding these adjustments, the core efficiency ratio would have been 56.2%. Asset quality remained stable. Net charge-offs and problem loans were essentially flat to Q3, and NPAs ticked up 8 basis points. The balance sheet remains strong with ACL coverage of 1.35% and all capital ratios significantly above well-capitalized levels. In summary, our franchise growth was facilitated by the continued optimization of our investments and highly unique competitive market position. We enter 2024 with strong momentum and look forward to continuing to execute on our 2022 to 2024 strategic plan. I will now turn it back to Art for commentary on our 2024 outlook and to facilitate Q&A.\nArt Bacci: Thank you, Rodger. I will now cover our outlook for 2024. Looking forward to 2024, we expect a full year core return on assets of around 1.20%. Our outlook assumes no interest rate cuts in 2024. This assumption is a different approach from our prior periods, whereby we tied our interest rate outlook to the forward curve. Our analysis demonstrates the forward curve has been a [poor] (ph) indicator of actual interest rate changes. Additionally, recent economic data along with comments from the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank officials have combined to temper market expectations for lower interest rates. We have also assessed our outlook assuming three interest rate cuts totaling 75 basis points, all in the second half of 2024. The impact potentially reduces our net interest margin by approximately 15 basis points in 2024. Further information on our interest rate sensitivity is provided on Slide 10 of the supplement. WSFS' diverse business model provides management with multiple strategies to achieve our previously communicated goal of top-quartile performance. Our favorable market position, a loan-to-deposit ratio of 77%, and consistent cash flows from our securities portfolio enable us to opportunistically fund relationship-based loans in our markets. Our multiple sources of core deposits provide us with favorable deposit cost and funding mix, further contributing to our top-tier net interest margin. Fee income contributes almost one-third of our total revenue. Our fee-based businesses continue to be increasingly integrated with our overall business model and all have significant growth opportunities, because of joint relationships with our commercial and consumer customers, industry consolidation, and potential non-bank M&A activity. I will also point out that gradual declining interest rates potentially enhance our financial results and capital positions than better equity and fixed income market performance, increased mortgage and asset securitization transactions, and higher market valuations of our investment portfolio and tangible book value as demonstrated during the fourth quarter. Net charge-offs are expected to be between 50 basis points and 60 basis points of average loans for the year, primarily driven by Upstart and NewLane, as well as continued normalization of credit trends. Overall, our portfolio credit metrics were stable this quarter, and our ACL coverage ratio is 1.35% of total loans and leases. Excluding the held to maturity securities and including acquisition credit marks, the ACL ratio stands at 1.64% of loans and leases. Further information on our ACL ratio is included on Slide 13 of the supplement. Finally, our strong capital position and earnings enable us to absorb unfavorable developments in the economy, to continue to invest in our franchise, capitalize on market opportunities, and to take steps to further enhance shareholder returns. Thank you, and we will now open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Perito of KBW. Your line is open.\nMichael Perito: Hey guys, good afternoon. Happy New Year. Thanks for taking my questions.\nRodger Levenson: Happy to do it.\nMichael Perito: Obviously, a lot of great extra color around margin and rates in the deck. So, I appreciate that. Just to maybe put some guardrails around it. So I guess first, just looking at Slide 10 here, the '25 cut, the $9.6 million NII impact, so I mean, I guess if we're just thinking kind of pure NIM here, just what kind of sanity check my math, it would seem like every cut, all else equal a static balance sheet kind of moves the 3.80%, 3.90% range down 5 bps, so like 3.75% to 3.85% and so forth is. Would you guys generally agree directionally with that? Or -- and that is incorporating the benefit of the off-balance sheet hedging strategy. Is that all kind of correct, or is there anything that would -- you would change?\nArt Bacci: Mike, I think that's directionally correct. And I would just reiterate, that's an annualized number. So, if rates are going to get reduced in the second half of the year, we clearly wouldn't feel that full impact in 2024.\nMichael Perito: Correct. Yes. Okay. And is that the 3.80% -- I mean does that -- the additional hedges, the $250 million, it says approved for additional floors, would that potentially neutralize that range somewhat, or is that kind of baked into that as well, would you say?\nArt Bacci: No, that's baked into that, because any hedges we would put in would be -- would have to result in significantly lower rates. Today, the $750 million we've done is at about 4% SOFR rate. So, clearly, there have to be a material drop in the SOFR for the hedges to kick in.\nMichael Perito: Got it. That's great. Thank you. And then, switching over to the fee side, obviously, a very strong quarter. A couple of comments in the deck drove my attention. I just love it like a layer deeper on them. With substantial growth opportunity on the Wealth side and then a comment about the Cash Connect and peer consolidation, any -- obviously, you guys have double-digit growth expectations for fees in '24, which is pretty robust. But can you maybe give a few more specifics about where some of those opportunities are coming from and driving that assumption?\nArt Bacci: Sure. So, this is Art again, Mike. One of the things that happened in the fourth quarter -- late third quarter, fourth quarter is one of the largest players in the Cash Connect business exited the market and we've been able to pick up the clientele and we have continued to see inflows through the first and second quarter of 2024 in our pipeline from that situation, which is giving us a high degree of confidence that Cash Connect will continue to have some double-digit growth into 2024 over 2023. And then, on the Wealth side, I mean, the combination of our businesses are seeing very strong pipelines going into 2024. Institutional Trust businesses got a nice pipeline, including almost $100 million of potential deposits that we're looking at. And then, increasingly, our Wealth Management business being integrated with our normal bank business and the referral activity we're seeing from both commercial and consumer banking is really giving us a great opportunity to continue to grow the AUM business as well.\nMichael Perito: That's helpful, Art. Thanks. Just two more quick ones, if I could. It seems like the consumer -- unsecured consumer charge-offs were pretty stable and remain in the range, I think, you guys have communicated. Just any broader commentary there? The data points have been so mixed, right? Like, for example, Discover, who's got a prime unsecured book, saw an uptick in charge-offs and delinquencies. Others have been more stable. We'll get a few more data points next week. But any updated thoughts around the unsecured consumer credit environment, particularly as it relates to your portfolio as we think about '24?\nArt Bacci: Yeah, I mean, I think -- this is Art again. If you strip out Upstart and we've seen the same thing, the charge-offs have been really benign and stable on the unsecured. Upstart been the one area where we've seen higher levels of charge-offs in that. We believe it was tied to some of the earlier cohorts that we booked and that is working its way through the system and we hope that in the first, second quarter that would start to decline. We've also -- we're not really materially adding to the Upstart portfolio. We've hit our concentration limits on unsecured. And so that is basically just replacing some run-off at this point of time, and we will continue to evaluate the charge-off experience, which could lead us to making other decisions.\nMichael Perito: Got it. And then, just lastly, obviously the guide is very helpful in laying out how you guys are thinking about the year. The one thing that was kind of absent is, just any incremental commentary around buybacks. And just -- I know, your model and your approach to it are pretty consistent all the time, but just any updated color or Board conversations that are happening about the buyback would be helpful just as we think about that moving forward.\nRodger Levenson: Hey, Mike, it's Rodger. Nothing's changed with our capital return philosophy. And it's been our historic practice from a forward-looking outlook or for our plan to only put in there the routine buybacks that we use to supplement the dividend. We continue to periodically evaluate potentially higher buyback levels, but as you know, that's dependent upon the forward look of the economy as well as assessment of our balance sheet and where the share price is, because we have a model that targets at least a 16% IRR. So, we'll continue to evaluate that as those factors play out, but nothing different from our ongoing philosophy.\nMichael Perito: Very good. Listen, thanks, guys. I appreciate it. Have a great weekend. Talk to you soon.\nArt Bacci: You too.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Feddie Strickland with Janney Montgomery Scott. Your line is open.\nFeddie Strickland: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Just wanted to start back on the sensitivity analysis for a second. Could there be some level of upside there, just given the fact that that assumes a static balance sheet and you're clearly going to grow loans kind of within your guide? Just trying to think through in a little more detail about what happens with the margin, if we as analysts do assume some level of rate cuts.\nArt Bacci: Sure, Feddie. I do think there is some upside. The position we have today has been consistent. Our asset sensitivity over a long period of time, it certainly has benefited us when rates have gone up. And even through multiple rate cycles, we have consistently put out a top-quintile net interest margin. The opportunities, because we have a lot of levers to pull, kind of exist in a couple of areas. One, some of our betas, if rates were to start to climb, could be better than we anticipate. But right now, our view is that there's still a lot of banks out there with high loan-to-deposit ratios and some liquidity concerns. And so, they're keeping rates higher than maybe we would. And we will -- we have the ability to basically defend our market position and go after those competitors. Secondly, I think that the declining rate environment could very well trigger increased mortgage and other type of asset-backed securitizations, and refinancing of corporate debt, which would give our Institutional Trust business a nice kick in terms of further deposit growth. And a lot of that tends to be non-interest-bearing deposits. So, those are just a couple of levers that could really work to our benefit as 2024 progresses.\nFeddie Strickland: Understood. That makes a lot of sense. And I guess along those same lines, can you remind us of where you feel like DDAs could end up over the next couple of quarters? I think I peg them at about 31% of average deposits today. Does that glide down into the high-20%s or what are your assumptions on the level of noninterest-bearing deposits over time?\nArt Bacci: I think we've got -- the 30% rate targets, probably kind of reflective of normalization for us. And on average, it's been pretty consistent. It might have some volatility from quarter-to-quarter because of the Trust deposits, but when you look at the average, it has been about 30% and that's kind of the pre-pandemic level. So, we feel pretty comfortable that 30% is a good area. And again, if rates decline and market securitization activity picks up, that could increase actually.\nFeddie Strickland: Got it. And then just one last question for me on expenses. I know your guide mentions continued investment in the franchise. Are there any initiatives in particular that could move expenses up more earlier versus later in the year? Any detail you can give on any either technology initiatives or hiring or anything along those lines? What's driving some of those expenses?\nRodger Levenson: Feddie, this is Roger. I don't think there's anything -- one big thing of note, we're continuing to invest in the franchise. So yes, we have a fair number of technology investments that continue, which has been the process that has been going on for several years. And we're looking to hire. And we have some businesses that already have plans for hiring, most of that tied to potential revenue. And we could see more opportunity there if we think it's additive to us to hire folks, as well as something like the small RIA investment that we made in 2023. So, a combination of those things, we're looking to invest and grow the business. We think this is a time to move market share and to invest as others retrench. And that's really -- it's reflected broad based across all of the NIE categories.\nFeddie Strickland: Understood. So, supportive more of long-term growth rather than any particular initiative or new product line or anything like that?\nRodger Levenson: That's an accurate assessment.\nFeddie Strickland: Got it. Thanks so much. I'll step back in the queue.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Russell Gunther with Stephens. Your line is open.\nRussell Gunther: Hey, good afternoon, guys.\nRodger Levenson: Good afternoon.\nRussell Gunther: Art, I appreciate all the margin. Hey, Roger. Art, appreciate the discussion around the NIM. Maybe -- and particularly sensitizing to the three cuts. So, in that scenario, what do you guys assume your deposit beta does on the way down? It sounds like from broader comments you made, you're being conservative there, but curious what's baked into that three cut sensitivity.\nArt Bacci: Well, obviously, if rates start to go down, we would recalibrate our beta. We kind of initially think early on the beta would be fairly low again, because of the competitive environment. We do have opportunities. We have product, money market, products that are tied to an index. So, if the index declines, obviously our rates will go down. We've done some exception pricing, primarily with some sort of public money and commercial money that could be repriced down. But on the consumer side, there continues to be a fair amount of competition in the market. And so, we believe that's probably going to be a slower decline. Now, if that were to change, clearly we could lower our rates. But that's our assumption, is the competitive market will require us to continue to provide some premium on deposits to protect our franchise.\nRussell Gunther: Okay. I appreciate that, Art. And then, if you could just as a follow up, remind us the amount of indexed deposits you have?\nArt Bacci: The amount of indexed deposits is that what you said, Russell?\nRussell Gunther: If you have it.\nArt Bacci: Yeah, we may have to get back to you.\nRussell Gunther: No problem.\nArt Bacci: Primarily in the money market account. Let us get back to you, Russell, on that.\nRussell Gunther: I appreciate that. No problem. And then just last one for me, guys. The '24 outlook, again, with the stable rates, any risk to the fee guide if you were to sensitize to three cuts? I mean, it sounds like the Cash Connect is really a market share gain opportunity, but just thinking through that double-digit target in the three cut scenario as well, how do you see that playing out?\nArt Bacci: I think potentially through rate cuts certainly would increase the value of fixed-income AUM and potentially have an upside in the market, which would increase our AUM. And we're building in like a 3% market-based AUM growth. So that could potentially increase if the markets were to go up. As I mentioned previously, some rate decreases could enhance the securitization market and lead to further corporate debt refinancing, which would benefit our Institutional Trust business.\nRussell Gunther: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you guys for taking my question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Frank Schiraldi with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nFrank Schiraldi: Hey, guys.\nRodger Levenson: Hi, Frank.\nFrank Schiraldi: Just on Cash Connect business, trying to get a sense given the pickup in business here in the fourth quarter and potentially into the current year, is it -- obviously, the double-digit growth year-over-year has got a pretty good starting jumping-off point. But when I think about just growth off of 4Q levels, I mean, is there enough low-hanging fruit where you could see double-digit growth off of 4Q levels in 2024? How are you thinking about growth from here, I guess, for Cash Connect?\nArt Bacci: I think given the volume that's in the pipeline from the providers of ATM services that are moving from that other competitor, there's potential for some low double-digit growth from the fourth quarter.\nFrank Schiraldi: Okay.\nRodger Levenson: I think, Frank the other thing is -- Frank, with the Cash Connect, it's Rodger, with some of this consolidation, also comes some pricing power for us, which could be a tailwind as we pick up some business as well.\nFrank Schiraldi: Okay. Yeah, I was going to ask about returns in that business. The ROA looked like got a pretty good boost. I don't know if that's sustainable, and if you even could see further ROA pick up in 2024, where that business could again be accretive to the bottom-line, ROA?\nRodger Levenson: Yeah. As you know, we've -- and you hit on it. Historically, over time, Cash Connect has been accretive to the overall ROA, and we're getting back to those levels. We went through a period of significant investment in some product and some technology and kind of the maturation of that combined with this opportunity in the traditional bailment business. We're getting some scale and some pricing power, and we think there's every opportunity for us to have it continue to be accretive to overall corporate ROA in the near term.\nArt Bacci: Yeah. Frank, we pretty much saw a bottoming of the ROA in the first quarter this year. And between the first and fourth quarter, the ROA has increased 250%. So, with additional volume being added in the first half of next year, we would expect that ROA to continue to move up.\nFrank Schiraldi: Okay. Great. And then, Art, just on the AUM linked quarter, the growth noted, obviously, a lot of that was market-driven. But just wondering if you have net flows you've seen in AUM from a customer standpoint over the last couple of quarters?\nArt Bacci: Yeah. We saw a little bit more outflow in the fourth quarter. So, we were pretty much break even through the first three quarters, which was a big improvement from prior years because we were still integrating Bryn Mawr Trust and there was a lot of client change and some advisor departures. So, we saw fourth quarter a little bit more departure and some of that just tied to spend where we're seeing customers using up more assets in order to just maintain lifestyle given the higher inflation rate and -- higher rates, whereby they're buying houses and instead of financing and paying all cash.\nFrank Schiraldi: Okay. And then just lastly, sorry if I missed it, but the uptick in NPA is obviously off a pretty low base, but what was -- what drove that primarily?\nSteve Clark: Hey, Frank, this is Steve Clark speaking. That was really two specific loans, one in the multifamily sector. This particular multifamily was master leased to a co-living operator, who declared bankruptcy. So that sponsor is working to reposition that property into more of a traditional multifamily. The other was in our legacy healthcare book, the elder care. Frank, the facility just did not recover from COVID. So, they were the two specific loans, one in multifamily, one in legacy elder care.\nFrank Schiraldi: Okay. And then, are either of those additions still current or these are 90 days past due in NPAs?\nSteve Clark: No, they're both NPAs.\nFrank Schiraldi: Okay. All right. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nArt Bacci: Thanks, Frank.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Manuel Navas with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.\nManuel Navas: Hey, good afternoon. Does the fee guidance include any acquisitions? And would any -- I think you have some interest there. So, would any acquisitions be on fee side be -- would all be additive, correct?\nArt Bacci: Yeah, Manuel, this is Art. Any M&A would be additive. We have not baked in anything into our guidance for M&A.\nManuel Navas: And what's your appetite on the fee side?\nArt Bacci: We continue to look at opportunities, namely across our fee businesses, and we did do the transaction in 2023 and we have a couple of other things we're looking at, but we're just looking at it, nothing definitive, right now.\nManuel Navas: Okay. And there was a little bit of elevated paydown activity in the commercial. Do you have any view on how that continues? And can you just talk about loan growth across the year?\nSteve Clark: Yeah, Manuel, Steve Clark again. So last year, year-over-year, we grew loans across all segments, about 7%. We believe mid-single digit for 2024 is attainable, again across all segments, C&I, CRE, consumer with our Spring EQ partnership, and residential mortgage as we made a strategic decision to hold more on the balance sheet. The focus certainly is still C&I, both in the commercial bank and our small business bank. Elevated payoffs in that C&I segment in the fourth quarter really revolve around three transactions. Totaled, almost $80 million in the hospitality space, two of our sponsors sold their assets and the third refinanced, and that resulted in some unplanned significant reductions in C&I. The rest of the reduction was line activity at year-end with companies clearing out their line of credit balances in preparation for year-end.\nManuel Navas: Thank you. I appreciate that.\nOperator: Your next question is a follow-up from Feddie Strickland with Janney Montgomery Scott. Your line is open.\nFeddie Strickland: Hey, thanks. Just, sorry, I had one quick follow-up. Just wanted to ask about the growth of the balance sheet and earning assets relative to loans. I think it's been -- if my math is right, it's been relatively low, even down a little bit over the last couple of quarters. I mean, should we see the balance sheet continue to stay overall relatively flat or does that start to grow a bit with some of the loan growth?\nArt Bacci: Feddie, this is Art. I would say that the balance sheet would probably remain flat -- generally flat. Remember, we have about $500 million a year, roughly of cash flow coming off the mortgage-backed securities and investment portfolio, which would fund about a 3.5% growth in the loan portfolio. So, the loans would have to really grow significantly in order for us to start to grow the balance sheet.\nFeddie Strickland: Got it. Thanks, Art. That's it from me.\nOperator: Thank you. And with no further questions in queue, I would like to turn the conference back over to Art Bacci.\nArt Bacci: Thank you for joining the call today. If you have any specific follow-up questions, please feel free to reach out to Andrew or myself. Also, Rodger and I will be attending conferences and investor meetings throughout the quarter, and we look forward to meeting with many of you. Have a nice weekend.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor. For more information see our T&C."

For the fourth quarter of 2023, the company reported net sales of $589.1 million, an increase of 19% compared to net sales of $493.6 million for the fourth quarter of last year. The fourth quarter of 2023 revenue included one-time cost recoveries of approximately $5 million. Light vehicle production increased by 6% quarter-over-quarter in the company's primary markets of North America, Europe, Japan and Korea, which equates to a 13% revenue outperformance versus the company's underlying markets. The gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 34.5% compared with a gross margin of 31.2% in the fourth quarter of last year. The increase in gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2023 was positively impacted by recurring price increases to customers and one-time cost recoveries, which together positively impacted the gross margins by approximately 100 basis points on a quarter-over-quarter basis. The additional improvements in gross margin came from the higher sales levels, improved leverage on overhead expenses, purchasing cost reductions, lower inbound freight expenses and improvements in overtime-related costs. The fourth quarter of 2023 produced significant year-over-year gross margin improvements as well as a sequential improvement in gross margin compared to the third quarter of this year. Our team has done an excellent job of working with our customers to execute both temporary and permanent price increases to help offset the inflationary cost environment that has negatively impacted Gentex over the last 2 years. I'm very pleased with the progress we have made in our gross margin recovery plan during 2023. And as we head into 2024, the next phase of our gross margin recovery plan will focus on bill of material reductions, throughput improvements and overtime and scrap cost reductions. The improvements we have made in 2023, combined with our targeted improvements for 2024, provide the road map of how we plan to achieve our target of a 35% to 36% gross margin by the end of the year. Operating expenses during the fourth quarter of 2023 were up 18% to $70.6 million compared to operating expenses of $59.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Operating expenses increased quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to staffing and engineering-related professional fees. As we ramp up our development and launch capabilities, our planned R&D expenses are trending higher but remain in line with our expectations and continue to increase in line with our overall sales growth rates. We are focused on adding technical bandwidth across many different disciplines to help execute the significantly higher number of launches needed to accomplish our recent and forecasted growth. While launch activity has been driving an increase in R&D, we also continue to invest heavily in research activity focused on new products and technical capabilities while also ensuring that the technical team is in place to help drive product redesign that will optimize the cost structure of existing bills of material. We expect our R&D levels to be elevated throughout 2024 as the pace of innovation and launch of new products remains at the highest rate in company history. Income from operations for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $132.8 million compared to income from operations of $94.1 million for the fourth quarter of last year. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the company had an effective tax rate of 13.9%, which was driven by benefits from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, discrete benefits from stock-based compensation as well as provision-to-return adjustments. In the fourth quarter of 2023, net income was $116.9 million compared to net income $86.2 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2023 were $0.50 compared with earnings per diluted share of $0.37 in the fourth quarter of last year. For calendar year 2023, the company's net sales were $2.3 billion, an increase of 20% compared to net sales of $1.92 billion in calendar year 2022, representing the highest annual sales in company history. Light vehicle production in 2023 increased by 12% compared to last year in the company's primary markets. The company's revenue outperformance in 2023 versus the underlying market was driven by growth in FDM and exterior auto-dimming mirror unit shipments as well as continued penetration of base interior auto-dimming mirrors. For calendar year 2023, the gross margin was 33.2% compared to a gross margin of 31.8% for calendar year 2022. Gross margin improved for the year by 140 basis points primarily due to price increases and cost recoveries, lower freight costs, product mix and improved overhead leverage created by the growth in revenue. For calendar year 2023, operating expenses increased 11% to $266.9 million compared to operating expenses of $239.8 million last year. For calendar year 2023, the company's effective tax rate was 15.2% compared to an effective tax rate of 13.8% for calendar year 2022. The increase in the tax rate in 2023 was primarily driven by a reduced benefit from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction compared to last year. Net income for calendar year 2023 was $428.4 million, up 34% compared to net income of $318.8 million last year. Earnings per diluted share for calendar year 2023 were $1.84 compared to earnings per diluted share of $1.36 last year. I'll now hand the call over to Kevin for some financial details.\nKevin Nash: Thanks, Steve. Automotive net sales during the fourth quarter of '23 were $578.7 million compared to $482 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. For calendar year '23, automotive net sales were $2.25 billion, which represents a 20% increase over '22. The increase in automotive net sales was driven primarily by a 45% increase in FDM unit shipments as well as a 21% year-over-year increase in exterior auto-dimming mirror unit shipments. Other net sales in the fourth quarter, which includes dimmable aircraft windows and fire protection products, were $10.5 million, a decrease of 2% compared to other net sales of $10.7 million in the fourth quarter of '22. Fire protection sales decreased by 44% and dimmable aircraft window increased by 362% for the fourth quarter of '23 when compared to the fourth quarter of '22. Other net sales for calendar year '23 were $44.6 million compared with other net sales of $44.2 million in calendar year '22. Fire protection sales in '23 were down 32% year-over-year while dimmable aircraft window sales increased by 211% in '23 compared to last year. Share repurchases. The company repurchased 2.2 million shares of its common stock during the fourth quarter at an average price of $30.76 per share. For the year ended December 31 of '23, the company repurchased 4.93 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $29.61 per share for a total of $144.7 million. As of December 31 of '23, the company has 15.9 million shares remaining available for repurchase pursuant to its previously announced share repurchase plan. The company intends to continue to repurchase additional shares of its common stock in the future in support of the previously disclosed capital allocation strategy. But share repurchases may vary from time-to-time and will take into account macroeconomic issues, market trends and other factors the company deems appropriate. Shifting over to the balance sheet. The balance sheet comparisons mentioned today are as of December 31 of '23 as compared to December 31 of '22. Cash and cash equivalents were $226.4 million compared to $214.8 million. Short-term and long-term investments combined were $313.4 million, up from $225.3 million, which includes fixed income investments as well as the company's equity and cost method investments. Accounts receivable was $321.8 million, up from $276.5 million due to the increase in sales levels. Inventories were $402.4 million, down from $404.4 million, and accounts payable increased to $184.4 million, up from $151.7 million. Let's take a look at preliminary cash flow items for the quarter and year. Fourth quarter 2023 cash flow from operations was $169.6 million, which was an increase from $101.8 million in the fourth quarter of '22. The increase was due to increases in net income, shifts in working capital and deferred taxes. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations was $537.2 million, an increase from $338.2 million in 2022 due to increased net income and changes in working capital. CapEx for the fourth quarter was $62.3 million compared with $37.9 million for the fourth quarter of last year. And calendar year 2023 capital expenditures were $183.7 million compared with $146.4 million last year. And depreciation and amortization for the fourth quarter was $22.3 million compared with $23.3 million for the fourth quarter of last year. And calendar year '23 depreciation and amortization was $93.3 million compared with $96.6 million last year. I'll now hand the call over to Neil for a product update.\nNeil Boehm: Thank you, Kevin. Earlier in January, Gentex participated in the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show. CES is one of the many tools we use to showcase our current and potential future product portfolio to customers and consumers. Our booth was designed to help automakers envision a path toward the autonomous age with scalable products and features ready for implementation on today's vehicles. This year, we had two different booths where we demonstrated Gentex technology. One of the booths, which was located in the North Hall, showcased our newly announced acquisition of eSight, the medical wearable for people with vision loss. This booth was set up to allow partners and consumers the ability to experience this great technology. And it showed Gentex' capability and experience in displays and cameras applied in a new market segment. Our primary booth was in the West Hall and was focused on our automotive, aerospace and consumer-facing products and technologies. This booth contained multiple vehicles and simulators, which were designed to demonstrate new features and technologies to visitors, enabling them to experience the first-hand benefits of our products right on the show floor. One of the unique demonstrators showcased a scalable yet holistic approach to driver and in-cabin monitoring. The driver monitoring system tracked the driver's head pose, eye gaze and other relevant movements to determine distraction, drowsiness, sudden sickness and readiness for the return of manual control in semiautonomous vehicles. The system is easily expandable to include 2D or 3D cabin monitoring for detecting passengers, behaviors, objects and even presence of life. Our goal with this system is to provide solutions for today's vehicles and the transition to autonomous vehicle, which means engineering a comprehensive and scalable monitoring platform based on our competency in digital vision and sensor fusion techniques. A second demonstrator was set up to demonstrate the value and use cases for thermal imaging using long-wave infrared technology. Gentex previously announced our partnership with ADASKY, whose focus is on thermal imaging. At CES, we showcased a simulator that we developed together that highlighted the value that thermal imaging can bring to both forward and rearward vision systems in a vehicle. To demonstrate a forward-facing thermal imager, we showed how this information could be displayed in the center stack or any display in the dash of a vehicle to help a driver or passengers see under difficult conditions. For the rearward-facing thermal imager, we showcased how this information could be displayed in our Full Display Mirror in order to provide additional visibility benefits to the consumer in difficult driving conditions. Additionally, we demonstrated how a thermal imager can be utilized as an additional sensor input into ADAS systems for really difficult driving situations such as heavy fog, low light, very bright light, snow and rain. Also displayed at CES were our large-area dimmable devices, including sunroofs that darken on-demand or with system intelligence, and sun visors that fold down like a traditional visor but include a clear, dimmable panel that can darken in on-demand or based on sunload sensors. With the dimmable visor we showed previously, the consumer would not have a vanity mirror on the visor due to the surface being all glass. So for CES this year, we had added an additional feature. With a press of a button, the see-through glass surface became a reflective surface and the lighting above visor turned on, so the person could utilize the device like a traditional vanity mirror. This new technology feature was really well received by everyone that sat in the vehicle. The last area of focus at CES was the launch of our new residential smoke detector product that we announced and displayed at the show. Gentex is celebrating our 50th anniversary this year. It's interesting to reflect on the fact that Gentex began as a smoke-detecting company. And we are now using all of our background in detecting smoke for commercial applications to create an all-new product line of residential detectors called PLACE. PLACE has four different products that are designed for specific locations in the home. There's a product for the garage, the kitchen, the child's room and a general-use product. Each of these comes with some unique technology and capability to add value to the end consumer. For example, the child's room product has a nightlight feature, a white noise generator, audio and camera that will allow parents to check up on the child remotely. We're excited to launch this new product in 2024 and expect that this new product line will open many new opportunities as we expand into the consumer-facing market. Overall, CES 2024 was an excellent opportunity for us to demonstrate to our current customers, and hopefully some future ones as well, where our product strategy and development focus is heading over the next few years. In terms of launches for the fourth quarter of 2023, there were 10 net new nameplate launches of our interior and exterior auto-dimming mirrors and electronic features. For calendar year 2023, we experienced our greatest net launch rate since 2015. And we continue to see a strong pipeline of launches through 2024. Now for an update on Full Display Mirror. The fourth quarter of 2023 was another strong quarter for Full Display Mirror shipments. And we're excited to announce that for the calendar year 2023, we were able to exceed our unit shipment goal of 500,000 units over 2022 volume by shipping approximately 750,000 units more than 2022. This would bring our 2023 FDM unit shipments to approximately 2.44 million units. It's clear in looking at this growth that the product is being well received by our OEM customers and the end consumers. 2023 was a really strong year for Gentex products and technologies. The FDM growth was outstanding. We had an extremely heavy launch schedule. And late in the year, we had minimal component shortage issues to worry about. In 2024, while we continue to push the Gentex technology path that we showed at CES, we will also need to focus on the execution of our heavy launch backlog and the redesign work needed to achieve the cost-optimized designs necessary to recover from the increases we've seen over the past few years. I'll now hand the call back over to Steve for guidance and closing remarks.\nSteven Downing: Thanks, Neil. The company's current forecast for light vehicle production for calendar year 2024 and 2025 are based on the S&P Global Mobility mid-January 2024 forecast for light vehicle production in North America, Europe, Japan, Korea and China. Light vehicle production in these markets is expected to decrease by 1% in 2024 compared to calendar year 2023. The forecasted vehicle production volumes for calendar years 2024 and 2025 from S&P Global Mobility are shown in our press release from today. Based on this light vehicle production forecast, the company is providing full year guidance estimates for calendar year 2024 as follows. Revenue for 2024 is expected to be between $2.45 billion and $2.55 billion. Gross margins for the year should be between 34% and 35%. Operating expenses are expected to be between $295 million and $305 million. The estimated annual tax rate for the year is forecasted to be between 16% and 18%. Capital expenditures for calendar year 2024 are expected to be between $225 million and $250 million. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be between $95 million and $105 million. Additionally, based on the mid-January 2024 S&P Global Mobility light vehicle production forecast as well as the company's estimates for aerospace, medical and fire protection products, the company currently expects calendar year 2025 revenue to be between $2.65 billion and $2.75 billion. Calendar year 2023 turned out to be a remarkable year for the company and was the first time that Gentex has exceeded $2 billion in annual revenue. It is important to note that the growth the company has achieved over the last few years has been driven by our new technologies and innovative product road maps. From 2018 through 2023, the company's revenue has grown by over 26% while light vehicle production in our primary markets of Europe, North America, Japan and Korea has shrunk by over 11% during the same period. We believe this revenue outperformance versus the underlying market is evidence that our product strategy is effective and is creating our targeted results. Our revenue guidance for 2024 and 2025 shows that we remain confident in our ability to outperform the underlying market and revenue growth while we continue to focus on gross margin improvement. Gentex is poised to execute on our forecasted revenue growth while maintaining focus on cost control and gross margin improvement, which are necessary to accomplish the goal of achieving a gross margin profile of 35% to 36% by the end of 2024. These factors we believe will result in record revenue and profitability that should create the foundation for increased shareholder returns over the next several years. This completes our prepared comments for today, and we can now proceed to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is going to come from the line of Luke Junk with Baird.\nLuke Junk: First, hoping we could start on the top line, especially incremental FDM units. Just wondering what's the framework that you're looking at updated this year. Is 500,000-plus units still a good number to be looking at incrementally in 2024? And then just how do you build up to that in terms of mix of new launches you're expecting this year, take rates? Anything else we should be considering?\nSteven Downing: Luke, you're absolutely right. I think we're targeting right now for 2024, about 0.5 million unit increase in FDM volume shipments for this year. In terms of the mix of where that's coming from, listen, 80% of it is going to come from existing OEMs and existing platforms but increased take rates and kind of just expansion amongst the existing OEMs. Probably that last 15% or 20% is going to be new targets, new launches. Several of those will be with new OEMs as well.\nLuke Junk: Got it. And then switching gears to margins, just curious, Steve, what initial feedback you're getting from Tier 2 suppliers as you've engaged with them going this year in January relative to, one, just their positioning around potential cracks in semi pricing and what you might need to do from a redesign standpoint this year. And if you are seeing opportunity, just how opportunistic can you be realistically pushing on the Tier 2 base?\nSteven Downing: Yes. We're actually -- we're sitting really well right now. Our purchasing team has done an excellent job of preparing 2024 pricing with the supply base. A good majority of our suppliers have reached out and have collaborated with us on how to get those costs, maybe not back to pre-pandemic levels but definitely below where they were in 2023. So that should provide some of the margin tailwind we need in '24 to help throughout the year get us to our targeted margin profile by the end of 2024. The redesigns really are going to be more of a factor at the exit velocity of '24 as we head into 2025. A lot of the work is going to take 6 to 9 months to get it -- the research, the actual designs redone and then a few months of validation. And so what we're optimistic about though is if we look at those core areas of being purchasing reductions in combination with operational efficiencies will help drive margin improvement in '24. And then the work we're doing on the engineering side will really help keep that margin stable, or if not, improve slightly in '25 and beyond.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of James Picariello with BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY).\nThomas Scholl: This is Jake on for James. Can you guys just give us some color on FDM margins and how long it's going to take them to get back to that run rate of 40% to 45%? I know they've been under pressure for the last few quarters to a year.\nSteven Downing: Yes. Well, I think they're running probably in the low 30s right now corporately in terms of what that margin profile looks like, so below corporate average, primarily driven by the cost increases that we've encountered over the last couple of years. Our goal with these redesign efforts are really to get them back in line with corporate average. So I wouldn't predict that they're going to go to 40% or anything. But somewhere in that 35%, 36% is kind of our long-term goal where we believe we can get that product over time.\nThomas Scholl: Awesome. And then exterior mirror shipments in the quarter came in very strong. Can you talk about some of the drivers there? And how should we think about that in 2024?\nSteven Downing: Yes. If you look -- yes, thanks for pointing that out. Obviously, we're very pleased with the success in outside mirror growth over the last couple of years. Fourth quarter was no exception, very, very strong growth. A lot of that is coming just from expansion and take rate improvements. Obviously, the mix, the vehicle mix has been good in terms of the types of vehicles OEMs were building during some of the constraints has definitely been a tailwind for us. Obviously, this type of volume creates some operational challenges in terms of getting capacity in place that quickly. Our team has done a remarkable job of keeping yields up, given the strong demand that's been put on the -- part of the organization. But as we look forward, a lot of our customers, including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and others, have driven very high take rates. E-vehicles, and BEV in particular, have very much latched on to some of the higher-end technologies and features. And so those have been, from a competitive set, have been driving take rates at other OEMs higher as well.\nOperator: And our next question is going to come from the line of Josh Nichols with B. Riley.\nMichael Nichols: Great to see the record results for 2023. Now I was just curious, I know historically 1Q, there's been like a 200 to 300 bps typically of like margin compression for some cost concessions. Just looking at the guide, is that like something that the company expects will happen this year and then you kind of rebound from there and get back to that 35% to 36% level in the back half of this year?\nSteven Downing: Yes, we usually see a dip in Q1. I would say Q1 of this year probably won't be quite as significant from a compression standpoint. Just if you look at our existing agreements with OEMs, it's definitely come down from where it was, given all the cost pressures that the industry has seen over the last couple of years. That 2% to 3% isn't really what we're targeting this year for -- or expecting in terms of givebacks to OEMs. We think that will be less than that. But as normal, we would expect Q1 to be probably the lightest margin quarter of the year. And then to your point, by Q4, we expect to be in that 35% to 36% range. And really, that's driven by a couple of factors as well. You have, a, the price-downs in Q1 that happened at OEMs, where also in Q1, you're still burning through inventory that was purchased based on '23 economics. And so the concessions from the supply base really won't start hitting until late Q1 or Q2.\nMichael Nichols: Great. And then it was really encouraging and good to see all the company's cutting-edge technology at CES this year, whether it was the thermal imaging or dimmable glass or in-cabin monitoring and then the new direct-to-consumer offering. There's a number of things the company is working on here in terms of advanced technologies. But I guess, if we're thinking about what could be the next or nearest-term positive catalysts in terms of monetization and revenue growth, like how would you handicap some of the newer offerings in terms of which one is going to drive more revenue over the next like 12 to 36 months?\nSteven Downing: Yes. See, in the shorter term, it's going to be driver monitoring. We're working on a couple of launches right now with some OEMs, where we have business awards. So those would be probably creating material revenue in the -- of that feature set that you saw at CES. That will be the one driving material revenue the soonest. Following after that, obviously, we still think in the next 3 to 5 years, it's going to be the large-area devices and from an overall dollar standpoint, still has one of the largest opportunities that we've seen as a company. Probably in that same horizon obviously will be the visor project. We've only been showing that really for about a year now. So we've got a lot of work to do. But the interest at CES in that product, in particular, was very tangible. I mean, it's -- there's hardly anyone that you show that product to that doesn't understand the use case and why there could be some consumer value created.\nMichael Nichols: Just as a follow-up, I know that Europe is moving towards mandating this type of stuff for in-cabin monitoring. Like any way to quantify the impacts or just some color on what you're seeing there in terms of the demand uptick?\nSteven Downing: Yes. I mean, our first -- and that's kind of what's happening. So the real regs that are driving it are in the European Union, where some type of an assist, an alert notification is required, especially as we start to move into semiautonomous vehicles. And so that's where the majority of the business development side has been taking place. But there is a lot of interest even from existing domestic customers that are interested in this type of technology, interested in how we can integrate it, conceal the technology to make it not obvious and help just with the integration being center and high-mounted in a vehicle. There's some geography advantages to our location and the tech that we bring to the table. So we continue to see the kind of that trend, both a trend in regulation but then also a trend just in OEMs wanting and needing this type of a feature set.\nOperator: And our next question is going to come from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America.\nJohn Murphy: A couple of questions. I mean, you exited last year at 34.5% on gross. You called out 100 basis points benefit for pricing actions and then something that seems a small impact, one-time cost recoveries. And I'm just curious, I mean, you're exiting close to that 35% to 36% gross margin target you're talking about by the end of this year. What are kind of the big headwinds that would kind of dampen that out? Because I mean, you're getting pretty close to it already.\nSteven Downing: Yes, see, the single biggest one obviously will be there are some pricing concessions to OEMs that are happening at the beginning of the year. So that would be number one. Number two, one of the things that would hurt is, obviously, no one knows for sure what's going to happen with LVP. Right now, in our primary markets, it's targeted to be down 1%. We think that our current book of business will more than offset that reduction. But if sales didn't come in as high as we're expecting, obviously, that would create the other biggest headwind. On the rest of the business, we feel like we've got most of the contracts in place on the supply side. So we don't view that as a huge risk factor as we head into this year. Honestly, product mix would be the next one. And so as interest rates, if they stay elevated, do -- what is the value of the vehicle that a consumer is going to purchase? And will it or will not contain our technology? And if so, how much of it, right? So our ASPs are largely driven by type and the trim level of vehicles that are purchased by consumers.\nJohn Murphy: I mean, Steve, maybe just a follow-up to that. If I were to tell you that I think you should be modeling the business as plus 2% bare minimum for that global number, a plus 5% bare minimum for the North American production number and IHS is way too conservative, how big an impact would that have on sort of what you're communicating to us, but maybe even more importantly, how you're setting up the business? I mean, could you handle something the way you're capacitized and your OpEx in staffing is set up? Because I mean, IHS is way too low. The reality is we're going to be up. But how significantly, I think, is more the question mark. I mean, the idea that we're going to be down in this year is just a little bit preposterous. So if we were to think about -- and I'm not calling you out. I mean, I know you've got to run the business. But if you were to have that toggle of global production up at least 2%, North America up at least plus 5%, are you set up to handle it? And how big of an impact would that have the way you're communicating in this outlook?\nSteven Downing: John, I love your energy. I mean, it's been so many years since I've...\nJohn Murphy: They're off, they're off this year.\nSteven Downing: Yes. I've had so many years of being hit with a board that I think I've lost optimism or something. No, I mean, if it were to happen -- and realistically, I think that's where OEMs are trying to get to as well to the numbers you just discussed, we would see at least point-for-point improvement in our guidance. In other words, if North America was up 200 basis points instead of down 100, we would expect to see 200 to 300 at least improvement in our own business there because we do have -- obviously, we do have a lot of exposure to the North American OEMs with good content.\nJohn Murphy: Okay. And then just lastly, do you see any inventory buffer in the channel? I mean, obviously, worldwide scared people quite a bit. I mean, are you seeing anything that you've built up in your inventories or maybe even forward-looking into your Tier 1 customers, Tier 1 supplier partners and then in the automakers? Or is that something you're just not seeing...\nSteven Downing: No. Well, quite the opposite. Given the growth we've experienced over the last 2 years and the lengthening of how long it's taken to get capital, if you notice our CapEx, we keep guiding higher than we're actually able to spend. And the last 2 years haven't been because we're cutting that back, it's just because the supply base on capital has pushed out so far that it's hard to get it in place. So the last 2 years, we've been actually under-capacitized for what the volumes have been. And so our actually finished goods inventory is lower than we would like it to be. And so we're working 6/7 days at times just to keep up with demand. And so we would welcome like obviously not a slowdown but a chance for stable orders so that we could get caught up and get inventories back to where they were. So fortunately, we haven't -- from a financial side, fortunately, we haven't prebuilt or preshipped anything. So we don't see any glut in inventory either at our customers or definitely not internally.\nOperator: And our next question is going to come from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.\nMark Delaney: You started -- I was hoping to follow up on the topic John was just bringing up around LVP for this year. And you started to cover a little bit around how you guys see the regions. You mentioned, I believe, that you think North America might be tracking a little bit stronger than what IHS is currently projecting based on what you're seeing from OEM schedules. Could you talk a little bit more on all the regions and globally and anything you may be seeing in OEM schedules that is either similar or different to what IHS is projecting?\nSteven Downing: Yes, I think -- and just to clarify quickly, we are really using just John's presupposition that it was going to be better. I wouldn't say that the company necessarily feels that it's understated. It is certainly -- at this point, prognosticating light vehicle production by region is something that I obviously -- we don't get paid for that forecast. So unless you want to buy it from me, I'd be happy to provide you one if you'd like me to tell you my own personal forecast. But I look at it and say it's probably a fairly flattish production environment globally. Now the mix in between the regions, obviously, if you look at Japan, Korea, it's had a tough few years. Obviously, Europe has kind of oscillated back and forth really over the last 5. North America definitely would say there's definitely some demand there. The question is OEM mix and which OEMs are going to win in the marketplace. And quite frankly, you do have some other OEMs who are expanding into North America for sales here with their manufacturing. And that's European OEMs included. And so I kind of look at the globe and say, listen, I would fully expect that the China market will probably cool some. And if that happens and the rest of it has picked up out of our primary markets being Europe, North America and Japan, Korea, that bodes really well for us, a, our revenue is better in those areas, the profitability tends to be a little better as well.\nMark Delaney: Got it. And then the second question was on OpEx. And understandably, the company is taking OpEx up this year to support all of the different growth initiatives that you have as well as the revenue growth that you're seeing in the business. Maybe help us think a little bit beyond 2024, with the investments you're putting into place this year, is that a pretty good base of investment level and OpEx beyond '24 may grow more slowly? Or would you anticipate continued increases in OpEx that may be a little bit higher than the typical underlying economic inflation to support some of the longer-term efforts?\nSteven Downing: Yes. No, I think if you look at this guidance we put in place for this year, I think somewhere in that range for the next couple of years will probably be where we're at. Like I wouldn't expect it to go above this $225 million to $250 million range in '25. If you look at that level -- and really the factor comes if '24 and '25 pan out the way we're talking about, we're going to be looking at being at capacity -- I'm sorry, Kevin, what did you say?\nKevin Nash: I think he was asking on OpEx.\nSteven Downing: Oh, OpEx, sorry. I thought you talked about CapEx still. Well, I'll finish CapEx and we'll get to OpEx. But if you look at the CapEx plan at these levels of revenue, we are going to be needing additional facilities, not just equipment. And then on the OpEx side, really this OpEx should, once we get through this year, if we hit these numbers -- and there's a lot of ifs in that statement because it's requiring us to find a lot of talent, and the talent is difficult to locate and acquire. If we do get to these levels by the end of the year, I think the OpEx growth rate should roughly track in line with sales growth rates. It's what we try to target to. And there's a little bit of a leading indicator, obviously, of OpEx sometimes expands ahead of a sales growth splurge. But one of the things that we always try to focus on over a long period of time is trying to make sure that, that OpEx growth rate is roughly in line of sales growth rate, if not slightly below it, so you get a little bit of leverage through the bottom half of the income statement.\nOperator: And our next question is going to come from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPM.\nRyan Brinkman: Can you help us a little bit more with the addressable market of the consumer retail fire safety protection and talk about your strength in the commercial fire protection market and how that might translate over into retail, what sort of the early discussions have been around like go-to-market strategy for retail and any partners that you might have brought onboard or expect to bring onboard and how big this business ultimately could be over what time frame?\nSteven Downing: Sure. So thanks for asking that question. It was a very exciting part of the CES show was showing the new PLACE product. We have our first customer already onboard and is ready for the product once we have the engineering work completed hopefully mid this year. And so that will be kind of our SOP timing for that first customer. Beyond that, our next go-to-market philosophy is really focused on how do we get engaged with direct-to-builder. One of the things we know is the DIY market is interesting. However, we believe that the maximum upside of this product will be focused on trying to get it installed at construction or remodel. We believe, a, we know it's a lot easier of an install at that point in time. And it's easier to convince a homeowner of the significant benefits without having to rewire or redo electrical work. And our product is designed to be able to upscale. So once you have a base unit, it's easy to upgrade that unit into one of the more advanced featured rooms that Neil referenced in his prepared comments. So that's kind of the current plan for go-to-market. In terms of overall size estimates, it's a little early to kind of indicate that. Our targets, when we started developing this product, is we've got about a $20 million, $25 million book of business in the commercial side of fire protection currently. We believe that, that plus the new PLACE product, our goal is in the next 7- to 10-year period to have $100 million-or-so book of business focused on residential fire protection.\nOperator: And our next question is going to come from the line of David Whiston with Morningstar.\nDavid Whiston: You called out in the press release three main drivers to get to the gross margin target by the year-end of reducing bill of materials, throughput and overtime scrap cost reductions. I'm just curious, what's the rough breakout among those three buckets for the contribution?\nKevin Nash: Probably 70% of it is bill of material reductions with an equal split with the other two items probably would be a fair assumption.\nDavid Whiston: Okay. And on both the chip shortage and just general supply chain issues unrelated to chips, just how bad or good is everything right now? Is the chip shortage mostly behind you?\nNeil Boehm: Yes, I think in general, the component shortages, you still have a component shortage pop up once in a while. But in general, the big constraints that we've seen and experienced are behind. And I think as we've kind of mentioned before, we're in the stage of redesign, kicking off redesigns to start pulling cost out of the bill of materials.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our next question comes from the line of Ron Jewsikow with Guggenheim Securities.\nRonald Jewsikow: Just a follow-up on some of the next-generation product discussions. In '24/'25, how much of kind of the revenue growth is assumed to be coming from new products? I assume that's heavily weighted towards driver monitoring.\nSteven Downing: Yes, I would say -- I mean, if you consider new products, it depends on do you mean -- do you consider FDM growth to be a new product or a legacy product?\nRonald Jewsikow: Yes, I probably shouldn't call it legacy at this point. But this is more focused, I would say, on DMS and other stuff.\nSteven Downing: Yes, if you look at that, I'd say probably about half of the growth is going to be driven -- half of the incremental growth rate will be driven by new technology.\nRonald Jewsikow: That includes FDM then though, right?\nNeil Boehm: Yes, included in it, yes.\nRonald Jewsikow: If we exclude FDM, is it closer to like 1% or just trying to...\nSteven Downing: No, I'd say about 1/4 of it would be then from things outside of FDM that are new products.\nRonald Jewsikow: Okay, that's helpful. And then on the '25 guide specifically, if we think about kind of the 8% year-over-year number that you guys are guiding towards at the midpoint, how should we think about FDM contribution, traditional electrochromics and other products? And then I guess, more importantly, what will be needed to drive revenue growth closer to the 10% year-over-year implied at the high end of the guidance?\nSteven Downing: Yes, I think what would be needed to get to the higher end would be some help on LVP and then obviously, stabilization in take rates, especially of FDM. Those would be the two big takeaways for '24, right? Those would be the things that would actually help us get to the high end of that range.\nKevin Nash: And then most of the LVP is growing in China in that 25% range, not North America or, right, Japan, Korea.\nRonald Jewsikow: Okay. No, that's helpful color. And then just sneak one more in, a bit of a follow-up on kind of the cadence for this year. But I know in a normal year, you start getting better pricing from your supply base closer to midyear. Is that still a good way to think about this year? I know we're kind of not in a normal environment right now. Or are you already seeing better pricing from your Tier 2s?\nKevin Nash: Yes, I think we've -- the pricing is fairly locked in. It's just a matter of burning through that inventory, which is on average about 2 to 3 months for us. So that's one Steve referred to it earlier as contracts are pretty much locked in, or I wouldn't say 100%, but we feel pretty good about it. Starting in the end of the first quarter into the second is when you start to see the benefit of that roll through the financials.\nOperator: And I would now like to turn the conference back over to Josh O'Berski for closing remarks.\nJosh O'Berski: Thank you, everyone, for your time and questions today. As a reminder, Gentex will be hosting an Analyst and Investor Day on the morning of March 19, 2024, in New York at the Nasdaq building in Times Square. If you're interested in attending, please reach out to me directly, and we can follow up from there.

        "article_content": " \n\n Weyerhaeuser  Co. (NYSE:WY) has announced its financial results for the full year and fourth quarter of 2023, with net sales reaching $7.7 billion for the year and $1.8 billion for the quarter. The company reported full-year earnings of $839 million, or $1.15 per diluted share, and fourth-quarter earnings of $219 million, or $0.30 per diluted share. \nAdjusted EBITDA for the year stood at $1.7 billion, with the fourth quarter contributing $321 million. Weyerhaeuser also declared a supplemental cash dividend of $0.14 per share, totaling $0.90 per share for the year. The company has made significant strides in its strategic investments, returning a substantial $4.6 billion to shareholders since 2021 and progressing towards a $1 billion goal in timberlands investments by 2025. \nThe outlook for 2024 is optimistic, with expectations of higher sales volumes and steady demand across various segments, including an anticipated increase in EBITDA for the Natural Climate Solutions business.\nWeyerhaeuser's financial results reflect a company navigating the challenges of market fluctuations while maintaining a forward-looking approach to growth and shareholder returns. The company's strategic investments in timberlands and capital projects, such as the Holden mill rebuild, underscore its commitment to efficiency and production improvements. With a clear focus on long-term value creation, Weyerhaeuser's outlook for 2024 remains positive, buoyed by expected improvements in key business segments and a robust approach to capital allocation.\nWeyerhaeuser Co. (WY) has demonstrated resilience in its financial performance, despite facing market headwinds. An analysis of real-time data and expert insights from InvestingPro provides a deeper understanding of the company's valuation and financial health.\nInvestingPro Data highlights a market capitalization of $24.13 billion, reflecting the company's significant presence in the industry. The P/E ratio stands at 28.77, suggesting a high earnings multiple that aligns with InvestingPro Tips indicating the company is trading at such a valuation. This is further substantiated by an adjusted P/E ratio for the last twelve months as of Q3 2023, recorded at 29.79. The dividend yield as of the end of 2023 is noteworthy at 5.01%, underlining Weyerhaeuser's commitment to shareholder returns, a fact echoed by the company's track record of maintaining dividend payments for 53 consecutive years.\nInvestingPro Tips also reveal that analysts have revised their earnings expectations downwards for the upcoming period and anticipate a sales decline in the current year. This information is particularly relevant as it provides context to the company's strategic focus on timberlands investments and the Natural Climate Solutions business, which could be pivotal in offsetting the anticipated sales dip.\nFor investors looking for a comprehensive analysis of Weyerhaeuser, InvestingPro offers additional tips beyond the two included here.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Andy Taylor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Taylor. You may begin.\nAndy Taylor: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss Weyerhaeuser's fourth quarter 2023 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Davie Wold, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish.\nDevin Stockfish: Thanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. Yesterday, Weyerhaeuser reported full year GAAP earnings of $839 million or $1.15 per diluted share on net sales of $7.7 billion. Excluding special items, full year 2023 earnings totaled $749 million or $1.02 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.7 billion for the year. For the fourth quarter, we reported GAAP earnings of $219 million or $0.30 per diluted share on net sales of $1.8 billion. Excluding a net after-tax benefit of $98 million for special items, we earned $121 million or $0.16 per diluted share for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $321 million. I'll start this morning by thanking our employees for their solid execution and performance in 2023. Through their collective efforts, we delivered industry-leading operating performance, continued to serve our customers and drove meaningful advancements across our multiyear targets. As we enter 2024, we're well positioned to capitalize on improving market conditions and remain focused on driving superior long-term value for our shareholders. As highlighted on Page 19 of our earnings slides, we generated $986 million of adjusted funds available for distribution in 2023. We announced yesterday that our Board of Directors declared a supplemental cash dividend of $0.14 per share. When combined with our quarterly base dividend of $0.76 per share, we're returning total dividends to shareholders of $0.90 per share. Including $125 million of shares repurchased during the year, Weyerhaeuser is returning $783 million of total cash to shareholders based on 2023 results or approximately 80% of 2023 adjusted FAD which is at the high end of our annual target payout range. As summarized on Page 20, upon payment of the supplemental dividend, we will have returned $4.6 billion in total cash to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchase since the first full year of our new cash framework in 2021. It's worth noting that although our adjusted FAD in 2023 was lower than the last couple of years due to challenging market conditions, we continue to demonstrate that our cash return framework is both sustainable and appropriate for the company's portfolio and the cash flow that we generate from our businesses across market cycles. Notably, we increased our base dividend by 5.6% in 2023 and returned additional cash through share repurchase in our supplemental dividend. The additional cash was fully funded within our framework and required no balance sheet or portfolio actions to cover our return commitment. And given the design of our framework, we retain 20% to 25% of our adjusted FAD annually, all of which can be utilized as we evaluate future capital allocation levers, including strategic growth opportunities. We continue to believe this framework is a powerful differentiator, one that enhances our ability to drive long-term shareholder value by returning meaningful and appropriate amounts of cash back to shareholders across a variety of market conditions and also delivers an attractive total dividend yield to our shareholders. Before moving on to business segment results, I'd like to comment briefly on the purchase and sale transactions that we completed in the fourth quarter which included the acquisition of high-quality timberlands in the Carolinas and Mississippi and the divestiture of less strategic acreage in upstate South Carolina. These transactions represent a unique opportunity to further optimize our Southern Timberlands portfolio with high-quality, highly productive acreage that is well integrated with our existing operations. And these transactions were structured in a tax-efficient like-kind exchange, resulting in a net cash inflow of $7 million. The gain was recorded on the sale transaction and reported as a special item in the fourth quarter. As highlighted on Page 22, we're progressing nicely against our target to grow our timberlands portfolio through $1 billion of disciplined investments between 2022 and 2025. To date, we've deployed approximately $530 million towards our goal, including announced acquisitions in Washington, the Carolinas and Mississippi. With that, I'll now turn to fourth quarter business results, starting with Timberlands on Pages 7 through 10 of our earnings slides. Excluding special items, Timberlands contributed $77 million to fourth quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $143 million and results across all Timberlands regions were comparable to the third quarter. Turning to the Western domestic market, log demand and pricing faced downward pressure at the outset of the fourth quarter as mills adjusted to a softening lumber market and worked through elevated log inventories. As the quarter progressed, lumber takeaway improved slightly and log supply decreased seasonally. Despite lower log prices during the quarter, our average domestic sales realizations were slightly higher compared to the third quarter, largely driven by an increased mix of grade logs. Our domestic sales volumes were lower in the fourth quarter as we shifted volume to China to capture higher-margin opportunities. Per unit log and haul costs were moderately higher and forestry and road costs were seasonally lower. Our fee harvest volumes were slightly lower compared to the third quarter. Moving to the Western export business. In Japan, despite ongoing consumption headwinds, inventories of European lumber imports have largely normalized and the Japanese log market returned to a more balanced state in the fourth quarter. As a result, our average sales realizations for export volumes to Japan were comparable to the third quarter. Our Japanese sales volumes were slightly lower in the fourth quarter and continued to be impacted by reduced shipments to a customer that sustained fire damage at one of its sawmills in the third quarter of last year. That said, this customer has implemented plans to recover most of the lost production and we continue to shift volume to other customers in Japan. As a result, we expect to increase our export volumes into the Japanese market in the first quarter. In China, log supply into the region has adjusted to lower consumption levels and the market was largely balanced in the fourth quarter. As a result, our average sales realizations for export volumes to China were comparable to the third quarter. Given steady demand from our Chinese customers, coupled with moderating market conditions in Western domestic market, we significantly increased our sales volumes into China in the fourth quarter. Turning to the South. Southern sawlog and fiber markets softened slightly in the fourth quarter, largely in response to ample log supply, elevated mill inventories and reduced demand for finished goods. Despite these market dynamics, demand for our logs remained steady, given our delivered programs across the region. As a result, our average sales realizations and fee harvest volumes were comparable to the third quarter. Per unit log and haul costs were also comparable and forestry and road costs were seasonally lower. Turning now to Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources on Pages 11 and 12. For the full year, Real Estate and ENR generated $320 million of adjusted EBITDA, slightly higher than our revised full year guidance. In the fourth quarter, the segment contributed $50 million to earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $67 million, a $27 million decrease compared to the third quarter, largely driven by the timing and mix of properties sold. Average price per acre increased from the prior quarter and remains elevated compared to historical levels as we continue to see stable interest from buyers for HBU properties, resulting in high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber value. I'll now make a few comments on our Natural Climate Solutions business. As shown on Page 23, our full year adjusted EBITDA was $47 million. This represents a 9% increase compared to 2022 and a 114% increase since the inception of this business in 2020. For 2023, we achieved solid contributions from conservation, mitigation banking and renewables and demand for these businesses continues to grow. In addition, we achieved notable milestones in our forest carbon business in 2023, including the approval of our pilot project in Maine and the monetization of the initial credits from this project. These credits were sold in the fourth quarter at a strong price and demonstrate our commitment to offering only the highest quality credits to the market. Looking forward, we expect the new issuance of credits from our Maine project later this year. Further, we're developing additional forest carbon projects within our U.S. timberlands. We anticipate receiving approval on 2 projects in the U.S. South in early '24 and intend to monetize additional credits in the voluntary market this year. Turning to our carbon capture and sequestration business. We continue to see solid progress being made on the projects we've announced with Oxy Low Carbon Ventures and Exxon (NYSE:XOM) and both are expected to be online in late 2025 or 2026. Moving forward, we continue to advance discussions with high-quality CCS developers on portions of our Southern U.S. acreage and expect to announce additional agreements in the future. As we look back over the last several years, I'm extremely proud of the progress that we've made in our Natural Climate Solutions business and the leadership we've demonstrated along the way. We were the first company in our space to embark on this journey in a comprehensive manner and had delivered notable accomplishments across all of our NCS businesses. And in the process, we built a world-class team with deep technical expertise and a strong commercial focus. We've laid the foundation to develop and advance our NCS offerings in-house, allowing Weyerhaeuser to capture the vast majority of the economics associated with these opportunities. And we've quickly established a peer-leading position in emerging carbon markets. As we think about the future, we remain focused on growing our NCS business to $100 million of EBITDA by year-end 2025 and we see significant future upside as markets continue to develop, particularly in carbon and renewables. And with the work we've already completed and the prospects of advancing NCS across our expansive timberland holdings, we have a lot of conviction that there is no company in this space with the capabilities or asset base to deliver on this value creation opportunity at scale like Weyerhaeuser. So now moving on to Wood Products on Pages 13 through 15. Wood Products contributed $105 million to earnings before special items in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $159 million, a 52% reduction from the third quarter, largely driven by lower commodity pricing. Starting with lumber. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was a $34 million loss. Weaker product pricing was the primary driver as the framing lumber composite posted its lowest quarterly average in a number of years. Our average sales realizations decreased 14% compared to the third quarter. This was driven by cautious buyer sentiment and ample lumber supply in the North American market. That said, buyer sentiment and product pricing started to improve toward the end of the year, following stronger-than-expected housing starts data and positive signals from the Fed on the trajectory of interest rates. Our fourth quarter performance was further impacted by a decrease in production levels which resulted in lower sales volumes and higher unit manufacturing costs. This was largely driven by a combination of taking additional holiday downtime at our Pacific Northwest mills, a period of downtime at our mill in British Columbia and operating challenges at certain facilities. Market conditions were particularly challenging in the Northwest in the fourth quarter, given the more rapid decline in lumber pricing compared to log prices. As we enter 2024, market conditions are starting to improve and we expect stronger performance from our lumber business in the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for OSB was $73 million, a decrease of $45 million compared to the third quarter, primarily due to lower product pricing. Benchmark pricing for OSB began the quarter on a downward trajectory but stabilized by the end of October and increased through year-end. This improvement was largely driven by lean inventories, supply limitations and a resilient demand from new home construction activity. As a result, our OSB pricing exited the quarter at a higher level than where we entered. However, our fourth quarter average realizations decreased by 17% compared to the prior quarter. Our sales volumes and fiber costs were comparable to the third quarter and unit manufacturing costs were moderately lower. Engineered Wood Products delivered $104 million of adjusted EBITDA, a decrease of $21 million compared to the third quarter. Sales realizations for most products decreased slightly as supply and demand continue to rebalance in certain markets. I would note, however, that pricing remains quite healthy on a historical basis. Sales volumes were lower for most products compared to the third quarter, driven by seasonally lower demand and improving supply across the EWP market. Unit manufacturing costs were slightly lower in the fourth quarter and raw material costs increased primarily for OSB web stock. In Distribution, adjusted EBITDA decreased $15 million compared to the third quarter, largely driven by a decrease in commodity realizations and seasonally lower sales volumes. With that, I'll turn the call over to Davie to discuss some financial items and our first quarter and 2024 outlook.\nDavid Wold: Thank you, Devin and good morning, everyone. I'll be covering key financial items and fourth quarter financial performance before moving into our first quarter and full year 2024 outlook. I'll begin with key financial items which are summarized on Page 17. We generated $288 million of cash from operations in the fourth quarter, bringing our total for the year to more than $1.4 billion. As Devin mentioned, we are returning $783 million to shareholders based on 2023 results which includes $125 million of share repurchases. Fourth quarter share repurchase activity totaled $15 million and we have now completed approximately $750 million of activity under our $1 billion share repurchase authorization. Entering 2024, we will continue to leverage our flexible cash return framework and look to repurchase shares opportunistically when we believe it will create shareholder value. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the year with approximately $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents, of which $102 million is earmarked for the supplemental dividend we announced yesterday that will be paid in February. In December, we repaid our $860 million, 5.2% private note at maturity and also closed on a 5-year $250 million variable rate term loan. This completes a series of transactions over the course of the year, along with our $750 million bond issuance in May to refinance approximately $1 billion of debt. We ended the year with gross debt of $5.1 billion, consistent with our total as of the prior year-end and we have no further debt maturities until 2025. Fourth quarter results for our unallocated items are summarized on Page 16. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment increased by $8 million compared to the third quarter. This increase was primarily attributable to changes in intersegment profit elimination and LIFO. Key outlook items for the first quarter and full year 2024 are presented on Pages 24 and 25. In our Timberlands business, we expect first quarter earnings before special items and adjusted EBITDA to be comparable to the fourth quarter of 2023. Turning to our Western Timberlands operations, we expect steady log demand in the domestic market in the first quarter as mills respond to seasonally lower log supply and the prospect of improving lumber takeaway ahead of the spring building season. Given this dynamic, we expect higher domestic sales volumes compared to the fourth quarter. That said, we anticipate a slight decrease in our overall and our average domestic sales realizations largely driven by a lower mix of grade logs. Absent weather-related disruptions, we expect our fee harvest volumes to be moderately higher in the first quarter. Per unit log and haul costs are expected to be significantly lower as we make the seasonal transition to lower elevation and lower-cost harvest operations. And forestry and road costs are expected to be moderately lower due to the seasonal nature of these activities. Moving to the export markets, starting with Japan. As Devin mentioned, we expect to deliver higher sales volumes into the Japanese market in the first quarter. This is largely in response to measures taken by one of our customers to increase production following a fire at their sawmill in the third quarter of last year. With a more balanced Japanese log market and improving conditions in the Western domestic market, we anticipate slightly higher average sales realizations for our export logs into Japan in the first quarter. In China, log demand is expected to moderate in the first quarter in response to reduced consumption during the Lunar New Year holiday. Given this dynamic, coupled with improving Western domestic market conditions, we expect to significantly decrease our sales volumes into China during the quarter. Our average sales realizations are expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter. Turning to the South. Despite ample log inventories, Southern log markets are expected to be fairly stable in the first quarter as mills respond to a seasonal reduction in log supply and the prospect of increased demand for finished goods. As a result, we expect our average sales realizations to be comparable to the fourth quarter. Our fee harvest volumes and forestry and road costs are expected to be moderately lower due to wet weather conditions that are typical in the first quarter and we anticipate comparable per unit log and haul costs. In the North, our fee harvest volumes are expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter and we anticipate moderately higher sales realizations due to mix. Turning to our full year harvest plan. For 2024, we expect total company fee harvest volumes to increase to approximately 35.5 million tons, with all regions delivering slightly higher volumes compared to 2023 levels. Moving to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. We anticipate steady demand for our real estate properties in 2024 and continue to expect a consistent flow of transactions with significant premiums to timber value. In our Natural Climate Solutions business, we anticipate a significant increase in EBITDA in 2024 as we continue to advance toward our $100 million target. For the segment, we expect full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $320 million. Basis as a percentage of real estate sales is expected to be approximately 35% to 45% for the year. First quarter earnings are expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter of 2023, while adjusted EBITDA is expected to be approximately $15 million higher primarily due to the timing and mix of real estate sales. Turning to our Wood Products segment. Benchmark prices for lumber and OSB have increased from lower levels in the fourth quarter but have remained fairly stable over the last several weeks. As the quarter progresses, we expect improving market conditions and demand for both products heading into the spring building season. Excluding the effects of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and OSB, we expect first quarter adjusted EBITDA and earnings before special items to be slightly higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. For our lumber business, we expect higher production and sales volumes in the first quarter and moderately lower unit manufacturing costs as operating conditions improve. Log costs are expected to be slightly lower, primarily in Canada. For our oriented strand board business, we anticipate sales volumes to be moderately higher compared to the fourth quarter with slightly lower unit manufacturing costs. Fiber costs are expected to be slightly higher in the first quarter. As shown on Page 26, our current and quarter-to-date average sales realizations for lumber and OSB are slightly higher than the fourth quarter averages. Turning to our Engineered Wood Products business. We expect improving demand heading into the spring building season. As a result, we anticipate moderately higher sales volumes in the first quarter, primarily for solid section products. Our average sales realizations are expected to be slightly lower for most products as previously determined price adjustments take effect in certain markets. Raw material costs are expected to be slightly lower compared to the fourth quarter. For our distribution business, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be higher compared to the fourth quarter, primarily driven by an increase in commodity realizations and higher sales volumes. I'll wrap up with some additional full year outlook items highlighted on Page 25. Our full year 2023 interest expense was $280 million. For full year 2024, we expect interest expense will be approximately $275 million. Turning to taxes, our full year 2023 effective tax rate was approximately 12%, excluding special items. For first quarter and full year 2024, we expect our effective tax rate will be between 13% and 16% before special items based on the forecasted mix of earnings between our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary. For cash taxes, we paid $63 million for full year 2023 which was lower than our tax expense, excluding special items due to the timing of U.S. and Canadian tax payments. We expect our 2024 cash taxes will be comparable to our overall tax expense. For pension and post-employment plans, our noncash, non-operating pension and post-employment expense was $45 million in 2023. For 2024, we expect this expense will be comparable to 2023. Cash paid for pension and post-employment plans in 2023 was $20 million. In 2024, we do not anticipate any cash contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plan and our required cash payments for all other plans will be approximately $20 million. Turning now to capital expenditures. Our full year 2023 capital investments totaled $440 million plus $7 million of capitalized interest. We expect total capital for 2024 will be comparable at approximately $440 million which includes: $115 million for Timberlands, inclusive of reforestation costs; $310 million for Wood Products; and $15 million for planned corporate IT system investments. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions.\nDevin Stockfish: Thanks, Davie. Before wrapping up this morning, I'll make a few comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets and touch briefly on our multiyear targets. Starting with housing. Despite elevated mortgage interest rates for most of the year, the housing market remained resilient in 2023, particularly in the single-family segment. This was supported by a limited inventory of existing homes on the market, combined with the homebuilder's ability to offer mortgage rate buydowns and other incentives and underpinned by a strong overall demand for housing. Given the tailwinds from last year, along with improving mortgage rates and a more favorable macro environment, our outlook for single-family housing demand in 2024 is more optimistic relative to this time last year. And that aligns with what we are hearing from our homebuilder customers. We are, however, somewhat less optimistic about the multifamily segment in the near term, largely driven by the recent and upcoming influx of multifamily units entering the market. As a reminder, single-family construction is a much more important demand driver for our business than multifamily. All in all, we're more positive on the housing setup for 2024 and believe we should see an uptick in demand for our products. And our longer-term view on housing fundamentals continues to be very favorable, supported by strong demographic trends and a vastly underbuilt housing stock. Turning to repair and remodel. Activity in the fourth quarter remained steady and barring significant weather disruptions, we expect a similar level of repair and remodel demand in the first quarter. As for 2024, we believe the underlying demand fundamentals are incrementally more positive compared to last year, supported by otherwise prospective homebuyers choosing to remodel in lieu of purchasing a new home and a higher mortgage rate environment, combined with a healthier economy. And based on recent trends, we think activity will be more heavily weighted toward the Pro segment versus DIY. Looking beyond 2024, most of the key drivers supporting healthy repair and remodel demand remain intact, including favorable home equity levels and an aging housing stock. Finally, I'd like to provide an update on the progress we've made against the multiyear targets we announced during our Investor Day in September of 2021. As highlighted on Slide 21, we've made notable advancements on all fronts. Starting with our portfolio, we've more than -- we're more than halfway to our $1 billion Timberlands growth target and we've increased Natural Climate Solutions EBITDA by 114% since the inception of that business. In terms of our operating performance, we've made progress against all of our OpEx priorities and have captured $77 million of margin improvements over the last 2 years. Additionally, through the third quarter of 2023, we delivered peer-leading EBITDA margins across all of our Wood Products businesses and are number one in EBITDA per acre in Western Timberlands. On the ESG front, we're making progress on reducing our greenhouse gas emissions and have committed to net zero emissions by 2040. And finally, we continue to demonstrate our ongoing commitment to disciplined capital allocation by increasing our quarterly dividend by more than 5% annually and returning nearly $4.6 billion of cash to shareholders based on our results from 2021 through 2023. We're incredibly proud of these accomplishments, all of which have made Weyerhaeuser a stronger and more valuable company. Looking forward, we remain committed to driving continued improvements across each of these areas and are well positioned to achieve our strategic targets by year-end 2025. So in closing, our performance in 2023 reflects solid execution across our businesses. As we enter 2024, we're encouraged by resiliency in the housing market and maintain a favorable long-term outlook for the demand fundamentals that will drive growth for our businesses. Our balance sheet is exceptionally strong and we remain focused on serving our customers and driving long-term value for shareholders through our unrivaled portfolio, industry-leading performance, strong ESG foundation and disciplined capital allocation. So with that, I think we can open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs.\nSusan Maklari: Just start with the outline that you gave, framing the housing outlook for this year was helpful. And when you think about Weyerhaeuser's positioning relative to that, can you talk about the ability to ramp your production across the different product categories? Where do you think you're sort of best able to really capture the benefits of that lift, especially perhaps if some of the R&R activity comes back this year? And then any thoughts on the channel inventories across the different products and how they're positioned going into the spring?\nDevin Stockfish: Sure. Well, I'll start with the first question and sort of go product by product. On the lumber side, that's the business where we have the most flexibility to increase production. And I would say just as a baseline, we would expect to see a pretty significant increase in our production levels in 2024 as we've made a lot of capital investments over the last several years that are really starting to come to fruition. But we do have some upside there. Lumber is one of those areas where you can add shifts, you can add some overtime to take advantage of strong markets when those present themselves. OSB, it's a little bit more difficult. Those operations typically run 24/7 already, so there's really not a whole lot of flex on the OSB side. I would say on the EWP side, there's a little bit of flexibility but those typically have an operating posture where you just don't have as much slack in the system. So really, for the most part, it's going to be lumber and, to a large extent, distribution as well is another area where you can take advantage of strong markets. On the inventory and the channel question, I would say lumber inventory right now is still pretty lean across the system. OSB, I would say, is more or less normal for this time of year. Before the weather events, I would say that the South maybe on the OSB side was a little leaner than normal but otherwise mostly balanced across the system. And then on EWP, I'd say it's about normal for this time of year.\nSusan Maklari: Okay, that's helpful. And then you mentioned the $77 million of OpEx that you have realized in the last 2 years. As you think about 2024, any thoughts on some of the initiatives you'll be focused on, perhaps areas that you are planning to do certain initiatives in? Can you just give us some color on that?\nDevin Stockfish: Sure. Well, just a quick note on that $77 million. Given the inflationary backdrop that we've been operating in over the last several years, that's really a remarkable number. And as we think about rolling into 2024, a lot of the initiatives are the same ones we've been working on. It's reliability in the Wood Products business, taking advantage of all of those capital projects and just the operating improvements. It's looking for opportunities to improve recovery, to make sure that you're capturing the full value of the raw materials entering the mill set. We're continuing to work on innovation across the system all throughout Wood Products and I think that's going to start really delivering some value. On the Timberlands side, it's continuing to look for ways to reduce our log and haul costs, improve how we build roads, really just across the whole system, looking for opportunities to take cost out of the system and improve efficiency and reliability. So it's a lot of the same things that we've been working on for a long time. I think the good news is that OpEx is deeply ingrained in the culture. We have a lot of buy-in all up and down the organization and we're going to stay really focused. And assuming that we're going to be in an environment this year with inflation where it's back to a more normalized level, I think we'll see an uptick in the OpEx that we deliver this year relative to the last couple.\nSusan Maklari: That's great. And good luck with everything.\nOperator: Our next question is from George Staphos, Bank of America.\nGeorge Staphos: Congratulations on the year overall. My two questions, I wanted to maybe piggyback, it's a good segue from Susan's question. So certainly, there's been a lot of progress in Wood Products and in lumber in particular, over the years through black at the bottom. Yet it was interesting that, in fact, lumber did have a bit of a loss here in the fourth quarter. Obviously, at pricing headwinds, you had some seasonality, yet there are some other issues as well in terms of maybe some additional downtime relative to normal. But tell us how you think about maybe the need to go back to black at the bottom and see if there's a need for more significant work, given what you said to Susan's question about the fact there's been more inflation. How should we think about that, Devin?\nDevin Stockfish: Sure. Good question. George, candidly, Q4 was a very challenging quarter in the lumber markets. The product pricing, really the key driver when you see prices going back to the lowest levels in several years, combined with log prices really not going down nearly as much, that just creates a very challenging operating environment. I think as we look at black at the bottom, we think about that not just on a quarterly basis but really over a year-long period. And even in what was a more challenging environment last year, we're obviously still profitable in lumber. That all being said, we're never satisfied. And I do think one of the things you'll see in 2024 is we're going to really ramp up the OpEx in really not just in lumber, across Wood Products as we're facing less headwinds from labor inflation, supplies and equipment inflation. Ordinarily, we can more than offset that through our OpEx work. This last year was just a little bit more challenging. So I expect to see more traction on that front. And then the other thing is we've been doing a lot of work around CapEx over the last several years. And I think in '24, you're going to see some of that result. Holden will be up and fully running this year. We've had a number of other capital projects underway that I think you're going to see the benefits of this year. So we feel pretty good about where we are, notwithstanding a difficult Q4. As we look across the industry and the cost curve, I still think we're in pretty good shape there. You've been around lumber for a long time, George. From time to time, you see these moments in time where the pricing dips below what's probably reasonable. It will eventually recover and we think we're on that path here even just as we head into Q1. But we're never satisfied. We're going to keep pushing. We want to be industry-leading from a cost standpoint, from a production standpoint, from an efficiency standpoint and we're not going to stop until we're there.\nGeorge Staphos: Appreciate the thoughts on that, Devin and certainly, we'll look to mark the progress. My other question, again, is on the lumber side but in this case, EWP and Engineered Product. So can you talk about why you're seeing, I guess, realization is flat to down? I don't want to paraphrase poorly but that was my take on your commentary, looking out into 1Q. I realize it's a regional market, you get sometimes some imbalances but what's your view on the year relative to supply-demand, your operating stance and how that will translate overall into commercial realizations?\nDevin Stockfish: Sure, George. On the realization side, as we look at the EWP market, unlike OSB and lumber which price minute to minute, EWP pricing actions typically have a lag. And so as much as anything, Q1, the commentary on realizations is just over the course of 2023, as that market was rebalancing, there were a variety of different price actions in different geographies. And so Q1 is really when those are hitting in full. The EWP market as a whole, I think, is still pretty solid. Pricing overall, if you look back on a historical basis, is still very strong. As we look into '24, we're getting some pretty strong optimistic signals from our builder customers. And so we're expecting steady demand. Pricing is always just a reflection in each individual market of what the supply-demand dynamic looks like. But in a stronger housing environment with what we expect to be mortgage rates continuing to come down, we think the setup for EWP is good. And to the extent that, that market really develops and picks up, we'll be in good shape from an EWP standpoint.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi.\nAnthony Pettinari: Looking at the market for Timberlands, when you look back at 2023, can you talk about maybe what kind of price appreciation trends you saw in the market maybe on average for good quality Southern Timberlands and the volume of transactions that you saw? And then as we start out the year here, any kind of further comments on just how you see the market in terms of availability of timberlands, who you're competing with for some of these transactions? Or has there been any sort of change there?\nDevin Stockfish: Sure. Well, when we look back at 2023, I think the year as a whole is pretty typical in terms of transaction volume, somewhere in that $2.5 billion mark. Last year was a little bit more heavily weighted to the back half of the year. We saw more activity as we got towards the end of 2023. In terms of the overall appreciation, you can look back just really over the last several years. It wasn't that long ago were $2,000 an acre for good timberlands in the South was pretty typical. Those values have increased pretty substantially. We've seen examples of really high-quality timberlands in the South going as much as $4,000 an acre and it's not atypical to see above-average properties going in the high-two\u2019s [ph]. So we've seen a pretty strong value appreciation in U.S. Southern Timberlands prices. Same thing for the West, I would say, just as an example. As we think about 2024, still very early in the year. There aren't a whole lot of transactions in the market right now. That's not unusual in January. But as we think about the year as a whole, we're expecting a pretty typical year, anywhere between $2 billion and $3 billion of transaction value for the year. I would expect those deals to continue to be very competitive. Still seems to be a lot of interest in this asset class. And in terms of who we're going to be competing for deals, it's going to, I'm sure, be the same cast of characters. The TMOs will be active, the timber REITs, I assume, will be into some of those deals, maybe not quite as much, given some of the announcements from some of our competitors but I suspect they'll still be having their toe in the water to some extent. But then I think you're also going to continue to see some of these new entrants, some of the alternative entities that are looking for carbon values or others that haven't historically been active. So we're expecting it to continue to be competitive. We'll be very active as we have been over a number of years. We'll continue to look for opportunities to improve the value of our asset but at the same time being disciplined to make sure that we pay the right price for those assets.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay, that's helpful. And then just shifting gears to Wood Products. In the Pacific Northwest, I think recently, you had a competitor that closed a sawmill in Oregon. And they expressed concerns around potentially restricted policies on harvests on state forest. And I'm just curious, I mean, does that have any impact on the market or your business maybe not directly but just in terms of availability of contractors, competitive dynamics? I'm just curious if there's any read-through there.\nDevin Stockfish: Sure. Well, the reference there from that mill closure was with respect to some new regulations in Oregon that came into full implementation on January 1 of this year. And the reality is Oregon was already a very tensioned wood basket and with these new regulations which I'll say just by the way, these regulations are really just bringing Oregon closer to the regulations in Washington. So it's -- we've done business in Washington for a long time under those regulations and we'll be just fine under these new regulations. But the reality is it's going to make Oregon somewhat more tensioned than it already was. And so fiber supply will be challenged for certain participants depending on the geography. For Weyerhaeuser, we're in a beneficial position in that we have our own fee timberlands. And so I don't anticipate any issues with fiber availability for our mills. But it may ultimately push the price of logs up in that market as there's less timber supply across the stable manufacturing base.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kurt Yinger with D.A. Davidson.\nKurt Yinger: I just had 1 question. Can you maybe talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in terms of European lumber imports over the second half of the year? And in addition to that, we've heard at least that there's been a growing amount of imported LVL showing up as well. How are you thinking about that potentially impacting the EWP market in '24 and longer term, I guess, the potential that European competitors could try to, I guess, become bigger participants in the domestic market here?\nDevin Stockfish: Well, with respect to your first question on European lumber, we certainly saw that come down over the back half of 2023. I think that's a reflection of primarily lumber prices and just the all-in cost to get lumber from Europe to the U.S. relative to the pricing dynamic. It just didn't make a lot of sense. So that certainly came down over the course of '23. On a go-forward basis, as we think about lumber, European lumber coming into the market, a couple of things I would point out. First of all, one of the things that was making that trip a little easier is with all of the salvage activity in Central Europe from the beetle infestation, they were getting very, very cheap logs. That salvage activity is starting to wind down. And certainly, we've seen that in terms of the fewer logs going into China from Europe from salvage and we've heard anecdotally a lot of the salvageable -- economically salvageable wood is working through. So there won't be as much cheap fiber to compete in this market. And then over the longer term, given that beetle infestation, the loss of Russian lumber into that market, at some point, the European economy will improve and the domestic demand for European lumber will improve. And I think you'll see more of that number staying in that market over the long term. With respect to your question about LVL, I think that anecdotally, I think that's true around the margins. You are seeing more of that coming into the U.S. I still think it's more or less a rounding error at this point. For us, in the market that we participate in on the EWP space, it comes with a heavy service component and there's a customer service aspect that we're able to provide to our customers that one of the reasons is why Joist is such a respected brand. It's not just the quality but the service component. And I think that will be hard for people that are importing a small amount of LVL to compete with. So it's something we'll watch but I'm not overly concerned about it at this point.\nOperator: Our next question is from Matthew McKellar with RBC Capital Markets.\nMatthew McKellar: First would be now that you're through monetizing your initial forest carbon credits for the pilot project in Maine, could you maybe share any key lessons learned through undertaking that first project? And talk to how you intend to apply those to the projects you're developing in the U.S. South and elsewhere over the next couple of years.\nDevin Stockfish: Sure. Well, we certainly learned some things going through that project. That's why we called it a pilot project. I think the key things from my standpoint are number one and we certainly saw this, I think, in the price that we were able to get with these initial carbon credits, quality matters. And so we put in the time upfront to build out the internal team and expertise to do these things right. And I think that will certainly serve us well. These are complicated. And so again, that expertise to be able to navigate the -- both the development but also the interactions with the third-party auditors and the ACR, that process, having people that really know what they're doing serves you well and makes it more efficient. And I think we've learned a number of things that will make that process go much more quickly going forward. I do think there's still an opportunity to build out some of the infrastructure, particularly around third-party auditors for the amount of carbon credits that we expect to be coming to market in the years to come. We're going to need more infrastructure to ensure that, that can be done efficiently. But the good news is, as we get through this project, if you bring quality projects to the market, we think there's a lot of demand. And so we're really pleased with where we are. We're building out the pipeline. Two projects we expect to get approved in the first half. We've got 2 or 3 more in the pipeline. We expect to be monetizing additional credits this year and those just continue to build. Each project you get layers on top of the prior ones and you build out a nice revenue stream over time. So I think we're really well positioned and in good shape heading into 2024.\nMatthew McKellar: Great. And maybe next, has there been any change at all in your confidence level or appetite around the target of acquiring that $1 billion in timberlands by 2025? It looks like you included your transaction, the Carolinas and Mississippi with FIA towards that target but that did come with a net cash inflow. So just wondering if there's any change in your thinking even at the margin around being a net acquirer of timberlands with the view that prices should rise over time.\nDevin Stockfish: No. We still have a high degree of conviction about the value of timberlands over time and our ability to generate strong returns off of that asset. So just a reminder, that $1 billion was really just a reflection of year-over-year through our programmatic M&A activities, we think we will, on average, bring in about $250 million of acquisitions. So there's no magic to that $1 billion. We're going to continue to buy timberlands today, tomorrow, years from now. That's just our core business. We're also always going to be optimizing. And so from time to time, you'll see us trim the portfolio here and there. I think this FIA transaction was a great example of that. We picked up some really strong mature timber that's going to generate nice cash flow close to our other operations, close to our mills, opportunities to create synergies there and divested some land which was fine land. It was just -- it was a little bit more scattered in upstate South Carolina, wasn't near other operations, so just weren't able to provide some of the synergies that we can provide in other places. So those kinds of transactions will happen from time to time. It's pretty unique to be able to do those buy-sell transactions concurrently. When you find those opportunities, we're certainly happy to entertain those. But on balance, we still expect to be a net acquirer over time because we think the value of timberlands is going up and we think we do a good job running them and continue to generate returns.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Roxland with Truist Securities.\nMichael Roxland: Congrats on the year. Just 1 quick question on EWP. I just want to get some color on order files and how extended they may be into 1Q, particularly as you mentioned, Devin, that those filters are actively seeking products ahead of the spring construction season. So where do order files stand at present? And can you comment on where your EWP operating rate was in 4Q? I think you called out a high 70s range in 3Q.\nDevin Stockfish: Yes. So you're a little fuzzy there. I think you're asking about order files. Across the different product lines, order files are pretty much in the normal range across lumber and OSB for this time of year. EWP, we have brought those down to a more normalized level last year. I think as we started off 2023, we were expecting a softer single-family housing market and so we had dialed back production. It took us a good part of the year to get caught back up. Our order file has extended out quite a bit from much of 2023. But heading into '24, I think we're in a better position which will be, I think, appreciated by our customers. As we look at operating rates in Q4 for EWP, we were in the low 80s in terms of operating rates for EWP and we'll be up somewhat as we look to Q1 2024.\nMichael Roxland: Appreciate that. And this even for the order files, I mean, how far do they extend in 1Q thus far? Is it February, March? I mean, how many weeks out do they extend, particularly given -- can you comment around the strong interest from the builders?\nDevin Stockfish: Yes. I mean, it's product dependent but it can range anywhere from 3 weeks to 5 weeks is pretty much in that normal range and that's kind of where we're sitting right now.\nMichael Roxland: Perfect. And then just one quick question on Timberland, especially on pulpwood. I want to get your thoughts around mill closures, line closures that happened in terms of number of containerboard mills have closed, the number of pulp lines have been taken offline permanently. You have Enviva (NYSE:EVA) going through a restructuring. So would love to get your thoughts on pulpwood demand, obviously plus valuable inflection but nevertheless, it helps with shorter retention, helps with near-term cash flow. So how do you think about rotations, harvest planning and the like, given the changing end market dynamics?\nDevin Stockfish: Yes, that's a great question. We've seen over the last several years, generally speaking, the pulpwood market has been somewhat in decline. We've seen a lot of mill closures over the years, as you say. Just even recently, we've had a handful of either full mill closures or line closures and that's created some challenge, broadly speaking, in the pulpwood market. I would say for us, because of our scale, we generally have pretty strong relationships with the big consumers of pulpwood. That's true across the pulp and paper manufacturers. That's true across the pellet manufacturers. And so as a general matter, we're typically able to move our volume. But obviously, the pricing dynamic is impacted with less demand overall, so it's something that we're certainly watching. As we think about silviculture, one of the fundamental tenets of how we think about that over the long term is to make sure that we have optionality out into the future. And so as we think about how many trees per acre, our thinning regimes, all of those things, they contemplate a future where we either need more or less grade fiber, et cetera. So we try to preserve as much flexibility out into the future as we can. All of that being said, I would note on the pulpwood market, we're continuing to look -- we, Weyerhaeuser, are continuing to look for opportunities to move that volume. We're having conversations with parties in Asia about potential, either pellet or pulpwood type opportunities, for export. I think there may, in the not-too-distant future, be opportunities for biofuels, sustainable aviation fuels that could tension up some of those markets as well. And so our business development team is very focused on that. And we'll make sure that we, Weyerhaeuser, are able to move our pulpwood volume over time.\nMichael Roxland: And good luck in the year.\nOperator: Our final question is from Ketan Mamtora with BMO Capital Markets.\nKetan Mamtora: Devin or Davie, can you talk a little bit about maybe just a couple of key projects that you have in Wood Products from a CapEx standpoint?\nDevin Stockfish: Yes. I mean, so I'll start with Holden. That's our latest mill rebuild brownfield project. That's coming along nicely. We started up the planer mill in Q4. We're ramping up production. We feel very good about that project. The beauty about Holden is it's going to be a phenomenal world-class mill that's completely surrounded by our fee timberlands. So a lot of synergies there and we're excited to see that fully ramp up this year. Beyond that, our program is really just, it's projects that we've already done in other places. So it's nothing super sexy. It's adding CDKs, it's adding new merchandisers, trim store stackers, gang saws. Really, the way that program is developed is every mill has a 5-year road map on how to get from where we are today to world-class. And each individual mill may have different things that are bottlenecks that they need to fix and solve to get to that point. So it's nothing really remarkable. It's just continuing to do what we have been doing, executing well and making sure we do those projects on time, on budget and that's really the essence of our capital plan and has been, for the most part, for a number of years.\nKetan Mamtora: Understood. That's helpful. And then just 1 more question around capital allocation, Devin. As you sort of look to 2024 and beyond, I mean, it's been for a couple of years that you are on this sort of the new approach to capital allocation. Any sort of update around how you guys are thinking about supplemental dividend versus share repurchases? And sort of as you look at the different options, sort of how do you think about one over the other?\nDavid Wold: Sure. You bet, Ketan. I think we really have looked at that consistently over the last few years and I really don't see that changing substantially as we move forward. I would just say we're in a very fortunate position. We have a lot of levers, so that includes M&A, investing in the business, paying down debt, base, variable dividend payments, among others. We're constantly evaluating those views on capital allocation but those factors are dynamic. So it's something we always need to be watching. To your point, our capital allocation framework starts with that commitment to return 75% to 80% of our adjusted FAD back to shareholders via the base, the supplemental. And we do have the flexibility with our framework to use share repurchase as we've done over the last few years. So that portion is really earmarked for returning cash back to shareholders. And with the remaining adjusted FAD, we can allocate that across other opportunities. So as we move forward, I would expect we're likely going to be allocating most of that amount that we have on our balance sheet here in the near term to timberland acquisitions as part of our previously announced plan to purchase $1 billion of timberlands over the next few years. But that said, we do have the flexibility within our capital allocation approach to deploy those cash across the options when we see an opportunity to create value for shareholders.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Devin Stockfish for closing comments.\nDevin Stockfish: Terrific. Well, thanks everyone for joining us this morning and thank you for your continued interest in Weyerhaeuser. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference.

        "article_content": " \n\nIn the Q4 2023 earnings conference call, First Hawaiian, Inc. (NASDAQ:FHB) highlighted a robust quarter with solid customer deposit growth and strong credit quality amidst a resilient local economy. \nThe bank reported a significant gain from the sale of its remaining Visa (NYSE:V) shares and anticipates loan growth in the low-single digits for 2024. With balance sheet adjustments aimed at improving net interest income, First Hawaiian expects a net interest margin of 2.85% in Q1 and an increase over the year despite potential Fed cuts. Investments in technology and personnel have increased expenses but are expected to yield future efficiencies. \nThe bank also announced a $40 million share buyback plan for 2024 and expressed confidence in its ability to navigate the current challenging environment.\nIn summary, First Hawaiian, Inc. is navigating a challenging economic landscape with strategic balance sheet actions and investments in technology and personnel. The bank is balancing the need to manage costs with the potential for growth in various sectors, including commercial real estate and dealer portfolios. With a watchful eye on market conditions and regulatory changes, First Hawaiian is positioning itself for sustained performance in the coming year.\nIn the wake of First Hawaiian, Inc.'s (FHB) optimistic earnings call, a deep dive into the InvestingPro data and tips reveals a nuanced picture of the bank's financial health and stock performance. With a market capitalization of $2.84 billion and a trailing twelve-month P/E ratio of 10.65, the bank trades at a valuation that suggests investors may find it attractive relative to its near-term earnings growth, as indicated by a P/E ratio that is considered low.\nThe gross profit margin appears to be an area of concern for First Hawaiian, as it is deemed weak, which could be a point of consideration for investors looking at the bank's ability to maintain profitability in a challenging environment. Despite this, the bank has shown a strong return over the last three months, with a 24.61% price total return, showcasing resilience in its stock performance.\nInvestingPro Tips suggest that analysts are cautious about the bank's upcoming period, with some having revised their earnings estimates downwards. Nonetheless, the bank is still predicted to be profitable this year, a sentiment that aligns with the positive outlook expressed in their earnings conference call. As of the last twelve months, First Hawaiian has indeed been profitable, which bodes well for its financial stability.\nFor those looking to delve further into First Hawaiian's potential and gain access to more insights, InvestingPro offers additional tips.

Welcome to the First Hawaiian, Inc. Q4 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Kevin Haseyama, Investor Relations Manager.\nKevin Haseyama: Thank you, Josh, and thank you, everyone for joining us as we review our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2023. With me today are Bob Harrison, Chairman, President and CEO; Jamie Moses, Chief Financial Officer; and Lea Nakamura, Chief Risk Officer. We have prepared a slide presentation that we will refer to in our remarks today. The presentation is available for downloading and viewing on our website at fhb.com in the Investor Relations section. During today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements. So please refer to Slide 1 for our safe harbor statement. We may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. The appendix to this presentation contains reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measurements to the most directly comparable GAAP measurements. And now, I'll turn the call over to Bob.\nRobert Harrison: Good morning, everyone. I'll start with a quick overview of the local economy. Overall, Hawaii has been resilient in spite of some headwinds. State payrolls were improving at a modest pace prior to the Maui wildfires, but we're certainly impacted by that disaster. Nevertheless, statewide (ph) unemployment rate remains low. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for December was 2.9% compared to the national unemployment rate of 3.7%. The visitor industry has performed well on a year-to-date basis with the Maui visitor industry recovering faster than expected and visitors to the rest of the state reaching record levels. Through November, total visitor arrivals were 5% higher than last year and total spend was 6.2% higher. Arrivals from Japan continued to increase with year-to-date arrivals at 506,000, up over 220% from the prior year. The housing market remained relatively stable despite reduced activity. In December, the median sales price for a single-family home on Oahu was right about $1 million, which was 5% below December 2022. Median sales prices for condominiums on Oahu was $510,000, 1.5% higher than the previous year. Turning to Slide 2. I'll discuss the highlights of our fourth quarter financial performance. We finished the year with a solid quarter. We continued to grow customer deposits. We believe that net interest margin has bottomed out and credit quality remains excellent. As I'll cover on the next slide, we took balance sheet actions that are immediately additive to earnings. Our return on average tangible assets was 0.81%, and return on average tangible common equity was 13.66%. We continue to maintain strong capital levels with a CET1 ratio of 12.39% and total capital ratio of 13.57%. Turning to Slide 3. I wanted to go over the balance sheet actions we took in the fourth quarter that will reduce earning assets while adding to net interest income. In late December, we sold $526 million of low-yielding investment securities in the loss of $40 million. We intend to use those proceeds to reduce high cost deposit balances starting in the first quarter. By eliminating the negative spread from this asset liability combination, we will improve our net interest margin and generate higher net interest income off lower average earning assets. Capital ratio levels are high, and we have ample liquidity, so we continue to look for opportunities to optimize our balance sheet. We plan to bring down our cash levels to a more normalized range of around $500 million to $600 million. Separately, following the change Visa announced in late 2023 that improve the economics of selling Class B shares, we elected to sell our remaining shares for a gain of about $41 million. The shares were carried on our balance sheet at zero book value. Turning to Slide 4. Period end loans and leases were $14.4 billion, about $21 million higher than September 30. We had good growth in C&I loans, primarily driven by growth in dealer flooring. As we had anticipated, decline in CRE loans was primarily due to the payoff of several completed construction projects. While there is a headwind for balances, it speaks to the quality of the projects, the strength of the sponsors and overall credit quality of the portfolio. The decline in consumer loans was primarily indirect auto. Looking forward to 2024, we expect the full year loan growth rate to be in the low-single digit range. Continued weak demand for residential loans and additional pay downs from our completed construction projects present headwinds to loan growth. Now I'll turn it over to Jamie.\nJames Moses: Thanks, Bob. Turning to Slide 5. Retail and commercial deposits increased by $405 million in total. Commercial deposits were up $243 million and retail deposits increased by $162 million, which allowed us to reduce our reliance on public time deposits. There was no material impact from any Maui recovery related deposit flows. Total deposit balances declined by $179 million due to a $584 million decline in public deposits, $506 million of which were those higher cost time deposits. The percentage of non-interest-bearing deposits to total deposits was a healthy 36%. We expect further reductions in the balances of higher cost public time deposits starting in the first quarter. The rate of increase in deposit costs slowed down in the fourth quarter. Our total cost of deposits was 156 basis points, a 16 basis point increase from the prior quarter. Turning to Slide 6. Net interest income declined by $5.4 million from the prior quarter to $151.8 million due to lower average earning assets and a lower net interest margin. The net interest margin declined by 5 basis points to 2.81%. As we discussed previously, we expect that the security sales and reduction in higher cost deposit balances in Q1 will add about 10 basis points to the 2024 margin and improved net interest income. Our spot NIM in December was 2.75%. So looking forward, we projected NIM in the 2.85% range in Q1. Through the end of the third quarter, the -- fourth quarter, the cumulative betas were 44.6% on interest-bearing deposits and 28.6% on total deposits. On Slide 7, non-interest income was $58.3 million, $12.3 million more than the prior quarter. We had several significant non-recurring items that contributed to the increase. As mentioned previously, we sold a little over 120,000 shares of vis-a-vis stock for a net gain of $40.8 million. We also recognized a net gain of $7.9 million from the sale of a branch property. These were partially offset by the $40 million loss on the previously mentioned sale of securities and another $1.3 million from other miscellaneous segments. Excluding these non-recurring items, non-interest income would have been $50.9 million in the fourth quarter. We expect non-interest income to run about $49 million to $50 million per quarter in 2024. Expenses were $142.3 million, $22.9 million more than the prior quarter. Similar to non-interest income, we had several non-recurring items that drove the increase. The largest item was the $16.3 million FDIC special assessment. We also had several smaller non-recurring expenses totaling about $7.3 million in the quarter. Excluding these items, non-interest expense was about $118.7 million in the fourth quarter. In 2024, we expect full year expenses to be around $500 million, primarily due to continued investment in technology and infrastructure as well as some general inflation. Now I'll turn it over to Lea.\nLea Nakamura: Thank you, Jamie. Moving to Slide 8. The bank maintained its strong credit performance and healthy credit metrics in the fourth quarter. While we have seen some modest deterioration in credit quality, our experienced so far is well within our expectations. We are not observing any broad signs of weakness across either the consumer or commercial books, and we have sufficient loan loss coverage. Commercial criticized assets increased to 1.2% of total loans and leases, driven primarily by a single credit, which was downgraded to special mention, while classified assets fell 2 basis points to 19 basis points of total loans and leases. Year-to-date net charge-offs were $12.2 million. Our annualized year-to-date net charge-off rate was 9 basis points, 3 basis points higher than in the third quarter. Non-performing assets and 90 day past due loans were 15 basis points of total loans and leases at the end of the fourth quarter, up 2 basis points from the prior quarter. And lastly, the bank recorded a $5.3 million provision for the quarter. Moving to Slide 9, we show our fourth quarter allowance for credit losses broken out by disclosure segments. The asset ACL increased $1.7 million to $156.5 million with coverage of 1 basis point to 1.09% of total loans and leases. Turning to Slide 10. We provide a snapshot of our commercial real estate exposure. CRE represents approximately 30% of total loans and leases. The CRE portfolio is well diversified across collateral types, well secured and remains of high quality. Office exposures remained manageable at 5.2% of total loans and leases. We continue to closely monitor the CRE segment given the implications of the rate environment, credit tightening and recessionary headwinds and their follow-on impact to vacancy rates, debt service and asset values. The credit quality of this portfolio remains very good. And now I'll turn it back over to Bob.\nRobert Harrison: Thanks, Lea. In summary, we had a solid quarter. We believe we're well positioned to continue to perform well in a challenging environment. The security sale executed in December will enable us to pay down our higher cost deposits and will immediately improve the margin and net income. Now we'd be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\nSteven Alexopoulos: Hi, everybody.\nRobert Harrison: Hey, Steve.\nJames Moses: Hi. Steve.\nSteven Alexopoulos: I want to start on the margin. You guys said $2.85 is what you expect for the first quarter. And Bob, you said you think you would hit a bottom on the margin. So I'm curious, once we get into the Fed starting to cut rates, where do you see the NIM trending because you are at the sensitive (ph), I believe.\nJames Moses: That's right. I call it sort of moderately asset sensitive off of a flat balance sheet, look, and that still continues to be the case, Steve. The dynamics of the balance sheet today, as it exists, though, we continue to see securities portfolio runoff. And when you look through the numbers there, that's something like a 220 (ph) yield in totality in the portfolio. So we expect about $600 million in cash flow throughout the year off of that. And when you're funding things on the margin, it's 5% or so with public time deposits. That's a pretty significant tailwind in terms of how the margin goes. So when we look at the way that the Fed -- or sorry, the forward curve looks in terms of Fed cuts, it's also kind of laid out later in the year. So we think, generally speaking, the dynamics of the balance sheet allow for the NIM to continue to grind higher over the course of the year, even with that -- even with the way that the forward curve looks.\nSteven Alexopoulos: Okay. That's positive. Could we go a little bit deeper with that. So you guys are not one of the highest deposit rate payers, right? It's a function of our market. But in order to get NIM grinding higher. What's your assumption because I don't know if you're seeing competitors test the market for lower rates already or not. But how quick could you lower your deposit rates once the Fed does start coming down?\nJames Moses: Yeah. So we have a pretty -- the deposit rates, our deposit customer segments are pretty well defined at the moment. And a very large chunk of our customers saw immediate increases to their deposit rates on the way up, and they expect to see those same things on the way down. The amount of that is slightly smaller than what our floating rate assets are. So we are technically asset sensitive there. But we do think that a pretty large chunk of those deposits will reprice lower immediately. And again, Steve, right, the dynamics on the balance sheet, we also have another almost $1.5 billion of fixed rate cash flow that we expect kind of comes off this year as well. And so that gets repriced up higher to today's rates. Even as the Fed is coming down, these rates are still higher than where those were put on. So again, it's not really about asset sensitive or liability sensitive. It's more about kind of dynamics we see on the balance sheet. And there's going to be a function of some lower earning assets as well, but a higher new grind over time.\nSteven Alexopoulos: Got it. Thanks. If I could ask one other question, totally different topic. So it was nice to see the dealer growth in the quarter. Curious where are those balances? And is there still room to catch up or is that now the new normal, like where those balances sit today? Thanks.\nRobert Harrison: Well, Steve, maybe I'll take this one. First, that if you say it enough times, eventually, it's true. So finally, we saw some nice lift in dealer floor plan in Q4, as you saw. The bulk of that is in the Mainland portfolio. It really is driven by -- that has bigger commitments out there, but also driven by a manufacturer base. The domestics have done a better job of bringing back supply the -- more of the imports. Foreign producers have been lagging a bit, but it has been very helpful. So we are seeing those balances grow. So the balance at the end of the year was $563 million in total. That's still just about $300 million less than it was at the end of 2019. So just to give you some perspective.\nSteven Alexopoulos: Still some room.\nRobert Harrison: Yeah, roughly the same commitment, the same basic dealer group. It won\u2019t go back to that. None of us expect it will go back to that. But certainly, there is still some room there.\nRobert Harrison: Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Andrew Liesch with Piper Sandler. You may proceed.\nAndrew Liesch: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions.\nRobert Harrison: Hi, Andrew.\nAndrew Liesch: Just on the expense guidance there, a little bit steeper ramp-up than I was expecting. I guess where are you seeing most of that pressure come in? Is it really just inflation? Is it under contracts? Where is a lot of that expense guide coming from?\nRobert Harrison: Andrew, we were hoping you were going to ask that question. We figured someone. And it really comes down to -- and we've talked about this in pieces and maybe I'll take a couple of minutes to try to wrap it together and give you a better idea of what we been doing for the last couple of years and what we're continuing to invest in. So we're always trying to be very thoughtful on how we're spending our money. And we really have been focused on ever since our core conversion and part of that to enhance our strategy across really three different pillars, and that's data, technology and people. So with what we've been doing over the last couple of years is, we've built out a pretty sophisticated data and analytics platform. We've also increased our capabilities with a lot of different things, including AI. As I think we've talked about before, we've already incorporated AI into our consumer lending, and that's been very positive for us. But we're also making strides in our digital offerings. We did the conversion of our online consumer banking last summer, it went very well. We are going to open or put in place a new digital account opening platform in probably mid-year of this year. And we've built out our in-house engineering capabilities, which is really based on open AI architecture. And then finally, we're putting in a new CRM. So all of that has been done. We feel most of those investments are in place. As that kind of comes into the income statement, it rises our costs a little bit more than we thought. You can see our employment numbers are basically flat. So we are adding more people, but we are investing in our people because we have put in place a pretty sophisticated engineering team to be able to do things in-house. And so why are we doing all that? We think that's really going to position us well for the future. To be competitive in our market and our unique deposit market to give our customers a lot more options going forward than we have done in the past, and I think really be a first mover in the market. So that's driving a lot of the same number of people, a number of investments in platforms and technology that is really at the end of that and then some inflation, etc., in there as well. But Jamie, anything you would add to that?\nJames Moses: I think that's a really good summary, Bob. The only other thing to add, Andrew, is we recognize the number is probably a little bit higher than what you were expecting and others have been expecting. But we think it's important that we do invest in those things. And as Bob kind of alluded to in his comments -- commentary, over time, this rate of growth should come down because these investments ought to be able to create scale and efficiencies for us. So that's part of the investment that we've been making and we'll continue this year.\nRobert Harrison: And just to add to that, good point, Jamie. As we finish up the new stuff, we will be sunsetting the outdated systems and improving our operating methods and everything else to bring down our costs and optimize our expenses. So we are kind of the transition between having invested in new platforms and as those mature and rolling off old stuff. So there's a little bit of that going on in 2024 as well, which builds into that number.\nAndrew Liesch: Got it. So I guess once you move past, what would be -- do you think is like a natural level of expense growth for the company then?\nJames Moses: Yeah. I mean I think that's probably natural level 2%, 3%, something like that would be the natural level, inflationary sort of expectations. That's in the future like when we get past this in 2024.\nAndrew Liesch: Great. That\u2019s very helpful. I\u2019ll step back. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Timur Braziler with Wells Fargo. You may proceed.\nTimur Braziler: Hi. Good morning. Looking at the expectations for cash flows off of the bond book at $600 million, how much of that is going to be used to continue working down some of the higher cost funding? And I guess at what point does that stop and you actually start reinvesting some of those proceeds back into the bond book?\nJames Moses: I think the cash flow is coming off, we're going to do two things, right? So number one is immediately to pay off higher cost deposits to the extent we can. And then the other side of that is fund loan growth as well. So to the extent that -- we love to have a higher rate of loan growth, to the extent that, that happens, we could -- that could be part of the story as well. But I think for us, at the moment, it's really kind of paying off those public time deposits that we have. So those tend to be -- those are in sort of the 5% range right now. And even if you take -- I don't know, if take a little bit of credit risk in the bond book, the yields are something like 530, 540 (ph), if you want. So you have the spread there between the funding cost and the yield is not very high. And so we're not really excited in reinvesting in the bond book right now when we'll be funding that on the margins of 5%. So for now, it's kind of just kind of run off mode.\nTimur Braziler: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe looking at the linked quarter reduction in non-interest bearing, I'm just wondering if there's any visibility to how much excess liquidity you think is within that line item and how much additional mix shift we may get out of non-interest-bearing into some of the interest-bearing accounts over the next two quarters or so?\nJames Moses: Yeah. We don't know, Timur. We started pre-pandemic. We were at about 36% non-interest-bearing to total deposits, and that's where we're at right now. So I wouldn't say that it can't go lower from here. Anything is -- obviously, anything is possible. We would expect to see in an elevated rate environment, we would expect to see some continued migration. We're monitoring that. We're looking through that, and that's obviously part of asset liability management decisions that we'll make throughout this year and on a go-forward basis. We could see some migration -- continued migration on that, but we think it's -- we think that the sort of rate of deceleration has changed and should be less rapid on a go forward.\nTimur Braziler: Great. I guess last for me, just TCE rebounded north of 6% here, regulatory capital looks pretty good. Any reconsideration for buyback or any incremental thoughts on initiating a buyback?\nRobert Harrison: Yeah. Timur, this is Bob. Yes, we did get approval from the Board for a $40 million buyback plan for 2024, so that is available to us. And that will be certainly something we're considering. We are above the kind of 12% CET1 number that we've been talking about the last several years. There's still -- we feel a reasonable amount of uncertainty in the environment. We're not yet up on a year from the failures of those three banks. So we\u2019re going to be a little bit cautious, but we\u2019re certainly very aware of being comfortable with our capital levels, having the ability to do share repurchase during 2024. And we\u2019re just going to continue to look at that and evaluate it as we go through the year.\nTimur Braziler: Great. Thanks for the questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Kelly Motta with KBW. You may proceed.\nKelly Motta: Hi. Thank you so much for the question.\nRobert Harrison: Hey, Kelly.\nKelly Motta: Hey. Maybe I don't think we talk yet much about credit, obviously, metrics remain really strong. Just wondering what you're watching at this stage, any changes in how you're viewing certain portfolios? And any kind of expectations for what credit normalization could look like over the next two years or so?\nRobert Harrison: Kelly, great question, and maybe I'll start and then turn it over to Lea. We're watching that very closely. Some of the office issues we talked about mid-year last year have been resolved. There's still no -- that's area of high attention that we are paid to it not only on the credit side, but also the line officers. We continue to stay very close to the customers in the commercial side, but in particular, the commercial real estate. As I mentioned in the comments, there is some normal function going on. We are getting paid off from construction deals. They had moved from construction into mini-perm as they got fully leased up, which for a little while there, a couple of years ago, you recall they were just getting paid off as soon as construction completed. So it's now back to a more normal environment to me, which is healthy. On the rest of the commercial side, we're still seeing strength in a lot of the areas that we talked about. Consumer, we are starting to see a little bit of weakness for the indirect and cards, but kind of back to normal in a sense. And maybe a last comment before I turn it over to Lea is, as she mentioned in her comments, just to highlight, we haven't really seen a lot of impact from Maui. So something as well we're watching closely. But Lea, anything you'd add to that?\nLea Nakamura: No, I don't really have much to add. What I will say, though, is we actually are quite pleased with the performance of the portfolio even in this environment. We continue to watch certain pieces very carefully because you hear about the headline numbers and you think about how it impacts our borrowers. But so far, we really haven't seen the kind of, I guess, weakness that we thought we would at this time in the cycle.\nKelly Motta: I really appreciate all the color here, guys. Maybe one more from me. Just wondering if you've evaluated the regulatory proposals interchange and overdraft and kind of if you started to make any preliminary estimates on what the impact could be to you and if you're doing any changes with your fee structure in response to that?\nRobert Harrison: On the interchange side, we haven't done a full analysis, Kelly. I mean, it's something we're looking at, something we don't agree with, basically, in principle, and we're supporting the ABA's (ph) position and the standard taking in that. So I think that's important. We're evaluating it from a mid-size bank coalition perspective as well and will likely support it, but the ABA is positioned because -- but having said that, we're also starting to do the analysis of what it would be because we have to be responsive to it. It is in the rule-making process, which means it will take some time to come into effect and not knowing exactly what the final outcome will be. We're still kind of waiting to get a better idea because doing the analysis, I think, is fairly straightforward once we have an idea of what the final will be.\nKelly Motta: Great. Thank you. I\u2019ll step back. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Christian DeGrasse with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.\nChristian DeGrasse: Hi. Thanks for the question. Putting the public deposits to the side for a second, can you maybe provide some context on how your commercial and retail deposit rates have performed alongside the rising rate cycle and how you expect repricing to react relative to that when rates ultimately start to fall?\nJames Moses: Yeah. For the most part, again, I guess, Christian, I'll just kind of go back into it, we have kind of a few different segments the way we think about in both the retail and the commercial side of the world. And there's a segment or a portion of balances that's rate sensitive, and there's a portion that's there for operating accounts and EDA working capital, that kind of thing. And so on the way up, they got the benefit of rates on the way up pretty much in a 100% kind of beta scenario. And so on the way down, that the expectations are very similar that we would be able to reduce those rates as well. Again, the portion of deposits that we have that are in that 100% beta is probably -- like if you think about it around numbers, it's probably like 80% of what our floating rate loans are. So in a kind of a down rate scenario, there will be an immediate reprice of loans that are -- that is a little bit higher than what our deposits are, but a substantial amount of those deposits will also tick down as well. So in totality, we kind of just think that, that's where we're at in terms of the mix, and we'll be able to manage those rates down over time pretty well.\nRobert Harrison: And just to add to Jamie's comments, as I think we talked about it's been several quarters. We were talking to our customers or those segments, the high net worth, mass affluent, corporate, when we were increasing rates on the way out. And we\u2019ve continued those conversations, the expectation is when rates go the other way, that there won\u2019t be a lag, that we will be working with them on the way down as well. So that\u2019s been very well communicated by our bankers to the customers. So we think that\u2019s a doable thing. We are not seeing much deposit pressures in the market, to be honest.\nChristian DeGrasse: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Andrew Liesch with Piper Sandler. You may proceed.\nAndrew Liesch: Hey. Thanks for taking the follow-up here. Sorry to keep bringing up expenses. But what's the quarterly trajectory, how do you expect these costs to play out this year?\nJames Moses: So it's always slightly elevated Q1, just extra taxes and things like that, just true-up things happen in Q1, but in totality is probably going to be generally flat across the year. And so that's kind of the way that we have it, looked into my model of it. So generally pretty flat, maybe slightly elevated.\nAndrew Liesch: Got it. So more seasonally adjusted stuff during the first quarter, then more of the investment starting to ramp up and then offset some of those seasonal adjustments as they fall off as the year goes on?\nJames Moses: Yeah, I think that's a truly good way of looking at it.\nAndrew Liesch: Got it. Okay. Thanks so much. I appreciate it.\nJames Moses: Yeah.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Kevin Haseyama for any closing remarks.\nKevin Haseyama: Thank you. We appreciate your interest in First Hawaiian, and please feel free to contact me if you have any additional questions.

Welcome to Western Alliance Bancorporation's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. You may also view the presentation today via webcast through the Company's website at www.westernalliancebancorporation.com. I would now like to turn the call over to Miles Pondelik, Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Development. Please go ahead.\nMiles Pondelik: Thank you, and welcome to Western Alliance Bank's fourth quarter 2023 conference call. Our speakers today are Ken Vecchione, President and Chief Executive Officer; Dale Gibbons, Chief Financial Officer; and Tim Bruckner, Chief Banking Officer will join for Q&A. Before I hand the call over to Ken, please note that today's presentation contains forward-looking statements which are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Except as required by law, the Company does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements. For more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties that cause the actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements, please refer to the Company's SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed yesterday, which are available on the Company's website. Now, for opening remarks, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken Vecchione.\nKen Vecchione: Thank you, Miles, and good morning, everyone. I'll make some brief comments about our fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings before turning the call over to Dale, who will review our financial results in more detail. After I discuss our 2024 outlook, Tim Bruckner will join us as usual for Q&A. Western Alliance's diversified national commercial business strategy continued to drive strong momentum in the fourth quarter, as we generated earnings per share of $1.33 or $1.91 excluding $0.58 of one-time notable items. The quarter featured both healthy balance sheet growth, and additional balance sheet repositioning actions to further optimize our funding base. Looking past these notable items which Dale will explain shortly, highlights for the quarter included solid loan and deposit growth, ongoing capital and liquidity accumulation, and continued stable asset quality. Deposit growth of $1 billion allowed us to continue to selectively reduce debt and borrowings. In Q4, we fully repaid $1.3 billion of advances from the Bank Term Funding Program, as well as a $300 million 6.5% AmeriHome Senior Notes, which were not replaced with new borrowings. Regarding the AmeriHome Notes, we seized an opportunity to repay this higher-cost debt at a discount. Additionally, our portion of the industry-wide FDIC special assessment to replenish the Deposit Insurance Fund totaled $66.3 million. Loans rose $850 million in the quarter, bolstered by C&I growth within our regional footprint. Western Alliance begins 2024 supported by a strong capital base and liquidity position. CET1 expanded approximately 150 basis points during the year to 10.8%, which equates to 9.8% when including AOCI. 80% of our deposits are either insured or collateralized, which ranks among the highest levels of the 50 largest U.S. banks. Despite the industry's challenges, our total deposits increased 3% year-over-year. Asset quality also remains in very good shape. We've limited net charge-offs of only 6 basis points of average loans in 2023. Limited realized losses amidst a normalized credit backdrop is indicative, in our view, of the merits of lending with low advance rates adhering to conservative underwriting standards, and approaching credit mitigation proactively. Continuing to shift our funding base from borrowings to core deposits, better positions us to grow loans in a rate environment in flux likely to decline later this year. We have made investments and leadership additions in order to drive increased C&I growth in our regional footprint, expand fee income opportunities across client relationships, and complement the growth of our national business lines, particularly our leading national -- our leading deposit focus verticals. Overall in 2024, we look forward to consistent balance sheet and PPNR growth, with higher liquidity and improving capital. This will empower Western Alliance to continue partnering with our clients on their most important projects. Dale will now take you through the financial performance. Afterwards, I will provide you with our 2024 outlook.\nDale Gibbons: Well, thank you, Ken. For the year, Western Alliance produced net revenue of $2.6 billion, net income of $722 million, and EPS of $6.54. Net revenue increased 3% from the prior year, demonstrating the durability and flexibility of our business model. Net interest income rose $123 million or approximately 6% to over $2.3 billion, notwithstanding our curtailed loan growth and the completion of a series of asset sales earlier in the year. Non-interest income declined $44 million to $281 million for repositioning actions, the impact of fair value marks, as well as the slower mortgage purchase market. Non-interest expense of $1.6 billion, increased $466 million year-over-year, primarily due to higher earnings credit rates and deposit costs driven by the rising rate environment. Moving on to fourth quarter trends and business drivers, we generated reported pre-provision net revenue of $220 million, net income of $148 million, and EPS of $1.33. As part of the balance sheet optimization efforts conducted earlier to support and improve our earnings trajectory, we repaid $300 million of AmeriHome Senior Notes at a discount. We utilized this gain to better position the balance sheet by selling securities, as well as MSR fair-value adjustments in sales, which combined to produce a pre-tax loss of $4.5 million, in addition to the $66 million FDIC special assessment. When excluding these one-time notable items, we generated adjusted net income of $211 million and EPS of $1.91. Net interest income increased $4.7 million during the quarter to $592 million, from higher average earning asset balances and reduced higher-cost borrowings. GAAP non-interest income was $91 million, or excluding notable items a $126 million, which was down approximately $3 million from Q3. During the quarter, loans sold approximately $200 million of Mortgage Servicing Rights, which improved our capital ratios despite incurring a loss of $11 million on disposition. As prepayment speeds began to recover from historically low levels, the valuation of Mortgage Servicing Rights moved lower at an accelerated pace, which resulted in a $14 million fair-value adjustment net of hedging. We don't believe this aggregate $25 million charge is indicative of the earnings profile of our Mortgage Banking business. Lock volumes rebounded 29% year-over-year and may be indicative of continued momentum into 2024. Since the December rate rally and resulting lower mortgage rates, we have experienced incremental refinance volume and firming margins. Should mortgage rates trend lower in future quarters, we would expect this business to benefit which has not been captured in our go-forward guidance. Additionally, income from equity investments was elevated by approximately $8 million due to outsized gains from solar tax credit investments with higher-than-expected performance during the quarter. GAAP non-interest expense was $462 million, or excluding noted items, $435 million, a quarterly increase of $9 million. Deposit cost growth slowed markedly, increasing $3 million in Q4 as our Settlement Services and Homeowners Association businesses experienced strong growth in new customers that have surpassed seasonal declines in Mortgage Warehouse. Provision expense was $9.3 million, reflecting steady asset quality. Lastly, our effective tax rate of approximately 30% was temporarily elevated in Q4 primarily because of timing issues related to the low-income housing units that were not placed into service in 2023. The 2024 tax rate should reset at 22% to 23%. Loans Held For Investment grew $850 million to $50.3 billion, while deposits increased $1 billion to $55.3 billion at quarter-end. Mortgage Servicing Rights declined to $1.1 billion from MSR sales and reduced valuations resulting from the lower rate environment. Overall, we continue to build high-quality liquid asset levels and on-balance sheet liquidity via strong deposit growth. Debt repayments previously discussed, reduced investments in cash by $351 million from September 30th. Strong deposit growth over the last three quarters has allowed us to cut total borrowings and debt by half from the end of Q1. Finally, tangible book value per share increased $3.06 or 7% over the prior quarter, and 16% year-over-year to $46.72 from retained earnings and reduced drag from negative all other comprehensive income. Loans Held For Investment growth was predominantly from C&I categories, some of which we're moving at higher-end line utilization. Construction and land loans were up $220 million with a little under half of this contribution from lot banking. Given the national undersupply of homes and a greater likelihood of near-term rate cuts, we are still positive about the macroeconomics for this business. Deposit growth of $1 billion was achieved despite typical seasonal declines in Mortgage Warehouse deposits related to tax and insurance payments. We continue to experience broad-based growth from our specialized value-added deposit channels. HOA had its best Q4 ever and we believe it will retain and possibly extend its leading market share in the country as achieved in Q3 of last year. Settlement Services, Tech and Innovation, Corporate Trust, and our Digital Consumer Channel, all grew materially and contributed to well-diversified growth. Non-interest-bearing DDA comprised 26% of total deposits, of which 45% have no cash payment of earnings credits. The decline in non-interest-bearing balances was primarily driven by the expected $3 billion decrease from typical Mortgage Warehouse seasonality of property tax and insurance escrow funds. There has been no client attrition associated with these outflows and this decline is recovering as anticipated this quarter. Moving on to net interest drivers, HFI loan yield decreased 8 basis points due to the full quarter impact of the $1.3 billion reclassification of loans from Held For Sale to Held For Investment at the end of Q3. This coincided with -- coincidently resulted in Held For Sale yields climbing 31 basis points. Going forward, we anticipate HFI yields to continue to be supported by an average of $2.9 billion of loans repricing or maturing third quarter in 2024. The yields on total investments expanded 8 basis points in Q4 to 4.99%. The Securities portfolio grew $1.9 billion to $13 billion from the ongoing HQLA goal, which has increased treasury from $900 million at the end of Q1 last year to approximately $4.9 billion at year-end. The cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 7 basis points, markedly slower than the prior quarter, and the total cost of funds increased 2 basis points to 2.82% due to an increase in demand deposits and lower short-term borrowings. Deposit growth enabled the $768 million increase, a reduction in average short-term borrowings, as well as 6 basis points of improvement in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. In aggregate, net interest income increased approximately $5 million, while the net interest margin of 3.65% came in at the mid-point of our Q4 guidance. Our net interest income growth was exceeded by the growth rate of average earning assets. Non-interest expenses were impacted by $27 million at net notable items this quarter. Adjusting for these one-time items, as well as deposit costs, our adjusted efficiency ratio rose 100 basis points to 51%. We expect deposit costs will experience relief from a cessation of rate hikes and should fall as rates decline. For historical context, average ECR balances were $19.9 billion in the fourth quarter compared to $17 billion in Q3 and $15.4 billion in Q4 of '22. We expect ECR-related deposits to remain a consistent relative proportion of our deposit base as total deposits grow. Based upon our rate forecast and generally a high beta repricing for ECR-related deposits, we expect such pricing to largely decline and lockstep with the rate cuts, offsetting any potential net interest margin declines. Asset quality metrics continue to remain stable and in line with what we reported last quarter. The aggregate net increase in Special Mention loans and classified assets was only $7 million from the Q3 level. Non-performing assets increased to $281 million, equating to 40 basis points of total assets, which is 5 basis points above the third quarter. Quarterly net loan charge-offs were $8.5 million, or 7 basis points of average loans, which was aligned with Q3 net charge-offs. Provision expense of $9.3 million was a function of loan growth and has slightly improved Moody's (NYSE:MCO) consensus forecast. Though our consensus and some early risk ratings for our ACL still incorporated 80% recessionary outlook. Our allowance increased $10 million from the prior quarter to $337 million and the ACL ratio with 73 basis points covered a 135% of non-performing loans. Looking at the reserve block, you'll see an updated look on the context behind our allowance, which when considering insured loans and those in no-loss categories, the allowance shifts up to 1.31% of loans. Our CET1 ratio rose 20 basis points to 10.8% or 9.8% when adjusted for the AOCI debit. Our tangible common equity to total assets grew approximately 50 basis points from Q3 to 7.3%, from earnings and the improved AOCI position. Tangible book value per share increased $3.06 from Q3 to $46.72 from earnings and recapture of AOCI marks. The $220 million improvement in AOCI resulted from substantial decreases in intermediate-term treasury rates during the quarter. Our consistent upward trajectory in tangible book value per share has outpaced peers by almost 5 times from 2013, including strong growth in 2023. Over most time periods, Western Alliance continues to generate a top-quartile total shareholder return relative to both asset-light peers and the Regional Banking index. Turning the call back to Ken.\nKen Vecchione: Thanks, Dale. Our guidance for 2024 is to build on the second-half momentum of 2023 and progress towards returning to above-industry returns. In the first half of 2024, the Company will emphasize liquidity growth over loan growth, drive capital above 11%, and further build our HQLA portfolio, which will temper earnings growth for the first half of the year. As these goals are achieved, earnings momentum will accelerate in the second half of 2024 and into 2025. So, for the full year of 2024, we expect continued thoughtful balance sheet growth driven by our diversified business model, with an origination mix designed to drive net interest income above 2023 levels. Loan and core deposits are expected to grow $2 billion and $8 billion respectively for the year. Core deposits-driven growth should continue to push our loan-to-deposit ratio towards the mid-80% level by the middle of this year. Regarding capital, we are targeting a CET1 ratio above 11%, reflecting steady organic capital accumulation in concert with balance sheet growth. Net interest income should grow 5% to 10% from a Q4 2023 annualized jumping-off point. This forecast assumes four 25 basis point cuts back-loaded in the year. We expect any future NIM compression resulting from the rate cuts to be matched by comparable deposit cost declines in non-interest expense, which will be accretive to earnings. Non-interest income should increase 10% to 20% from an adjusted 2023 baseline level of $397 million, which excludes 2023's mark-to-market adjustments and the impact of asset sales, as we prioritize growing commercial banking-related fee income from holistic customer relationships. Mortgage banking-related income will be somewhat dependent on the rate environment and mortgage buying -- I should say, and mortgage buying. But we're encouraged that with the recent low rate environment, application volume is picking up with firmer margins thus far in early 2024. Non-interest expense, inclusive of the ECR-related deposit costs, should rise only 0% to 2% from an annualized adjusted Q4 baseline of $1.740 billion and allow for continued operating leverage. In aggregate, these factors will enable WAL to consistently grow PPNR throughout the year. Asset quality remains manageable and projects continue -- and we project continued support from our sponsors. Based on our conservative underwriting and low advance rates, net charge-offs are expected to be 10 basis points to 15 basis points for the year as the economic cycle normalizes. Lastly, we expect the effective tax rate to revert between 22% and 23% starting in Q1. At this time, Tim, Dale, and I are happy to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from Casey Haire of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nCasey Haire: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So, I wanted to start on the four cuts and how that impacts the PPNR guide. Obviously, it hits you guys a number of ways. Dale, I think you said that it does not -- your fees does not account for any upside in mortgage banking. It sounds like the deposit costs within expenses are 100% beta. Can you just confirm that? And then, the four cuts, how would that -- what kind of deposit beta are you expecting for the non-ECR component, and how that would impact NII?\nDale Gibbons: Yes. In aggregate, I mean to getting to PPNR, the net impact is fairly nominal. I mean, as we've indicated in the past, if you just look at net interest income, we're modestly asset-sensitive. So, that would be a little bit of a decrement. But of course, you alluded to the ECR price deposits, which we expect to fall and fall in line. Yes, so put those together, we think we're getting now modestly liability-sensitive and we have a net benefit then in PPNR, excluding the AmeriHome piece which is the option on -- this is a call option if things get much better and that's good space.\nCasey Haire: So, AmeriHome would be gravy if it did, but obviously, if it's back-half-loaded, it might be modest.\nDale Gibbons: Yes. So, the mix will look a little different. I mean, if you had a more accelerated rate decline, maybe you're going to see a faster decline perhaps in net interest income, reflecting the net interest income profile that we have. But again, when you layer-in the deposit costs, I think it's going to eliminate that.\nCasey Haire: Okay. And then, so the loan-to-deposit growth guide for '24, you've got $613 million of liquidity to play with. What is the plan for that? Build the bond book? Build cash? Pay down borrowings? Just wondering what your plans are there.\nDale Gibbons: Yes. So, when I think about the year, I think about it -- the first half of the year, we're building the liquidity profile as you mentioned. With that, we're really going to build our HQLA portfolio. And we're looking to drive our loan-to-deposit ratio as I just said, in the mid-80%s. From there, it's growth towards a much bigger and better 2025. So, we need to continue to reposition ourselves. We think we'll have that done by the end of the second quarter. And then, it will be a little bit more traditional earnings as you see them -- as you have seen them historically from us. But, I would say -- and when you think about it, the deposit and loans are more coming in across the year in a ratable fashion, about $500 million per quarter for loans and approximately $2 billion per quarter for deposits.\nCasey Haire: Got you. Thank you. And then just last one. Dale, you mentioned the DDA. It sounds like it's recovering seasonally within Mortgage Warehouse, just any update you can share on how much of that $3 billion has come back in?\nDale Gibbons: Well, so, it's really based upon the semi-annual property tax payments, largely in California. And so, we would expect that we're going to get half of that or two-thirds of that this quarter. And then the rest of it would start coming in. The payments due in May are less dramatic in terms of kind of the dip that we see. Meanwhile, other Warehouse funds look to be growing consistently, and we're also off to a good start in our HOA business for Q1.\nKen Vecchione: Casey, let me just add, right now we're on track to beat the $2 billion for our Q1. And that's inclusive of the HOA deposits coming back in.\nCasey Haire: Great. Thanks, guys.\nDale Gibbons: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos from J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nSteven Alexopoulos: Hi, everybody. I wanted to start on the margin. So, you were 3.65% in the quarter, right in the middle of what you had guided to. Dale, for you, how should we think about the NIM trending the backdrop of four cuts? And then it's funny, when I look at where the NIM was when we had a more normal curve, I mean, you guys were like 4.50%, but this is a completely different balance sheet today. So, assuming we eventually get a normal curve, normal level rates, like what's a reasonable NIM for this balance sheet?\nKen Vecchione: So, hello, Steve, it's Ken. What I would say is, again, thinking about the year, the first two quarters of the year, NIM should track consistent with our Q4 NIM of 3.65%. And then Q3 and Q4, the NIM will gently roll down as the price -- as the rate cuts come into play. But offsetting that NIM decline will be the reduction in ECR expenses.\nDale Gibbons: So, what's transpired is, we have and we expect to continue to have considerably more liquidity on the balance sheet, and that is going to kind of depress NIM at basically a permanent basis. Where can we be kind of going forward, I think we can be close to kind of where we are. So, maybe the 3.5% range is kind of sustainable kind of over kind of a broader economic cycle than what we have seen. We'll probably have a little bit better return on the Residential portfolio that we presently have. But for the most part, I think our numbers rather than being in the 4%s, I think we're destined for the 3%-level here going forward.\nSteven Alexopoulos: Got it.\nDale Gibbons: Preamble.\nSteven Alexopoulos: Okay. And then on the expense guide, so you guys were $437 million on the ECR deposit cost in '23, what's assumed within this expense guidance for 2024 for the cost of ECR deposits, like where is that roughly?\nDale Gibbons: Yes. So, that's fairly -- it's fairly stable, and so we get to -- as we indicated earlier, we have a back-end-loaded forecast starting in June in the rate and so that would kind of curtail based upon kind of how that plays out.\nKen Vecchione: That's something that -- we don't do\u2026\nSteven Alexopoulos: Go ahead.\nKen Vecchione: Steve, you're on a choppy line a little bit, Steve. But, I would say, to Dale's point -- you there?\nSteven Alexopoulos: Yes. I'm here.\nKen Vecchione: Got you. I would say, just keep in mind, you're either thinking about -- your question is based on total dollars and so, while rate will be coming down, total dollars may still rise as we continue to push off on deposit growth. So, just keep in mind the rate volume impact there. Okay?\nSteven Alexopoulos: Yes. Got it. Okay. Ken, can I just finally ask you a big-picture question? So, when I look at the Company, right, years back, we had the financial crisis and you guys made quite a few changes after that, right, built-out national businesses, you had top-decile growth for a long time. Then we had March Madness, you again pivoted, right, you made adjustments, pushing up insured deposits, chained-in liquidity, et cetera. When I look at the 2024 guide, it looks like more of the same in the first-half, but then when we get to the second-half of the year and then 2025, what does this company then look like? Do you throttle up loan growth from where we are? Do you throttle that deposit growth? Are you back to a growth Bank? Like, how you see the world right now and a longer-term for the Company? Thanks.\nKen Vecchione: Yes. Good question. We started to pivot by the way in the third quarter of 2022 with higher liquidity and higher capital. And we certainly were very happy that we did. As we entered March Madness, it really served us well. And that's informed our decision-making as to why we want to keep that moving forward. And as you said, we'll have that basically completed by the first half of 2024. Then, I think what you're going to see is a little bit of the same Bank, but I don't think we're going to put our foot on the accelerator as hard as we used to put -- push down on the throttle there. And one reason is, we never got really paid for that. So, up until the end of 2022, we were probably growing deposits and loans about 24% to 25% per year and we didn't see that in our evaluation. And in fact, people always got nervous with that and said, geez, there must be a credit problem that was lurking behind, but really over that period of time, we only had $29 million of net losses. So, what we're going to do is, we're going to be targeting for above-industry trend growth going forward in the back-half of '24 and into '25, and we think we'll get rewarded for that, and takeaway concerns that they'll always linger about going way back even to 2006 and '07 and '08, that people bring up and I think we'll run from there. But we should be higher in our return on equity, higher on return on assets, but not to the old levels of coming back to 2010 to 2013, 2014, 2015. Okay?\nSteven Alexopoulos: Got it. Yes. That's great color. Thanks for taking my questions.\nKen Vecchione: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Hey, good morning.\nKen Vecchione: Good morning.\nEbrahim Poonawala: I guess maybe just one bigger-picture question around earnings. If I have the math right, in terms of your earnings outlook, you probably shake-out on $8 in EPS for '24, should we expect EPS to dip in the first half before re-accelerating in the back half of the year? How do you think about earnings growth relative to the $1.91 you printed in the fourth quarter? Just given the moving pieces around what you're doing with HQLA, the benefit of rate cuts in the back half, I would love to hear just the earnings trajectory that you are looking at.\nDale Gibbons: That's a good -- that's a really good question, Ebrahim So -- and maybe implicitly in your comments, so the first quarter generally does have a dip and you can see this in prior years, but as we get to 4Q -- and some of it is diesel, or we pay some higher fiber costs. Of course, there's a fewer number of days in Q1. So, as we get into that, that should be -- that should have a bit of a softer point at the beginning of the year. Moving into Q2 and Q1, it's going to be impacted by what Ken was talking about in terms of continuing to build out and finish by the end of the second quarter, early in the third, our HQLA position there. So, that would result in a little lower earnings growth during those first two periods as basically the deposit growth, which we think is going to be fairly strong, is diverted into an asset class that doesn't yield as much. As that changes and as the loan-to-deposit ratio is in the 80%s, you're going to find this by the -- by summer, that's going to be a more proportionate growth rate in loans, as well as deposits, and hence, you do get a growth rate picking up through the end of '24 and carrying into '25.\nEbrahim Poonawala: That's helpful. And I guess the other question, you mentioned about never getting paid on the -- for loan growth back in the day. When we think about how you are acquiring and what type of deposits you are acquiring today, may Ken, is it different? Means, you've obviously emphasized the regions and the deposit growth from the regions, but I'm just wondering if your view around large chunky deposits has changed given sort of the emphasis on liquidity? And as a result of that, should we expect you to kind of go about differently when it comes to deposit growth and client acquisition?\nKen Vecchione: Yes. So, Ebrahim, thanks for the question and I think your question is insightful because that's how we're changing around the business. So, we've been working on a number of new deposit verticals that are really getting legs behind them. And the first is Settlement Services. And just this quarter alone, we grew Settlement Services $2.1 billion. And so, there the deposits are a little larger and -- but the growth rate is steady and consistent. So, as you get to a certain level, large deposits will flow off and then you got to bring on the large deposits in. Additionally, we have our business escrow and Corporate Trust business and that too is beginning to get some legs. And in this quarter, that grew by $350 million. Now, that business will continue to grow, but it really will be helped once we get our investment-grade ratings back. And go back to the pivot, the pivot is to get to our investment-grade ratings, so that Corporate Trust could be a bigger contributor to our deposits and we think with an overall 11% CET1 ratio, mid-80%s loan-to-deposit ratio, steady asset quality, we will position ourselves to get upgraded there. Now, HOA, it's been a long -- actually, what was probably our first national business line, and that continues to knock the ball out of the park. And usually, what is a slow quarter, the fourth that is, they grew $300 million. For the year, they grew about $1.2 billion and those are steady, smaller deposits. They come in from either new business that we win and the existing clients growing their book of business. So, we get that two ways. Then, another business that we are very pleased with was the one we started in early January, January 4th of 2023, which is our Consumer Digital Platform. This quarter alone, that brought in nearly $800 million. And that's been a real home run for us and that's where we see deposits more in $53,000 to $57,000 range for each client. Now for -- going forward in '24 into '25, we're going to try to shift the platform from an outside vendor to an internal platform. And so, we're going to probably run two platforms for a while as we come up to speed with our own platform. But that will help us also longer-term and it will reduce, not in '24, but going forward '25 and '26, it will reduce some of our maintenance expenses. And then, last but not least, let's not forget what we are in our traditional ball game here and that is the regions, and we've been rethinking and redesigning the regions, that was the reason why we moved Tim out of his Chief Credit Officer role into the Chief Banking Officer for the regions. That's why we brought in Lynne Herndon to take over the Chief Credit Officer role and Tim's charge is to rethink and re-imagine the regions and how to be more C&I-focused. And with that focus in C&I, of course, there'll be more deposits. And I should mention that $600 million came in this quarter from the regions as well in deposits. But it will also help us grow our fee income. And so, we're going to get a two for there over the long term. It will be easier to bring in the deposits first and then that fee income as we continue to sell or cross-sell our Treasury Management Services, will help us towards the back-end of '24, but again pick up some steam into the new year of 2025. So, I hope that kind of gives you a sense of what we've been doing, and we're looking at some other deposit verticals that are just early, early stages and we'll probably work on them this year and hope to have them ready to go either in the back-end of '24 or early '25.\nEbrahim Poonawala: So, that is helpful. Thanks for the rundown, Ken. And what I didn't hear was, does this change at all your view around doing any Bank M&A where you pick up a retail franchise, bring in another deposit sort of generating engine or is that not kind of part of the equation today?\nKen Vecchione: So, today, it's not part of the equation. We're not talking about M&A at all. You know, again, we're talking about 11% CET1, kind of move that upward. But it will at some point -- the M&A question or conversation will come into play as we continue to get bigger and bigger. We kind of do what we think we're going to do with deposits, then, where that will be brought into play as we approach a $100 billion. But frankly, that's a premature conversation at this point. I think we still have a couple of years before we get to a $100 billion.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Clark of Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Clark: Hey, good morning, everyone. Just the first one on the loan growth guide, $2 billion of -- $500 million a quarter, is that -- we had previously talked about maybe some acceleration in loan growth in the second half, is that just you all being a little conservative and then again either to start the year or should we not necessarily expect a step-up in loan growth in the second-half?\nKen Vecchione: So, you know, the further we take, Q4, we thought loan growth was going to be doing zero on the $300 million, and so, we were a little surprised that it came in at $850 million. I'd rather be surprised on the upside as a general trend, but we're still going to be a little cautious about economic activity going forward. And so, we're going to be mindful of this recession or slowdown that only at least advertised to come but has not shown up yet. And then, we have sort of deemphasized certain asset classes for now, those being obviously CRE office and residential just to name the two, some construction areas as well. And so, we're just going to stay with the guide of $500 million a quarter. We think that's reasonable. And if the liquidity comes in faster than we think, then we'll look to deploy it in loan growth. As a general rule, we've never had problem deploying our liquidity and getting good, safe, sound, and thoughtful loan growth.\nMatthew Clark: Okay. And then, on the fee income guide, if you look at the fourth quarter run rate, I think would you make the fair-value adjustments, that exclude the Securities losses. I'm coming up with a run rate closer to a $124 million, correct me if I'm wrong. And you annualize that, you're talking about call it $492 million and your guide at the mid-point is roughly $457 off the last year's base. So, maybe correct me if I'm wrong on that $124 million, and if it is -- but if that is correct, it only implies -- it implies you're down 7% this year and obviously, you talked about not assuming any uptick in Mortgage, but just want to get the puts and takes there of what we might not be thinking about.\nDale Gibbons: Well, so we have a few things going on in the -- on the non-interest income side, some of which we're kind of implementing now. We've got a kind of a service charge revision that we're going to be undertaking. We think as rates decline and ECRs come down, that that puts more clients into a position where their earnings credit rate does not necessarily cover all of their consumption of internal services. And that could also kind of push that up. So, we think that, again, we're looking for growth in that category certainly kind of going forward and kind of expect to see that.\nMatthew Clark: Okay. And then just last one for me, on the interest-bearing deposits. Can you update us on the spot rate at the end of the year? And it seems like the pressure there is subsiding and kind of how you think about the beta on the way down on interest-bearing specifically?\nDale Gibbons: Yes. Interest-bearing deposit spot rate was 3.63% at year-end. In terms of the beta coming down, we think it's going to be very strong. We expect betas to be certainly no slower on the way down than they were on the way up. You may recall that our betas have been faster than industry norms, kind of, this entire time, and our clients are expecting that, that is that we're watching that closely, and so are they. So I expect that we're going to be able to pull down the interest-bearing costs. And for those that are ECR-related, pull those down as well on the imputed yields that some of them have, which might be tied to effective Fed funds.\nMatthew Clark: Got it. Okay, great. Thank you.\nDale Gibbons: Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris McGratty of KBW. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nChris McGratty: Great, good afternoon. Ken, maybe a question on the balance sheet and capital. You talked about not wanting to be in the 98th percentile or so in terms of growth perspective because you weren't getting paid for it. But you're going to be at 11% pretty soon. Can you open the door a little bit on comments about appetite for buyback maybe in the back half of the year?\nKen Vecchione: Yes. Right now, we have no plans to do a buyback. And 11% is a little more of a floor for us. I know we call it a target, but it's more of a floor. So we want to build above that. And then we'll have growth capital. And as we enter '25, well, we're going to have a lot of decisions to make. If we see a lot of internal growth in front of us, that's where I like to deploy the money. First, you got to tell me what the economic environment is and I'll tell you if we're going to do a buyback. But really, the buyback conversation has not been on the table in this company. And again, the 11% is a floor for us.\nChris McGratty: Okay. So nothing for \u201824, but perhaps you'll weigh the alternatives between accelerating the growth and using the capital. Is that a fair for 2025 conversation?\nKen Vecchione: We spend a lot of time talking about \u201825 year. I want to get through \u201824 and make everything we just told you. But for '24, I could definitely tell you, there's no buyback on the table.\nChris McGratty: Okay. Thank you. In terms of, Dale, in terms of the balance sheet. You mentioned the HQLA, Dale. How -- are you targeting a percent of your balance sheet in securities? How do we think of the odds this quarter? How do we think about just the absolute, kind of bridging the $8 billion, the $2 billion, how much will go to buying incremental bonds?\nDale Gibbons: Yes. So I mean you can impute this from kind of our guidance, whereby we're showing $1.5 billion, if you just did it ratably, of growth in deposits in excess of loans. And the preponderance of that is certainly going to go to HQLA. As we talked about earlier, the first half of the year, kind of getting over that hurdle that we think will be added by -- in the summer, is going to do that. So if you just did, that would be $3 billion more in terms of HQLA that would take us to there. And then at that point in time, maybe there is a more proportional growth rate between loans and deposits. But that's kind of the range of numbers we're talking about.\nChris McGratty: Okay, great,. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bernard von-Gizycki of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nBernard von-Gizycki: Hi, guys. Just a question on ECR pricing dynamics. I know you noted the ECR-related deposit costs are expected to decline with rates and volume. Just on rates, I believe you have some deposits that pay in Fed funds and others that are in the lower 2% range. So you get a 25 basis point cut with 100% beta, does that flow through all customers or just the higher cost ECR deposits? And then you need additional rate cuts to get to the lower 3s before cutting them? Or will ECR rates decline for all ECR deposits for balance relationship?\nDale Gibbons: The preponderance of our ECR price deposits are of the type that you initially talked about, i.e., those that are really tied to effective Fed funds. And we think the beta with those is going to be very near 100%. The second piece where rates are significantly lower, we probably have maybe a stutter step with the first rate increase. We're not necessarily going to be able to kind of fully kind of pass through. But after that, I think we can put them on a trajectory as well. But those betas will be significantly lower, maybe we can get to 50% on that piece of it. But the larger piece, I think it's going to be at or near 100%.\nBernard von-Gizycki: And if we think about the volumes between those two or the balances, are they much higher for the 3%, like the lower ones? So once we start getting the cuts, even though you have the 100% beta for the ones paying Fed funds, is it just a smaller balance? I'm not sure if you could size it or give a magnitude between the two.\nDale Gibbons: Yes. So between what you're going to see in terms of warehouse lending, some of the things that are settlement services, some of our HOA deposits, you're probably approximately two-third of the number is going to have an elevated beta.\nBernard von-Gizycki: Okay. And then if I could just ask one more. Just on your outlook guidance. Just as we think about net interest income, you have the up 5% and up 10%. Could you just give us the underlying assumptions just the difference between the two? Like what gets you to the 10%?\nKen Vecchione: The 10% on management income is a combination of really the loan growth as we move forward, that's what's going to move us in that direction. And the additional liquidity we're bringing in, and placing that into investments.\nDale Gibbons: Yes, what does the yield curve look like? I mean if the yield curve tends to be flat or it remains inverted, that's going to probably look a little bit better on some of these commercial loans. What does that mix look like? And how is competitive pricing changing for all those items? We don't have a lot of insight into what that might be, hence, the parameters around a number that might be more median.\nBernard von-Gizycki: Okay, got it. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Gerlinger of Citi. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nBen Gerlinger: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nDale Gibbons: Good morning.\nBen Gerlinger: Just had a question. It seems obviously a bit more technical in nature, but it seems like loan yields were down linked-quarter on almost every lending category. I was curious if you can just kind of touch base on maybe the nuance of why? Might be just a technicality, like I said.\nDale Gibbons: Yes. So I did talk about a little bit on what happened on the loans held for sale versus investment, whereby we did a transfer from held for sale to investments. It really was done in the last day or just before that, of the third quarter. So that will affect their dropped loan yields back to some degree. There's also kind of been some mix revisions in there going forward. We're still seeing pricing opportunity on the repricing elements. We talked about the $2.9 billion that on average we have are rolling or -- this year. And while the piece of that, that is fixed rate, that's probably in about 20% of that number, those have a more ratable increase. But even on the variable side, we're still looking at elevated spreads relative to when those loans were originated two or three years ago.\nBen Gerlinger: Got you. No, that's good. So the next question I had was the spreads you're seeing in the market today. Like it seems like a lot of the $100-plus billion bank are stepping back in certain categories. Are you seeing better spreads because there's less lenders available or less lending being done from the bigger banks? Or is it kind of more just calling your shots and you're not seeing too many different -- because I mean, you do bank solid clients, so they typically would have the best rate available because it's a competitive market. I'm just kind of thinking about the yields going forward and especially pricing in a couple of cuts in the back half of the year.\nKen Vecchione: Yes. It's almost market-by-market dependent. There are just things going on in different markets for us. If you're talking tech and innovation, spreads there really haven't moved, but a little more competitive because there's less deal flow because they're raising less cash there. If you're talking some very specific lot banking deals, spreads are strong and we were getting our pricing. And some of these banks are moving in and moving out. It's really hard to give one generic answer as to, well, are they all pulling back or not.\nBen Gerlinger: Got it. Okay. If I could just sneak one more in. It seems like you said 11% is a bit of the floor going forward in capital. You also referenced the credit rating. The moment we get a public announcement from a credit rating agency, is that a catalyst event for you guys? Or is it more just you get to the 11% is kind of what you guys agreed upon? And once you hit 11%, you kind of operate a bit more autonomously?\nKen Vecchione: Well, the 11% is, as I said, a floor for us. We have to engage or continue to engage with the rating agencies. That's usually a two-step process. They usually put you on outlook positive and then come back and make the change. As far as I know so far, we got a change in our outlook from Fitch, but I don't know if there's any other bank that had a change in their outlook. So my friends at the rating agencies may be a little slow to pull the trigger. But when we go in there, we want to go in there with great capital levels, a firm, steady, stable asset quality and very strong liquidity. And that's how we're positioning the company. In the meantime, our corporate trust group is still operating and bringing in good business. They could just bring in more business with the upgrade to an investment rating. So they're doing just fine. This would just accelerate their opportunities to bring in more business.\nBen Gerlinger: Got you. Okay. I appreciate it. You'd probably be at 12 by the time you get that announcement. But I appreciate the time, guys. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brody Preston of UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nBrody Preston: Yes, thanks. I just wanted to follow-up on the loan yields. I understand the move from the HFS to HFI. I was hoping, Dale, if you could provide what the spot rate was for the loan portfolio at the end of the quarter?\nDale Gibbons: Yes, 703.\nBrody Preston: Okay. Thank you very much. I also wanted to get a better sense for the BTFP. What was the rationale behind paying off the BTFP but not more borrowings. I think the last time in your 3Q 10-Q, I think the rate on the BTFP was 4.76 versus the average short-term borrowing rate of 5.74 this quarter. I just wanted to better understand the thought process there.\nDale Gibbons: We don't -- frankly, we just thought we didn't need to be borrowing from the Federal Reserve. And so we did that. I agree with you it's at a modest cost. It was going to mature anyway. This is something that we had acquired in March of last year, and it was a 12-month deal. So it was a couple of months early relative to what it would have been. We thought we just -- it was part of the 2023 situation and leave it behind in 2023.\nBrody Preston: Got it. Thank you. I wanted to clarify just on the ECR-related deposits. I think the slide says you have $17.8 billion of ECR deposits at quarter end. But you got about $14.5 billion of NIB. So is there another component of the ECR-related deposits that's technically still interest-bearing but also gets compensated through ECR?\nDale Gibbons: Yes, correct. So what will happen is, depending on what type of client it is, we could have a situation whereby the manager gets the ECR and the owner gets the interest income. So you don't really see that in mortgage warehouse because those are really non-interest-bearing deposits. But on an HOA, for example, it's a dual situation most commonly, whereby the aggregator get an earnings credit rate on the dollars that are owned by the HOA itself. That is not interest expense because they simply have no claim on that liability to us and the deposits of that enterprise. So that's why that doubled up.\nBrody Preston: Got it. And then the last question I had was just on the MSR loss. I just wanted to maybe understand the mechanics a little bit, Dale. Did you -- throughout the course of this past year, did you maybe put a higher mark on the MSR and the correspondent production? Capitalize it at a higher rate? And did that impact the gain on sale margin at all and then you'd have to take a loss on it when rates moved against you and you sold the MSRs this quarter? I just want to understand the moving parts there.\nDale Gibbons: No, I think -- no, no, I wouldn't say that. I mean, it was kind of the volatility around what happened. So we saw CPRs decline to the slowest that I think I've ever seen, and maybe somebody in the business has been around. But they were like 3% to 4% of constant prepayment rate, and that is exceptionally low. And then when rates picked up again, I mean, rates fell, CPRs jumped, and maybe it was a little bit of a catch-up from refis or whatever that had been delayed. And so as a result of that, we had a gain in our hedge that fell short of the loss in terms of the valuation. And the result was the value of those servicing rights fell by $100 million in the fourth quarter, and we were $14 million shy of what we picked up in terms of gain on the hedge. And that was because we had such a rapid velocity change between a very low CPR, maybe the lowest ever, to something that was more normalized.\nKen Vecchione: Brody, I'd remind you that, by the end of Q4, the 10-year treasury dropped 69 basis points, from 4.57 to 3.88, just punctuate Dale's point. And these -- the MSR balance, we have several outsized valuation firms that come in and look at that MSR and value it for us to make sure that we're within the appropriate range.\nBrody Preston: Got it. Understood. Thank you very much for taking my questions, guys.\nKen Vecchione: Welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Terrell of Stephens. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Terrell: Hey, good morning. Dale, if I could start just -- I hear your comments around the mortgage banking and kind of the potential upside there not being captured on the go-forward guide. Just to the extent the mortgage market does turn and we do end up seeing kind of upside on the fee income front over time, can you just remind us the incremental efficiency in that business? And maybe just to give us a better sense of how the expenses would fluctuate with the lift in fees?\nDale Gibbons: Yes. I mean so when they were a stand-alone enterprise, they were running at about 50%. And when we acquired them, we were in kind of the low 40s, and they came in, and that took us to kind of the mid-40s. I think that's basically intact today. So yes, so it's -- frankly, they're marginal rate of efficiencies, pretty close to the banks overall now that the bank has invested in elements of higher cost with technology and some of this risk management infrastructure and lower investment yields related to the building of the HQLA. So right now, our efficiency ratios are comparable at about 50%.\nAndrew Terrell: Okay. I appreciate it. And then just looking at the deposit cost expense line this quarter, if I compare the disclosed expense on deposit costs versus the average balance of ECR deposits. It looks like on a percentage basis, the cost ticked down a few basis points this quarter. Have you lowered rates anywhere on the product already? Or is that more of a function of mix this quarter?\nDale Gibbons: We haven't lowered rates. But what we have done is we have one-off clients and said, \"Look, your spread relative to, say, effective Fed funds has been x and we're going to make it X minus.\" And some of this is going to happen a little -- maybe perhaps a little bit later, if you're going to do something today, but we've given them options. If you want to take a rate cut now, will skip to maybe the first one you get. So we're pushing those down on a basically individually as we kind of go through this. So we are picking that up now. I think that's going to continue into January, February.\nAndrew Terrell: And did you see any attrition as a result of those conversations? Or is there any color there?\nDale Gibbons: There hasn't been any attrition. And I think that's an input point for us in terms of what is our pricing like relative to alternatives elsewhere. I think what it means is that the fever is broken on the rate cycle, certainly, and the opportunity to move into either other financial institutions or to move it to some kind of off-balance sheet thing that maybe is invested in treasury, all of those have fallen in terms of what the opportunity is and what they might be able to migrate to. And I think that has helped us in these negotiations. We do these one-off and, to some degree, sequentially, in case we run into a situation like that, where we're starting to see some attrition like, okay, that's an important point. And then we'll ease off in terms of how many we're doing or what we're asking for, for them to give up.\nAndrew Terrell: Okay, great. Really appreciate the time this morning.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Smith of Autonomous. David, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nDavid Smith: Thank you. I wanted to circle back to those normalized NIM comments earlier in the call. Are you saying that 3.5% should be a floor or more the middle range for NIM in a typical rate cycle?\nDale Gibbons: Well, that was kind of -- that was in the kind of an extended conversation of where might we head over time. And getting back to a number for handle, I don't see that. So I mean that's an extended expectation of maybe kind of where we might be. I do feel like we're approaching kind of an equilibrium level now. And so the 3.5% number is not that far from that. But I'm not -- that isn't our guidance in terms of kind of where we're headed in 2024. [Multiple Speakers]\nDavid Smith: Yes. So if there's nothing else on the NIM, talking about capital, you're going to keep doing a high-teens ROTCE, and with your loan growth guide, I think that only implies something like 4% or 5% RWA growth this year. So that just seems to imply a ton of excess capital being generated and you should reach 11% CET1 pretty soon. I know 11% is a floor, but is there a level where you think that it just starts to get excessive? And even regardless of a change in ratings, just starts to make sense to turn on the buyback? If you're still being measured with loan growth?\nDale Gibbons: Look, as we climb above 11%, I think it introduces optionality. You can build capital and then that could be part of an M&A transaction. There could be multiple things that one could be done with it. But again, it's just -- we're not there right now. And we're, again, cleaning up kind of the last few things that we want to change on our balance sheet. And by the summertime, I think we'll be there in terms of the profile we're looking for, for liquidity.\nDavid Smith: Got it. And lastly, on deposits. Can you share how much of the interest-bearing deposits are indexed to a rate as opposed to having some level of discretion at the bank in terms of pricing?\nDale Gibbons: Well, I mean -- so I mean, if you look at our interest-bearing deposit costs, you can see that that is not as large of a component relative to kind of some of the ECR elements we've been talking about. So there is some it is a little bit higher beta, but it is less significant than on the ECR piece.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Braziler of Wells Fargo. Tim has disconnected. At this time, we currently have no further questions. So I'll hand back to Ken Vecchione for any further remarks.\nKen Vecchione: Well, thank you very much for joining us today, and we look forward to talking to you about 2024 in a couple of months from now. Thanks again.\nOperator: Thank you for joining today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

I'm going to focus my comments today on our fourth quarter accomplishments and our 2024 strategic priorities before turning it over to Craig to cover our fourth quarter financial results and outlook for 2024. Let's start on Page 5. The fourth quarter capped off another exciting and successful year at First Citizens. We kicked off the year, 1 year into our successful merger with CIT and rang out the year combined with SVB, all as we celebrated our 125th year anniversary. I'm really proud of what we accomplished in 2023 and believe we have tremendous opportunity ahead of us. There is an undeniable sense of momentum at First Citizens and our ambition is to serve our clients in ways never imagined 125 years ago. And we're well positioned for the future, thanks to continued focus on our clients and customers and our solid financial results. We delivered another quarter of solid financial results, driven by a strong net interest margin and adjusted efficiency ratio of 48%. We're pleased that both our general and commercial bank segments grew loans by double-digit percentage points in 2023. Due to strong deposit growth during the year, we improved our liquidity position significantly and ended the year with a strong capital position marked by a CET1 ratio of 13.36%. We recently announced 2 major additions to our team, which will help us to continue to successfully navigate the ever-changing landscape for large financial institutions. First, David Leitch was appointed to the Board of Directors in January. David is a distinguished leader, executive and attorney and he brings extensive experience and valuable insight to our Board. He retired from Bank of America in 2022, where he served as Vice Chair from 2021, 2022, and its Global General Counsel from 2016 to 2021, and we're excited to have David join the Board. Second, we announced that Greg Smith will join our executive leadership team as the bank's Chief Information and Operations Officer. Greg joins our team from TD Bank Financial Group in Toronto, Canada, where he served as Head of Transformation and Corporate Operations. In this leadership role, he set the vision and built key capabilities to drive end-to-end transformational change. He was also responsible for managing corporate projects and technology platforms. In the CIOO role at First Citizens, he will be responsible for the strategic enablement of technology, operations, cyber and data functions across the enterprise. Greg's extensive background and depth of experience will make him well suited to take on these important responsibilities, and we're excited to have him on board. Moving to Page 6. We remain intently focused on our core strategies, and I'll highlight a few of them for 2024. First, we remain focused on our clients and customers. Our combinations with CIT and SVB introduced us to new strategic markets that allow us to deliver expanded products and solutions across our diversified lines of business. We continue to support SVB's innovation economy clients and are focused on capturing synergies with the commercial businesses we acquired from CIT. In the general bank, we have enhanced our deposit campaigns to continue to grow quality core deposits. As we noted last quarter, we continue to expand our wealth business across our geographic footprint and our expanding advisory and self-service options for our clients in that space. Developing our associates and adding talent to support growth remain important priorities. Our integration efforts are centered on ensuring that we retain our culture which emphasizes a relationship-based approach to banking, a client-centric customer -- client and customer-centric service delivery model, a long-term focus and strong risk management. Operational efficiency is very important to us. In addition to disciplined expense management, we are managing our balance sheet to optimize our liquidity and capital positions to support continued profitable growth. Core deposit growth will be a major priority as we continue to increase deposits as a percentage of our total funding mix. We also continue to make regulatory readiness, a top strategic priority. We have made meaningful progress on our efforts thus far, but acknowledge we need to continue to refine and mature our processes to support the change in the company's size and complexity. We will be intently focused on these efforts in 2024. Now let's look at Page 7. We continue to make good progress on SVB's integration. Our efforts there have been extremely important, helping us retain clients, stabilize deposit balances and develop strategic priorities for the combined organization. As we discussed on the last call, we developed an integration road map, and we expect the majority of those efforts to be completed in 2024. Our goal remains to support the acquired lines of business, maintain their unique capabilities, all while improving efficiency and risk management, positioning us for future growth. We acknowledge the headwinds in the innovation economy as well as the increased competition in the space. However, we remain encouraged by the strength and value the SVB franchise brings to its client base and its unwavering commitment to providing a relationship-focused service that is unmatched in the innovation ecosystem. To conclude, I am very pleased with our performance in 2023 and excited about growth opportunities as we enter 2024. Despite industry adversity in 2023, we were able to protect and grow customer relationships, stabilize deposits at SVB, grow core deposits and loans in our general and commercial bank segments and build upon our strong capital and liquidity positions. I'd like to thank all of our associates for making 2023 a successful and positioning the bank for a successful future. With that, I'll turn it over to Craig Nix. Craig?\nCraig Nix: Thank you, Frank, and thank you all of you for joining us today. I'm going to anchor my comments regarding our fourth quarter financial results to the takeaways outlined on Page 9. Pages 10 through 29 provide more detail supporting the results for your reference. Our return metrics remain solid and in line with our expectations. ROE and ROA adjusted for notable items from 13.53% and 1.28%, respectively. Compared to the third quarter, these metrics were impacted by an expected 3.9% sequential decline in net interest income driven by a reduction in accretion income and higher deposit costs. These impacts were partially offset by higher loan and investment portfolio yields, which benefited from maturity and replacement of lower-yielding assets during the quarter. These higher yields offset by higher deposit costs drove net interest income ex accretion to be essentially flat to the sequential quarter. NIM contracted by 21 basis points during the quarter to 3.86% driven primarily by the same factors affecting the decline in net interest income I just discussed. Ex accretion, NIM declined by 5 basis points to 3.46%. Adjusted noninterest income was down modestly by 3% sequentially and majority of the decrease related to a decline in the fair value of customer derivative positions as a result of lower interest rates. Additionally, as we previously guided, our rental business experienced a decline in net rental income due to higher maintenance expenses. As a reminder, given strong utilization rates and positive repricing trends, we made the strategic decision to pull forward regulatory requalification programs in order to increase the number of available cars for leasing in 2024. These updates position us well to continue to provide our customers with the equipment they need. While we expect some normalization to historically high utilization levels in 2024, we believe that our well-diversified fleet positions us well for the future. A bright spot in the quarter was an increase in capital market fees as our capital markets business had its highest figure on record as we were able to take advantage of market dislocation as many banks pull back. Adjusted noninterest expense was largely in line with expectations, increasing sequentially by less than 1%. We experienced expense growth during the quarter in consulting and project costs related to strategic investments we had delayed earlier in the year. As we noted on the third quarter call, consulting and project costs were lower in the second and third quarters as we assessed and reprioritized areas of focus heading into 2024. In addition, fourth quarter expenses reflected our expanded CRA commitment as part of our integration efforts to assist communities in Northern California and Eastern Massachusetts. These increases were almost completely offset by lower FDIC insurance and personnel expenses. We remain very cognizant of the importance of expense discipline as we head into 2024, given headwinds to net interest income facing us and many in the industry. Credit continues to normalize and traced with our expectations for the quarter with net charge-offs coming in at the lower end of our guidance range of 50 to 60 basis points. Net charge-offs were $177 million during the quarter, representing a ratio of 0.53% of average loans, basically flat compared to the third quarter. Losses were largely in the same portfolio where we experienced charge-offs in previous quarters. Within the commercial bank, net charge-offs were concentrated in the general office and small ticket equipment leasing portfolios. We also experienced an idiosyncratic loss in the energy portfolio this quarter that we believe is not indicative of broader terms in the portfolio. While we continue to see stress in our general office portfolio in the commercial bank due to continued inflationary pressure, elevated interest rates and market dislocation, we have limited exposure which totaled $1.2 billion or roughly 1% of loans at the end of the fourth quarter. As a reminder, this portfolio is concentrated in Class B repositioned bridge loans and is where we have seen deterioration in past dues, criticized assets and charge-offs. General office CRE continues to be carefully monitored, and we are carrying an ACL on these loans of 9.37% compared to 4.77% on the overall general office portfolio. Net charge-offs in the SVB segment remained elevated due to continued stress in the investor dependent portfolio, but did decline sequentially by $35 million. At quarter end, this portfolio totaled $4.3 billion or approximately 3% of total loans with the highest risk category, early-stage companies totaling $1.4 billion or just over 1% of total loans. The allowance for credit losses increased sequentially by 5 basis points to 1.31% due to some adverse credit migration in our commercial portfolio and higher specific reserves on loans individually reviewed. Under the current macroeconomic backdrop, we continually look for indicators of portfolio stress by reviewing delinquency trends and grading migration by industry and/or geography to identify areas of concern. While credit quality remains within our risk appetite, we anticipate elevated net charge-offs in the innovation, general office and equipment finance portfolios this year. We have taken proactive steps to help limit losses, and we feel that we are properly balancing our growth and underwriting strategy, emphasizing opportunities to build upon our expertise and provide an appropriate risk-adjusted return. Now moving to the balance sheet. Loans were up $100 million over the third quarter. The General and Commercial Bank segment grew loans by $1.3 billion and $716 million respectively, while the SVB segment experienced a decline of just under $2 billion. In the General Bank, growth was concentrated in small business and commercial loans in our branch network as we continue to grow our customer base and deepen relationships. We are focused on executing our strategy of growing our customer base and supporting existing clients where we have a relationship and a proven history. We believe this relationship banking approach will continue to serve us well. In the Commercial Bank, Growth was driven by strong production in our industry verticals and middle market banking. Within the industry verticals, growth was concentrated in TMT, health care and energy. Growth in our TMT vertical continues to be driven by strong demand for new data centers. Our energy vertical is benefiting from the power infrastructure and renewable energy markets. As for middle market, the team continued its expansion strategy in 2023, adding bankers in Boston, New York, Santa Monica, Atlanta and Dallas, contributing to increased loan production during the year. The reduction in SVB segment loans was driven primarily by a decline in global fund banking, but to a smaller extent we saw a reduction in our technology and health care banking business. Despite a slowdown in private equity and venture capital markets, we are encouraged by strengthening loan pipeline in Global Fund Banking, which expanded by approximately 40% [indiscernible] quarter as the team continues to support our existing clients as well as add new relationships. Global Fund Banking closed on $4.8 billion in new deals in the fourth quarter, a 129% increase over the third quarter. While utilization room is depressed due to the macroeconomic environment, we have the largest finance team in the market and total approved exposure on the loan book has stabilized and has started to ramp up as the team continues to execute. We remain the primary banking partner for the vast majority of our GFB clients, which positions us well to ramp up both loans and deposits quickly when the macroeconomic environment improves. The decline in technology and health care banking was driven by paydowns outpacing new fundings as the private market investment landscape continues to face headwinds resulting in a difficult exit environment, lower fundraising numbers and fewer deals. Deposits were down a modest 0.3% sequentially driven by a $1.5 billion decline in the SVB segment due to continued client cash burn and muted fundraising activity. Importantly though, investment inflows increased from the third quarter, while outflows from burn declined, which helped us beat our third quarter forecast of an approximate $5 billion decline. The branch network declined by $492 million due to expected seasonal outflows. These declines were partially offset by a $2 billion increase in direct bank deposits. While the direct bank channel is higher cost and now accounts for 26% of our deposit base, it is an additional lever we continue to use to remain resilient through a turbulent environment and is a strong source of insured consumer deposits supporting our liquidity base. It also enabled us to pay down higher-cost FHLB debt earlier in the year and most recently redeemed some of our smaller subordinated debt issuances given excess capital and liquidity positions. Moving to capital. We continue to maintain a position of strength as our CET1 ratio increased by 11 basis points sequentially and ended the quarter at 13.36%, which remains well above our internal target range of 9% to 10%. The impact from our loss share agreement continues to provide for higher capital levels and contributed approximately 120 basis points to our CET1 ratio this quarter, down from 140 basis points last quarter. Even without this benefit to our ratios, we remain well above our target capital ranges and anticipate operating at an elevated level in the near term. We are currently in our annual capital planning process which includes reassessment of our goals and targets for consideration of both SVB and future regulatory changes. This process includes a full stress test, including the acquired SVB portfolio. Additionally, we continue to monitor the proposed Basel III rules but remained well positioned for any changes, including the inclusion of AOCI marks. Our CET1 ratio at the end of the fourth quarter was estimated at 11.8% when these AOCI marks are included and the impact from the loss share agreement is removed. We have confidence in the rate that we are accreting capital and our absolute capital levels relative to our internal targets, our capacity to handle balance sheet growth, our SVB integration efforts and our positioning with respect to the Basel III end game. Therefore, we do anticipate that our 2024 capital plan will include a share repurchase plan, which once approved, will commence in the second half of this year. We also anticipate beginning a programmatic issuance of long-term debt in 2024 to ensure compliance with the proposed long-term debt requirements by the expected phase-in deadlines. We expect our binding and strain to be risk-weighted assets for long-term debt and estimate our long-term debt shortfall to be approximately $8 billion to $11 billion. While this strategy is partly dictated by regulatory requirements, we anticipate these funding actions along with our deposit growth strategies will support the replacement of some portion of the FDIC purchase money note, which matures in March of 2028. I will close today on Page 31 by discussing our first quarter and full year outlook for 2024. We anticipate that loans will remain flat to modestly increase in the first quarter, driven by low single-digit percentage Commercial Banking segment due to continued strong performance in our industry verticals. We anticipate SVB loan balances to remain flat in the mid-$50 billion range. As mentioned earlier, the Global Fund Banking business is benefiting from a strong pipeline due to being back in the market for clients during the second half of 2023 following the pause prior and immediately after the acquisition. This growth, however, will continue to be pressured by headwinds in the private equity and venture capital markets. We also anticipate a modest decline in the technology and health care banking business as lower levels of new fundings and line draws coupled with increased loan payoffs result in loan portfolio contraction. Looking at the full year, we expect loans to end in the $139 billion to $143 billion range or mid-single-digit percentage growth. We foresee increased volumes in our Global Fund Banking business as a result of increased outreach beginning in the second quarter of '23 and our increased pipeline. Additionally, we continue to see strong growth in our general and commercial bank segments. However, we do expect moderation to mid-single-digit percentage growth in these segments in 2023. Turning to deposits. We expect a low single-digit percentage point increase in the first quarter, primarily due to growth in the branch network driven by leveraging new products and initiatives to deepen client relationships that emphasize deposit growth as well as seasonal growth prior to April tax outflows. We are also focused on increasing our customer base by building deposits through proactive sales associate outreach, centralized marketing campaign and increased community connectivity. For the full year, we anticipate low to mid-single-digit percentage growth primarily related to growth in the general bank previously discussed and a mid-single-digit percentage growth in SVB deposits as market activity and the impacts of customer outreach begin to help produce deposit growth in the back half of 2024. With respect to SVB deposits, we expect the venture capital environment to remain challenging, particularly in the first half of 2024. Since April, we've seen SVB deposits remain largely stable despite continued cash burn exceeding funds sourced from fundraising activities. Encouragingly, we also added over 60 new primary operating business clients between April and November of 2023. We believe our emphasis on client engagement, coupled with better fundraising in the back half of 2024 will help propel modest growth in this segment. We'll continue to raise deposits in our direct bank. However, given the excess liquidity on our balance sheet, this pace will be moderated from the growth we experienced in 2023 with a growth rate of less than 10% anticipated in the channel. This obviously could change if we have unexpected deposit outflows elsewhere. Our interest rate forecast follows the implied forward curve, which includes 6 rate cuts in 2024, with the effective Fed funds rate declining from 5.5% to 4% by the end of the year. The implied curve currently diverges from the Fed dot plot expectations, which includes 3 rate cuts with effective Fed funds rate declining to 4.75%. It is our belief that we will see closer to 3 or 4 rate cuts given the continued strength in the labor market and the fact that inflation remains stubbornly above the Fed's target rate. Therefore, for our net interest income guidance, we provide a range with the top end assuming 3 rate cuts and the low end assuming 6 rate cuts. For the first quarter, we expect net interest income to be down in mid-single-digit percentage points range with and without accretion. The decline in headline net interest income will be driven by the impact of lower accretion and higher deposit costs, only partially offset by higher investment yields. For the full year, we expect net interest income in the range of $6.9 billion to $7.1 billion, with the low end assuming fixed rate cuts and the high end, assuming 3 rate cuts. In either case, we project accretion income close to $485 million for the year, which is a decline from $725 million in the last 3 quarters of '23 as loan discounts on some of the shorter portfolios have been fully recognized. Isolated net interest income for the second through fourth quarter period to take into effect the timing of the SVB merger with 6 rate cuts, we expect headline net interest income to be low double digits percentage points and ex accretion by high single-digit percentage point. With 3 rate cuts, we expect headline to be down high single-digit percentage points and ex accretion down low to mid-single-digit percentage points. We anticipate our full cycle data to be approximately 44%, which is materially in line with our previous estimate of 43%. Moving on to adjusted noninterest income. We expect the first quarter to be relatively in line with the fourth quarter in the $440 million to $460 million range. Looking at the full year and isolating for only the second through fourth quarters, we anticipate being flat as continued growth in net operating lease rental, wealth management and mortgage income are offset by a decline in client investment fees due to anticipated lower -- the anticipated lower interest rate environment. We expect full year noninterest income to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. As Frank mentioned in his comments, we are excited for the continued build-out of and momentum in our wealth platform and will look to fully convert the legacy silicon private businesses in 2024. Moving to expenses. We expect a modest increase from the fourth quarter due to seasonal increases in personnel expense from higher benefits and incentives and software costs due to continued build out of product capabilities that will help us be a premier partner in the innovation economy in areas such as cash management, FX and payments as well as continued investment in our wealth capabilities that will help us sell deeper into our new national reach. Furthermore, we will continue the modernization of our platforms in consumer, equipment finance and factoring to ensure we are well equipped to scale in the future. We also have a few regulatory projects we will be completing this year related to ISO payments and Dodd-Frank. In addition, as Frank alluded to earlier, we were focused on building out our capabilities in the large bank and regulatory spaces which will require some focused builds. As of this -- all of this will be partially offset by continued acquisition synergies. Looking at the full year and isolating for the second through fourth quarters, we anticipate noninterest expense to be flat to up low single digits percentage points which equates to an adjusted noninterest expense target for the year of between $4.6 billion and $4.7 billion. While we expect to achieve the lower 25% band of our cost saves goal by the end of 2024, these savings will be offset by continued capability build out for large bank expectations as well as costs related to the strategic priorities I just mentioned. Our adjusted efficiency ratio is expected to be in the low 50% range in 2024, up slightly from 49% for full year 2023. On credit, we anticipate net charge-offs to remain in the 50 to 60 basis points range in the first quarter, given continued pressure in the general office real estate, small ticket equipment leasing and innovation portfolios. For the year, we expect net charge-offs in the 45 to 55 basis points range as we expect some of the pressure in the investor dependent portfolio to soften in the back half of the year as well as some of the changes we made in underwriting small ticket leases in 2022 began to favorably impact the net charge-off ratio. For both the first quarter and full year of 2024, we expect our tax rate to be in the 27% to 28% range, which is exclusive of any discrete items. In closing, we have accomplished a lot in 2023, including the transformational acquisition of SVB, which brought significant scale to our business and new product offerings through our geographically diverse client base. While economic and geopolitical uncertainties remain, we believe the strength of our diversified businesses, our strong capital and liquidity positions and our hard-working and dedicated associates will help us continue to take care of our customers and clients and deliver meaningful returns to our shareholders. As we've proven during previous economic downturns, our business model is resilient and recession-ready in large part due to our disciplined through-the-cycle credit underwriting standards and robust risk management infrastructure. In 2024, we remain focused on allocating capital where we can drive deeper relationship business with the goal of continuing to deliver top-tier financial returns. I will now turn it over to the operator for instructions for the question-and-answer portion of the call.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos from JP Morgan.\nSteven Alexopoulos: I want to start on asset sensitivity and the net interest income guidance. So part of what makes you guys so asset sensitive, right, is the outsized cash position. How do you guys see cash balances trending through 2024? What's in the guidance? And if the Fed does start cutting rates, is that the time to start putting more cash to work? Or are you still more focused on SVB deposits and other issues?\nCraig Nix: Well, first of all, right now, cash is around 17% of earning assets. And ideally, over time, we'd like to see that migrate to 10% to 12% replaced with either loans or investments. So -- but at this point in time, where we are in the cycle, we believe we have time to get that down, especially given the purchase money note. I'll let Tom talk a little bit about the rate sensitivity and the cash balance and what we may be looking for doing to position ourselves going forward.\nTom Eklund: Yes, Steve. During the second half of last year, we put about $8 billion worth of migrated from cash to securities, and we expect that to continue into 2024. Really, what we're doing is we're taking a methodical approach, not trying to buy the curve on any one day, but sort of do it over time and we'll continue to do that. We also put on about $1 billion worth of fair value hedges where we moved some of our fixed rate borrowings to floating rates. And you can expect to see that sort of continue to mitigate that asset sensitivity over time.\nSteven Alexopoulos: Okay. Got it. But you're generally expecting cash balances to stay fairly elevated in terms of what's in the NII guidance, right? That's what you're saying.\nCraig Nix: Yes, I think that's true, although I think the percentage might drop some, but not into that 10% to 12% ban at the end of 2024.\nSteven Alexopoulos: Okay. And then my follow-up question, I don't know Mark's on the line but in terms of the SVB business, last quarter, you guys talked about some green shoots, positive signs, right, new account openings. Curious, what do you see in the most recent quarter in terms of clients' prospects coming back to the bank and what's your assessment of the state of the market right now? I saw early-stage losses up a bit. Capital falls down, pipeline up. Just looks like the view on the current ecosystem at the moment.\nCraig Nix: Mark, do you want to take that?\nUnidentified Company Representative: Yes. Happy to jump in there. Steve, it's [Mark Cater]. And the fourth quarter was really, in this regard, a lot like the third quarter, continued momentum with new clients, new lending, winning back business that had departed to other financial institutions, et cetera. And so very encouraged by that as we look ahead to '24. At the same time, as I think Craig already mentioned, our target markets, the innovation economy continues to go through the reset, its own downturn. And as mentioned, we expect that's going to continue in '24. And so our intention is to keep doing what we were doing in '23. And hoping that '25 and ahead is better conditions, but again, feel good about the momentum we've got and going into '24, notwithstanding that we still have market headwinds.\nOperator: The next question today comes from the line of Brody Preston from UBS.\nBrody Preston: Craig, I just wanted to follow up on the cash comment. So if we're -- if you're using the forward curve, which has the Fed funds ending at 4% at the high end of the target range for 2024, so like [3.78] at the midpoint. Why not use the cash at the end of the year or sometime in the first quarter of '25, maybe to pay back that FDIC note. I mean, you'd just be earning like 35 to 40 basis points on it at that time. So it's pretty NIM dilutive. And I'm assuming that you all feel like you have a pretty decent handle on the SVB deposits now. Like is that contemplated in your thought process at all?\nCraig Nix: Yes, I'm going to let Tom amplify what I'm going to say here. But right now, where rates are, there's a positive arbitrage in there. And while it's dilutive to NIM, it's accretive to net interest income. Obviously, as we move into more rate cuts, it becomes less attractive to leave that purchase money note out there. And with the excess liquidity we have, we would have some optionality of pulling that down. Tom, would you like to amplify that?\nTom Eklund: I mean, I think the only comment I'd make is that, again, that excess liquidity and having that cash provides that option for us should raise all of the forecasted path and the forward rate curve. That's where it...\nBrody Preston: And then I did want to circle back. I think I heard you earlier, Craig, that you said you expected the SVB loans to remain around like in the $50 billion-ish kind of area for this year. I guess I wanted to ask like a little bit of a 2-part question here. What is kind of like the mix that you're assuming within that just because I saw that the cash flow dependent balances were up about $1 billion this quarter. And then two, like how do you think about the components of growth and what it does to the multiple? Because you kind of have these 2 divergent paths, right? If you can grow SVB that should naturally come with higher DDA balances, and that's really enhancing to your multiple over the long term versus kind of growing the higher-yielding commercial bank and maybe funding it more with your savings product is great for balance sheet growth, but I think investors would do that as less multiple enhancing? Like how do you think about those 2 paths?\nElliot Howard: Yes. Brody, this is Elliot Howard. I think on the SVB growth, we're expected to be up slightly from about mid-50s range this year, and a lot of that in the Global Fund Banking. Craig mentioned that our pipeline was up $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter from where it was, just really as a result of kind of being back in the market more fully in the second quarter. I think we're still seeing headwinds as Mark mentioned, second health care, just given the overall kind of environment. Longer term, I think we're bullish on the SVB growth, market activity returns, just with a similar of a client in the outreach to new clients. I think with that, certainly, with the loan growth, we'd expect more deposit growth to come as well as that returns, and that's a -- keep a rate on what we have certainly again our savings product and direct banks. The more that we can grow the SVB, we do think that will be setting better for the overall bank in earnings.\nBrody Preston: Got it. So just to confirm, though, for 2024, it does sound like we're leaning more into the commercial bank and maybe kind of funding that with higher cost savings deposits. Is that fair?\nCraig Nix: We're also projecting mid-single-digit growth in the general bank as well. So it's just pretty spread across the loan portfolios.\nOperator: The next question today comes from the line of Christopher Marinac from Janney Montgomery Scott.\nChristopher Marinac: Just wanted to ask more about the general criticized loan trends beyond what we saw in the DAC on office and the SVB portfolio?\nAndy Giangrave: Yes. Sure. This is Andy Giangrave. Obviously, it's -- the trends we're seeing are concentrated in general office and innovation. I think we have seen moderate migration in C&I, but nothing at this point of any concern.\nChristopher Marinac: Great. And then the charge-off guide being a little higher now in Q1 and then a little lower for the whole year, does that indicate to sort of kind of past clean up or clean up from past issues? Or do you see sort of, I guess, some greater shoots that, that credit can improve as this year goes on?\nAndy Giangrave: Yes. I think it's going to be the continued theme that we spoke about last quarter and this quarter. It's going to be concentrated in office innovation and our equipment finance. Obviously, there's the secular shift in office that's still a challenge, especially in this interest rate environment. The innovation, I think Mark highlighted well the challenges in the market. And then in the equipment finance side, it's really working through some of those older vintages, but we feel like the tightening of our underwriting in that portfolio and some of the increase in collection efforts should start to show some benefits in the back half of the year.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from the line of Brian Foran from Autonomous.\nBrian Foran: Maybe to follow up on credit and these 4 kind of main portfolios, the Class C office, the 2 investor-dependent and in the small ticket equipment finance. I think they total about $6.5 billion now, and you give us the reserves on most. But then I guess you also have pretty heavy charge-offs already and some purchase accounting marks. I don't know if it's easier to talk about them as a group or some of them separate. Is there any way to like frame between the allowance, the charge-offs to date and the purchase accounting. Like what is the cumulative loss you've now recognized on these portfolios.\nCraig Nix: Brian, this is Craig. I'll take those individually and in aggregate because I think it's important to really size that portfolio relative to the overall loan portfolio. If you take those 3 components, commercial, general office, equipment finance and the investor-dependent loans, whether the growth stages or early stage. Those totaled about $11.3 billion which is 8% of the loan portfolio. If you look at -- and now -- and so all those portfolios, we have total loss absorbing capacity of around 6.06% on net charge-offs for the year of around [$3.6 billion]. So if you aggregate those portfolios, our coverage is 1.9x, if we slice it down to the individual portfolios, commercial, general office, we have a coverage ratio of 1.1 and allow us 7.99% on charge-off price of $7.48. On the equipment finance, the allowance is 3.52% and charge-offs 1.87% to around 1.9% coverage. And then on investor dependent, we have an allowance of 5.21 and a purchase discount of 3.58 which totals the total loss of building capacity of 8.79. So the allowance covers the charge-offs of 4.66, but when including that purchase discount, which is available to absorb losses takes it to 1.9x. So we feel really good about both our projections there and about our coverage in terms of charge-offs both that we've incurred and that we expect to occur moving forward.\nBrian Foran: That's really helpful. I guess on the buyback, I'm assuming you're not going to answer the obvious question of sizing it for the second half of the year. But maybe can you just remind us, as we've moved through this year, there's been CET1. There's been CET1 ex the loss share. There's been the leverage. It seems like some of the divergent metrics are starting to converge. But when you look at kind of your excess capital position and what number are you focused on? Is it the roughly 12 pro forma CET1 versus the 9% to 10% target? With the different capital metrics, what's the focus right now as you move to midyear?\nCraig Nix: Yes. We look at it sort of -- I mean, if we do an asset test as of 12/31/23, with Basel III, it's around 12%. If we do an asset test with Basel III at [ex loss] share, it's around 11%. So that range of 11% to 12% sort of asset debt, that\u2019s at 12/31/23 leaves us well above our target ranges. And then obviously, as time goes on, we're accreting earnings at about 36 basis points a quarter and risk-weighted assets, we're taking at 27. So we look -- it's going to continue -- our capital position is going to continue to build. So we do think that share repurchases are going to -- we feel confident about share repurchases, not only rate accreting capital, but just the absolute levels of capital, our capacity to handle our balance sheet growth, SVB integration efforts and our positioning with respect to Basel III, all give us confidence in a very purposed plan. And you're right, I really can't speak to the size of that until we get through our internal stress testing, which is being conducted now as part of our capital plan. We do expect the timing subject to necessary internal and regulatory approvals to be in the second half of this year. So I hope that's helpful, but we are looking at definitely target that our capital ratios are well above our target ranges, looking at it in a myriad of different ways.\nOperator: The next question today is a follow-up question from Steven Alexopoulos from JP Morgan.\nSteven Alexopoulos: So the market is pretty happy with the news of buybacks coming back in the second half. My question is, so given the tangible book value growth, such a key focus for the senior team, at this valuation, I'm sure you'd love to be buying back the stock today. But at what valuation do buybacks become less attractive, right? I mean if the stock is trading, Mark delivers what we think at SVB, just saying it's 1.5% or something like that. This year, do you still buy back in the second half? Like where is like the line of the sand where you don't find buybacks as attractive?\nCraig Nix: Well, we look at it just like we would any other acquisitions. So there are a myriad of payback periods and tangible dilution payback periods that we look at. I'm not going to get into our modeling on it. But we certainly scrutinize repurchases just like we would scrutinize purchasing another bank in the open market. Tom, do you have anything else? Tom is responsible for some of the modeling we do there. But I think that's generally -- I don't think I left anything out there.\nTom Eklund: No, I think that's exactly right. I mean we bought back above tangible value in the past and it really has to do with sort of what our earnings trajectory looks like and sort of what other opportunities are out there. So yes, it varies, but it's not like there's a firm feeling.\nSteven Alexopoulos: Got it. Okay. Just one other one. On the NII guide, do you guys include the expected cost of this $8 billion to $11 billion debt issuance? Is that in there? Or if you issue, will that then impact the NII guide?\nCraig Nix: It's in there, but the issuance this year would be muted, so it won't have a significant impact on this year's NIM. But going forward, it will based on where our costs are today and what the costs are anticipated on that will probably be a headwind moving forward.\nOperator: The next question today is a follow-up question from Brody Preston from UBS.\nBrody Preston: I just had a couple of clarifying questions that I wanted to ask. The first one was just on the innovation C&I and cash flow dependent portfolio. As I said earlier, that was up $1 billion in balances. Was there any like movement from like the growth stage portfolio there? Was that kind of like true growth within that portfolio? And if so, do you happen to kind of have a read on what the industry verticals were that drove that growth?\nCraig Nix: Mark, do you have any insights on that? I don't have that right in front of me here.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Yes. So for the SVB portion of the portfolio, the cash flow dependent growth would have been largely centered in sponsor finance and our project finance portfolios and where we've continued in sponsor to have some elevated criticized but on the new loan production. And generally speaking, these are loans that fund pretty close to inception. We're seeing really nice opportunities there, notwithstanding the broader backdrop. Hope that's helpful.\nBrody Preston: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And Craig, do you have what the unfunded commitment balances for the bank were at 12/31?\nCraig Nix: Not on hand. We'll take that offline.\nDeanna Hart: Yes. Brody, I can follow up with you. This is Deanna, on those numbers.\nBrody Preston: Okay. Great. And Deanna, just last one, I got you. That 198 loan accretion number, does that include any PAA that's related to the unfunded commitment book?\nDeanna Hart: Yes. It would be inclusive of both the on balance sheet and off balance sheet.\nOperator: I'm not showing any further questions at this time. So I'd like to turn the call back over to our host, Deanna Hart for any closing remarks.\nDeanna Hart: Thank you, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. We appreciate your ongoing interest in our company. And if you have any further questions or need additional information, please feel free to reach out to our Investor Relations team. We hope you have a great rest of your day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor. For more information see our T&C."

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Stuart Lubow, President and CEO. Please go ahead.\nStuart Lubow: Good morning. Thank you, Shannon. With me today is Avi Reddy, our CFO, and thank you all for joining us this morning for our fourth quarter earnings call. 2023 was an unprecedented year in many respects, with the Federal Reserve taking interest rates to a multi-decade high and three regional banks failing resulting in significant focus on liquidity and deposits. Throughout all of this uncertainty, Dime's business model remained resilient as demonstrated by year-over-year growth in deposits of over $275 million and loans is over $200 million. Importantly, in 2023, we put in place several cornerstone investments that will serve as growth engines for the franchise in the years ahead. First, we rapidly assembled a cross-functional internal team to attract productive deposit gathering bankers from Signature Bank. In the second quarter, we were able to onboard six groups, and at 12/31, their portfolio stands at approximately $350 million with approximately 50% being in DDA. To provide some background, after I joined Dime in 2017, we put in place the building blocks for our private and commercial bank deposit gathering operations. This existing operation provided us a solid foundation that helped us attract these new groups. We are proud of the fact that Dime was the only bank in Metro New York that was able to attract these talented bankers, a testament to our client-first business model and our state-of-the-art technology and treasury management systems. Today, our overall private and commercial bank deposit portfolio stands at approximately $1.5 billion, inclusive of the new groups hired in 2023. Over the course of the second half of the year, we made significant operational and technology-related enhancements in this business and truly believe we now have the best-in-class private client platform in the Metro New York area. As I have said, this segment will be the growth engine for Dime in the years ahead as we build our portfolio via acquisition of new clients and new groups. Moving to the asset side of the balance sheet. We added to our business loan origination capacity by building out a brand-new health care vertical in 2023. This follows on the heels of building out a middle market C&I lending operation in '22. Our health care team is actively in the market, and our pipeline in this new vertical is now over $100 million and growing with an average rate of 9%. The health care vertical will add diversity to our balance sheet with solid margins. Once again, we continue to spend a significant amount of time on our recruiting front and believe we have the potential to add more groups of talented bankers in the future. We do believe there will be more fallout from larger local institutions as well as an opportunity to bring over individual clients who seek locally managed relationship-based bank coupled with a strong technology and treasury management stack. In summary, as we look back on 2023, it was important for Dime to navigate the dynamic environment while playing strategic offense and take advantage of market opportunities. As we have just completed our year-end strategic planning process, I want to lay out our medium and long-term goals. We intend on creating a more diversified balance sheet by focusing on growth in our business loan portfolio, which includes C&I and owner-occupied CRE. While we have historically been very strong operators in the multifamily and investor CRE, our committed focus for the future is to remix this balance sheet such that business loans will have a greater weighting. Right now, business loans account for approximately 21% of loans, and we envision growing that -- growing business loans to 30% and reducing multi-foundry to the 25% to 30% range over a two-to-three year time frame. To provide you some context on how earnest we are about the balance sheet transformation, a look at our current loan pipeline indicates approximately $780 million in the pipeline with 70% in business loans. A year ago, business loans accounted for only 35% of the pipeline. By the way, the average rate on our pipeline is 8.43%. Building on the success we have had on the deposit gathering front, growing our private and commercial bank will be a key focus. This will allow us to continue to grow the DDA balances as well as lower our loan-to-deposit ratio to a range between 90% and 95% over medium term. As I've said, we are in discussions with numerous teams at the current time and expect to hire additional top quality bankers in the year ahead. Finally, I want to provide some thoughts on our profitability goals. While our asset book has limited maturities and re-pricings in '24, in 2025 and 2026, we see increased repricing on the asset side. Returning to a 110 to 125 ROA is a key market, and we are highly focused on getting there as the asset side of the balance sheet turns over. This will be accomplished by a significant improvement in NIM as rates normalize. In the interim, we will continue to control the things that we can, including staying extremely disciplined on expenses. As I said in our last earnings call, our main focus is on providing our customers with outstanding service that only a locally managed community bank can provide, growing our financialized value and delivering shareholders -- our shareholders strong returns. Being a conservative underwriter of credit has always been a hallmark of Dime. We continue to have a very low level of nonperforming loans, including past dues -- including no past dues in our $4 billion multifamily portfolio. With respect to the fourth quarter results, our core EPS was approximately $0.45. We were pleased to see NIM contraction continuing to slow, DDA balances remaining steady, capital ratios continuing to grow and asset quality metrics remaining stable. In closing, I would like to thank all our outstanding employees for staying focused on our goals during these challenging times. Avi will now provide more details on the quarter.\nAvinash Reddy: Thank you, Stu. Reported EPS was $0.37 per share. Excluding the impact of the special FDIC assessment and assuming a normalized tax rate of 27%, core EPS would have been approximately $0.45. The tax rate in the second half of the year was impacted by certain disallowed items related to executive severance. As mentioned in the press release, our expectation for the tax rate for 2024 is around 27%. As we expected, the pace of NIM compression slowed even further in the fourth quarter and the compression was only five basis points compared to 16 basis points in the prior quarter. At 29% of average total deposits, our noninterest-bearing deposit percentage remains a clear differentiator for Dime versus other community banks in our footprint. We are cognizant of the challenging revenue environment and continue to manage expenses prudently. Our focus is being as efficient as possible. Expenses for the fourth quarter, excluding the onetime FDIC special assessment and intangible amortization was $52.5 million. For the full year, cash noninterest expense, excluding FDIC special assessment, intangible amortization and severance was approximately $202 million, well below our annual guide for 2023 of $206 million to $209 million. Notably, we were able to absorb the cost of new hires into our organization by rationalizing expenses across the organization by using technology to automate manual processes and promoting and filling open roles from our talented employee base. Non-interest income for the third quarter was $8.5 million. We had a $3.7 million provision in the fourth quarter. The allowance to loans remain steady at 67 basis points. We're cognizant that there has been a lot of scrutiny on CRE concentration. In this regard, Dime's Investor CRE concentration, excluding multifamily loans, which are really residential loans for five or more tenants is only 258% of total capital. This quarter, our concentration levels dropped as we continue to focus on growing business loans and building capital. In light of the overall environment, our posture as it relates to the balance sheet is to build capital methodically. This will, in turn, support our clients when they need it. This quarter, our risk-based capital ratios increased by approximately 20 basis points. Now I will turn to some guidance for 2024. As you know, we don't provide quarterly quantitative NIM guidance. All else equal, we expect the NIM to remain within a few basis points of current levels until the Federal Reserve starts cutting rates. This is contingent on competition remaining rational and our loan originations, which help offset any deposit cost creep remaining at fourth quarter levels of approximately $200 million at 7.85. Once the Fed cuts rates, we anticipate expansion and our medium to longer-term goals and projections do envision the NIM getting back to historical levels in the low to mid-threes and potentially even higher. This will require more of our assets to -. And as mentioned earlier, 2025 and 2026 are significant years for us in terms of asset repricing. Of note, we have already begun to prepare for the Fed rate cuts by segmenting our deposit base into various buckets. It's important to note that our deposit base has less of a consumer weighting than national peer groups. And as such, we should see higher deposit betas on the way down. With respect to our positioning on lending, our strategy is to ensure we continue to support our key clients through any operating environment. And as Stu mentioned, we continue to see growth in our business loan portfolio. Growth in the business portfolio will offset declines in Multifamily and Investor Cree (NYSE:WOLF) where we are still servicing existing solid relationships. On an aggregate basis, we expect loan growth in 2024 to be in the low single digits with a stable first half of the year and growth in the latter half of the year. With respect to core cash noninterest expenses, if we take the Q4 cash operating expenses of $52.5 million and annualize that, we get to $210 million. We expect to be flat to up 1.5% on that base, which equates to $210 million to $213 million as a range for 2024. As I mentioned earlier, the expectation for the core tax rate for 2024 is around 27%. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator, and we will be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steve Moss with Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nStephen Moss: Good morning. Hey, Steve. Starting on the margin sensitivity here, Avi, just curious, how you -- I hear you in terms of Fed cuts getting into the low threes on the margin. How many rate cuts do you think it will take to get to that level?\nAvinash Reddy: Yes. Look, we're just following the forward curve, Steve, we don't give quantitative guidance. As I said, we're confident to get back into the low to mid-threes. I will say that if you follow the forward curve and you assume where the five-year treasury ends up and a positive sloping yield curve, with the 29% to 30% DDA and growing with some of the new groups that we've hired, we do see the potential to be even above what we were historically which was at the peak, we were around 330 on the NIM. But if you follow the forward curve in our internal model, we should end up above that. As Stu said, 2024, we don't have a lot of assets repricing, but that really starts picking up in 2025 and 2026. So I'll just leave it at there.\nStephen Moss: And could you just remind me how much do you have an assets repricing in 2025?\nAvinash Reddy: Yes, sure. So we have -- on the real estate side, we have around $575 million of assets in 2024. And then we probably have around $200 million to $225 million on the security side as well coming due.\nStephen Moss: Okay. And then a meaningful step-up in 2025 to -- from there?\nAvinash Reddy: Yes. For 2025, a meaningful step up, right? So in 2025, on the asset side, we have around $900 million in 2025. And then we have $250 million of securities that year. And then if you roll forward one year to 2026, we have around $1.4 billion in 2026 of assets and around $200 million of securities. Now that's contractual, right? But if the Fed cuts rates, you're going to see some of that -- some of those asset repricing from 2026 pull forward a 1.5 year in 2025.\nStephen Moss: Okay. Appreciate that. And the Stu, you mentioned the health care vertical. I'm sorry, but you cut out on just how large the pipeline was there. Wondering if you could just -- if you could give that number? And also, just curious, are you looking to hire any additional teams in the upcoming year?\nStuart Lubow: So at this point, the pipeline is approximately $115 million with a weighted average rate of 9%. And so we're very happy with the growth in the pipeline. We expect to have our first closings in the first quarter. So things are going well. In terms of additional teams, yes, I mean, we're looking at -- there are a couple of other C&I related and health care-related individuals and teams we're looking at that also have significant deposits as part of their book, and we are looking at them.\nStephen Moss: Okay. And does the expense guide contemplate additional hires for the year? Or would that be additive to expenses?\nAvinash Reddy: Yes. So I think, Steve, if you go back to last year, right, we gave guidance of $206 million to $209 million, and we hired six groups, and we beat the expense guidance by $6 million. So I think we're very cognizant of expenses. We will hire groups, and they're very profitable very quickly. I mean right now, it's with the groups and teams that we do have. But I would just say that the payback period on the group is very, very quick from a bottom line perspective.\nStuart Lubow: Yes. I mean last year, we brought on in ads groups we brought on 21 individuals, and we are able to cover those costs within our expense guide. I mean we're very cognizant of managing both sides of that, both the income opportunity, bringing on new teams on the expense side.\nStephen Moss: Okay. Great. I appreciate that. And one last question, just on the -- I assume it's one commercial real estate nonperforming loan. Any -- just curious any color you could give there on that credit?\nStuart Lubow: Yes. It's a fully tenanted building that houses two schools. Both tenants were paying. The borrower had some issues and did not remit payments to us. Since that time, five payments have been made, the loan is current and our policy is that we need six payments in order to put a loan -- take a loan out of nonaccrual. So we anticipate that loan coming -- actually coming out of nonaccrual this quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Fitzgibbon with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nMark Fitzgibbon: Hey, guys, good morning. Just to clarify, Avi, on the tax rate was elevated in both the third and fourth quarters. Could you just explain what the discrete items were, what they are and those will be fully out of the tax rate in the first quarter?\nAvinash Reddy: Yes. Mark, primarily, it's related to 162M issues with the CEO succession that we had. It's obviously a cumulative number, so it picks up. And then there were some other true-up items, return to provision type items. I mean if you look back historically, our tax rate has been in the 27% to 28% area obviously depends upon the level of income at the bank. So next year, 27% is a reasonable rate to use for next year.\nMark Fitzgibbon: Okay. Great. And then, Stu, your comments on hiring additional teams, are those presumably mostly from legacy Signature or other large banks? Or where do you see those teams coming from?\nStuart Lubow: Yes. I would say all of the above. So there's some serious opportunities both within existing teams at Signature and other institutions that we're in conversation with.\nMark Fitzgibbon: So of the teams that you've hired, those six teams that have brought in $300-and-some-odd million of deposits. What do you think those teams are capable of doing once they've -- their books have kind of fully matured and migrated over?\nAvinash Reddy: Yes, sure, Mark. So you go back to September 30, we were at $250 million on the teams at December 31, we were $333 million. Today, we're $375 million. So it seems like a steady build of $70 million to $80 million per quarter at this point. I mean the good thing is we look at it on a client level and an account level basis, and it's really not slowed down yet. So we expect to see continued growth in the quarters ahead over there. Again, they're very heavily focused on DDA. At this point, it does take time to move over clients. So I think so far, they're really meeting the expectations that we set out and they become profitable very quick. And really, the opportunity for us is to continue to grow that. But now that they've been here for a while, hiring new groups. And as Stu said, that's going to be additive as well pretty quickly overall.\nMark Fitzgibbon: Okay. The last question I had, Stu, is there's been a lot of dislocation in the banking space and your balance sheet has obviously held up well. Are you thinking about M&A at all? Is that sort of a priority, you think, for Dime over the next several quarters?\nStuart Lubow: Look, obviously, M&A has -- the talk about M&A has certainly picked up. There's still issues with marks and the balance sheets that are out there. I mean, certainly, for the right transaction, we're certainly interested. And would explore opportunities. So I do think, over time, and particularly in the next several years, there's going to be much more activity in the M&A space. And once the Fed kind of levels out and has a direction, I think there's going to be much more discussion out there. And certainly, given where we are in the marketplace and the strength of our balance sheet, I think there's certainly going to be an opportunity for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Manuel Navas with D.A. Davidson & Company. Your line is now open.\nManuel Navas: Hey, good morning. Just thinking about the overall deposit base. It's great that you're having success with the new hires and those teams are adding a lot. When would we see kind of an inflection for the rest? And what's driving the trends that caused some of the deposit outflows recently? Just kind of comment on deposit growth next year.\nAvinash Reddy: Yes. Look, I mean, Manuel, we grew deposits by $275 million in a year that was very challenging. I think, for the industry overall, if you look at the overall groups that we brought on, they brought on around $330 million, right? So on a net-net basis, we were flat in the rest of the bank. So I think if you look at that holistically, that's pretty reasonable in this environment. We've seen DDA really stabilize across the entire bank. And so I think when you start 2024, you're not -- whatever is left behind is really core DDA at the bank operational DDA. So that gives us a lot of comfort going forward with that. I think the opportunity here to grow deposits is really building our private and commercial bank as Stu said. We have $1.5 billion of deposits in that business. The branch business is important as well. And so I think as rates stabilize and normalize, we should be doing well over there. Obviously, over time, we've looked at our deposit base and conceptually where there are higher rate, chunkier deposits, we've kind of tried to normalize our deposit base over there like everybody else. All that's behind us in 2023. The important part is also looking at the loan-to-deposit ratio, right? I mean we're at 102 at the end of the year, we're actually closer to 100% right now. So we feel pretty comfortable from that perspective that we have the deposit growth to fund the loan growth that we're projecting for 2024.\nStuart Lubow: Yes. And most importantly, you see quarter-over-quarter DDA is stable. So I think there are not a lot of banks that can say that their DDA balances have remained stable over the last two quarters. And we see opportunities to continue to grow that base.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris O'Connell with KBW.\nChristopher O'Connell: So I think in your opening comments, you talked about the ROA getting up to 110 to 125 over time. Is that assuming that to get there, that's below 3s NIM that you're talking about as well longer term?\nAvinash Reddy: Yes, Chris, correct. Yes.\nChristopher O'Connell: Got it. And how are you guys thinking about, I know no quantitative guidance, but the pace of NIM expansion once the Fed starts cutting and if it's in a methodical or kind of gradual way, does that accelerate over time? Are you guys getting a full benefit in the first quarter of Fed cuts? You talked a little bit about kind of preparing your deposit book for this process. I know you won't give the quantitative guide, but just thinking about the pace of a magnitude as the Feds cutting would be helpful.\nAvinash Reddy: Yes. I think we plan to be very aggressive on the deposit side in terms of cutting rates. As I said, our book is weighted more to business and municipal customers. So that will allow us to be more aggressive on that front. That's on the liability side of the balance sheet, right? On the asset side of the balance sheet, as we mentioned, there's less repricings in 2024, and then that really starts to pick up in '25 and '26. So some of it will depend on the pace of which payoffs pick up on the asset side of the balance sheet. But I would say on the deposit side, if you split the two question up into how are you going to see deposit costs and what are you going to see on the asset side. I'd say on the deposit side, that's something we can control, and we expect to be very aggressive around that. On the asset side, it will just take a little bit of time given the structure and nature of our assets. I think throughout all of this, Chris, it's just really important to keep in mind, operating a bank with 30% DDA, right? It's just a matter of time before we get back to those margins over time, given the repricing opportunity that we have. The other piece that I just wanted to add is we have around $1 billion of borrowings that are at around $900 million to $950 million of borrowings that we've kept really short term, that's really going to reprice immediately as well. And we've intentionally kept that shot. We've been messaging that all across and really to position the balance sheet when rates drop. So we do have the benefit of that as well.\nStuart Lubow: Yes. And just anecdotally, if you look month over month, on November and December, we saw like two basis point increase in deposit rates each month. And in December, we saw an eight basis point increase in loan rates. So hence, we do feel that as Avi said, we're expecting relatively flat NIM within a few basis points until the Fed cuts.\nChristopher O'Connell: Great. That's helpful. And kind of along the same lines, I know it really hasn't been much of the margin for the past, I don't know, two years or so. But I mean when the Fed is kind of -- I mean, what do you think that a normalized kind of prepayment impact would have on the margin?\nAvinash Reddy: Yes. Look, it's going to be -- it has to be a whole lot better than what it is right now because right now, the prepayment fees on the margin is like one basis point or two basis points. I think if you go back to legacy Dime, we used to have between 10 and 15 basis points on prepayment fees. Now obviously, that's Multifamily is going to be a smaller piece of the overall portfolio. So I would say anywhere between five and 10 basis points when speeds really pick up, it's probably not a bad assumption. But I don't think that's going to happen in 2024 necessarily, just given...\nStuart Lubow: Yes, most likely, if it does, it's going to be towards late 2024.\nAvinash Reddy: Yes.\nStuart Lubow: Assuming the Fed rate cuts.\nAvinash Reddy: Yes.\nChristopher O'Connell: Great. And could you just provide a little bit of color on what the drivers of the net charge-offs were for this quarter?\nAvinash Reddy: Yes, sure. So we just fully charged it off a loan that we had previously fully reserved for. So last quarter, we took a $4 million charge. Stu mentioned that credit last quarter was still in the legal process on that loan, but we thought it was prudent to charge that fully off. It's something that we had put in nonaccrual status a couple of years back so nothing really new over there.\nChristopher O'Connell: Got it. And then I assume given the reserve ratio in some of the comments in the release that you guys did like we're reserving for a couple of other loans being individually analyzed. Just any comments around those?\nAvinash Reddy: Sure. So there was one net new addition to the C&I portfolio. It's a couple of million dollar loan, we fully reserved against it. However, they too have started paying at this point in time, and so there's a potential for that coming out.\nStuart Lubow: Yes. That was a C&I loan contractor loan that was -- had matured, and we couldn't come to terms on a renewal. And so we were very conservative in our approach. We made it -- so we fully reserve for that. Since then, we have -- they have agreed on basic terms of a renewal, brought through on current and we'll probably close that in the first quarter and put that back on accrual status.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Breese with Stephens.\nMatthew Breese: Just a couple of quick ones for me. Stu, just in light of your Multifamily guidance for getting to 25% to 30% of loans over the next two, three years. It feels like the pace have runoff, needs to accelerate to get there. And so I was curious if this quarter's kind of 2% quarterly reduction in Multifamily is a good run rate or a better representation of what we should be modeling in order to kind of achieve those goals?\nAvinash Reddy: Yes, Matt, I think for the near term, yes. So like we said, we have a limited amount of re-pricings and maturities in 2024, which is specifically why our guide is over the course of two to three years, we're going to get there. So it's -- if you go back a couple of years, our payoff speed on the Multi-family portfolio was 37%. Right now, it's 6%, right? So I think what the Q4 and Q3 numbers are reasonable estimates for the next six months or so. But then as the Fed starts cutting rates, you're going to start seeing a pickup in that. And then eventually, the loans do come up for maturity or repricing, which is again why this is a two-to-three-year goal for us.\nStuart Lubow: Yes. I mean we're looking at SATs and projected SATs each month. I mean for this month, we're probably going to have $40 million to $45 million in satisfactions and we're looking -- we're getting requests already for next month. So I mean there is some activity out there, some transactions happening. And so -- but it's very chunky. So it's hard to say it's exactly when you're going to see significant runoff. But suffice to say, we are seeing some amount of satisfactions each month.\nAvinash Reddy: Pipeline.\nMatthew Breese: I mean, can we just go back to one of the points you made there, I think you said historically, the payoff activity was 30% to 35% for Multifamily, making it effectively a 3-year duration type product...\nAvinash Reddy: Yes. No. No, Matt, the comment there was two years back at the peak, the payoff rate was 37%. If you look at it over a multi-decade horizon, you're probably between 15% and 20% is the true payoff rate on the multifamily side. Right now, it's 5% to 6%. So -- but as rates come down, they generally catch up. It's more of a timing issue, Matt. And again, we're pretty clear. We're trying to give two to three years worth of a forward look in terms of where we want and see the balance sheet ending up. The thing that we can control is what we feed into the bucket. And so right now, we really have no multifamily loans in the pipeline. So...\nStuart Lubow: For the first time, I think, ever, we don't have any pipeline in multifamily.\nMatthew Breese: Got it. Okay. Just one more question on this topic. As the typical kind of multifamily borrower reaches the end of their kind of standard five-year fixed, are they willfully rolling into the floating and waiting for lower rates? Are you seeing them reprice into higher rates or go elsewhere? What is kind of the common behavior?\nAvinash Reddy: Sure. So Matt, yes, we went back and looked at our 2018 vintage rate. So that's basically matured or repriced in 2023. So around 30% to 35% of that is satisfying at this point in time and it's around 65% that's taking the repricing option. So it's basically one-thirds, two-thirds in terms of the mix. Now we will say that there are competitors in the market right now that are in the low sixes to high fives, and as rates come down, you're going to see more of those loans not take the reprice. They're probably just kind of satisfy away from us given where the market is trending towards.\nStuart Lubow: Yes. I mean many of those viewed it as a short term, even though they're taking a rollover, they view it as a short-term rollover because they figure not -- why go through the expense of refinancing at these rates. But once rates do come down, they're going to -- they'll pull the trigger and prepay.\nMatthew Breese: Got it. I appreciate all that color. The last one for me is just conceptually, as the focus continues on business banking and moves away from traditional multifamily should we start to see the reserve reflect that and start to increase a little bit, 67 bps on today's balance sheet makes sense, but if multifamily is 25% alone, does it make sense for the reserve to be higher?\nAvinash Reddy: Matt, yes, absolutely.\nStuart Lubow: Yes. I mean our reserve methodology calls for at least 1% on C&I loans today. So as we put C&I loans on, we are significantly higher than what we're reserving for multifamily. And that -- so that transition will occur just naturally as part of our origination process.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And I'm currently showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the call back over to Stuart Lubow for closing remarks.\nStuart Lubow: Well, once again, I'd like to thank our dedicated employees who worked diligently through these challenges throughout the year and thank our shareholders for their continued support, and we look forward to seeing you next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor. For more information see our T&C."

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Raj.\nRaj Singh: Thank you, Susan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for the earnings call. About nine months ago, right after March Madness, at the first quarter earnings, we kind of laid out for you what our short-term strategic imperatives are. And they're roughly where, if we do the summarize them by let's say improve the balance sheet do then improve the P&L. And improve the balance sheet means, on the left side of the balance sheet, it relied less on resi and bonds and more C&I and CRE growth. The right side of the balance sheet rely more on core funding, defend DDA and if we did all that, margin would expand and of course, keep expenses in check and keep credit front and center given that we're in uncertain times. So, over the last couple of quarters, we kind of lay out for you how we did against those stated goals. I'm happy to announce the fourth quarter of 2023 was a continuation of that story. Deposits grew nicely, $426 million, despite the fact that includes a couple of $100 million of and brokered coming down. So, excluding brokered, our deposits grew $604 million. NIDDA was down for seasonal adjustment, literally happened in the last two, three days of the quarter. Average DDA were actually down only $28 million but period-end were down more. And on the wholesale funding came down as it did last quarter, FHLB, brokered everything was down. And on the left side of the balance sheet, just like last quarter, resi loans came down $172 million, bonds also came down $100 million, but we had growth in our core segments, C&I and CRE as well. I was actually -- at the beginning of the quarter, I was so seeing like it might be a flat quarter for CRE, but it also grew. So, total between C&I and CRE, we grew $476 million. On credit, by the way, all of this led to margin expansion again. So, margin expanded from 2.56% last quarter 2.60%. And if we keep doing this margin, we'll keep expanding, and we'll talk about next year in a little bit -- I think just go through the rest of the fourth quarter first. NPAs, on the credit side, NPAs ticked down from 40 basis points to 37 basis points. And if you exclude SBA loans, then 25 basis points. So NPA's are getting to a place where they're so low that it will be harder to drive them down, but charge-offs 9 basis points for the year. If we compare that to last year, I think we were at 22 basis points, if I remember right. So charge-offs for the full year have been fantastic. And we build reserve again a little bit this quarter -- I'm sorry, I still keep calling it reserve -- I mean ACL. So 82 basis points, it was 80 basis points last quarter. Criticized assets did increase this quarter, as you would expect, this time in the cycle. But overall, in credit, with charge-offs being where they are, NPAs being where they are and our reserve or ACL, being where it is, I'm sleeping very well at night. Capital is robust. CET1 is now 11.4% and TCE to TA also is now at 7%. Unrealized losses in the securities portfolio improved by over $100 million and AOCI net of tax improved by $50 million. So liquidity position stayed strong. So that's almost become a moving point at this juncture. So by the way, there are a couple of -- sort of notable items in the P&L which we highlighted in the earnings release, the FDIC assessment, which you guys all knew about, about $35 million. And also, we sold some railcars this quarter, and that was a $6.5 million charge. This actually helps us avoid some expenses in the coming quarters, which the $6.5 million is significantly less than the expenses that we avoid, if we had not sold these railcars. So some reprofiting expenses. So happy about that as well. So what are we seeing in the marketplace? The marketplace, there I'd say we're seeing a soft landing where we\u2018re seeing the perfect sort of thing, which we're all worried that the Fed will never be able to achieve, but it might be actually achieving that. On mainstream, we're not seeing a slowdown. We're not seeing a slowdown in either a loan demand or in margins. We're not seeing concerns in the credit beyond sort of the day-to-day concern that we always have. So we're seeing a pretty decent economy, especially in Florida, we're seeing a pretty strong economy and we need to feel more optimistic than even three months ago. With that in mind, I would say that for 2024 guidance, what we will say to you is, given what we see in the economy and the rate environment, it feels like this year, the strategy is going to stay the same, by the way. It's to improve the left side of the balance sheet, like I just described, we've been doing over the last couple of quarters, the last three quarters. And also improving the right side of the balance sheet. So we finished our planning for the year just a couple of weeks ago and what it comes out to is high single-digit growth in deposits, not including brokers, so brokers would actually want to take down, continue to take down FHLB. And on the lending side, again, on the C&I, CRE front, high single-digits growth. Resi will continue to shrink probably similar to the amount that it shrank this year, give or take, and NIDDA is where the focus will remain. And we'd like NIDDA to get back over 30%, probably. It's hard to say when that will happen, but we certainly are gearing the whole company up to shoot for that to get back over 30% over time. It may not happen in the year. It may happen in a couple of years. But that still will be the most important thing we'll be chasing. Margins should continue to improve. I mean the first quarter will probably be flattish, give or take 1 or 2 basis points. But after that, margin is a steady increase up into all of this year and into next year. And expenses will be mid-single digits in terms of expense growth. Am I missing anything? Or you can fill in if I miss anything else? And in terms of capital, at least this is the question that will come up to the very first question, I might as well answer it. For the time being, we stay on the sidelines and share repurchases at the February Board meeting, we'll talk about it again with the board. But I think in the short-term, that's going to be our stand. In the medium term, it will probably change but we need to see a little more time before we get back into capital repurchase. There is a dividend discussion that is coming up in February, and I do expect the Board to act positively of that. With that, let me turn it over to -- by the way, I'm recovering from a cold, so I tend to lose my vocal cords after a while. So if I speak less is not because I don't want to, I love speaking, but just a disclosure if I may have to stop. But Leslie, I'll turn it over to you. Tom first.\nThomas Cornish: Okay. Thanks, Raj. So first off -- I'll start a little bit on the deposit side. So as Raj mentioned, we were up $426 million for the quarter and non-brokered total deposits were grown by $604 million, excluding the non-brokered piece. The overall pipeline for deposits still continues to look very robust. Our near-term pipeline is about $1 billion, which is heavily dominated by operating account business and NIDDA business, in line with Raj's comments about continuing to emphasize that business. That pipeline has remained strong for a couple of quarters now. And I think it looks very good as we head into the first part of 2024. On the loan side, overall loans grew by $277 million for the quarter. As Raj outlined consistent with the strategy, Resi did decline by $172 million, CRE was up by $77 million for the quarter. We were happy with that growth. And the C&I growth across all segments, lines, geographies, specialties was up almost $400 million, $399 million for the quarter. So that was an excellent quarter for us in the C&I area. And mortgage warehouse was also actually up a bit for the quarter. We're starting to see some recovery in that sector as rates trended down, and we saw a bit more activity on the residential side. As Raj indicated, franchise equipment and municipal finance were down modestly, and those will probably continue to trend in that direction for 2024. We're optimistic about the growth of core C&I and CRE for the year. We are, I think, blessed to be in excellent markets and excellent individual geographies. I think we've got great talent, groups of people in the right places in the specialties in Florida, the Southeast, our office in Dallas now. In many parts of the company, we're just seeing very, very good growth opportunities on the C&I side. We have an extremely robust C&I pipeline in all areas of that corporate banking commercial and the small business unit, we're seeing just good quality opportunities across the franchise. We do think as we look towards the latter part of the year, we did have CRE growth for the year. I think we're pretty well positioned from a CRE perspective as we head into the year given that our overall numbers in the CRE portfolio are fairly modest at 23.6% of total risk-based capital -- of loan, I'm sorry, total loans and 13% of construction on total risk-based capital. So we've got plenty of opportunities in the future. The market now at rates where they are, is a bit muted, but also as we talk to clients looking towards the latter half of the year, we do see opportunities with clients that have capital at play. And I think compared to other banks that have much larger CRE and construction exposure issues, I think we'll be in a good position to selectively take advantage of some good quality opportunities as we get to the second half of the year if the rate market performs the way it's expected to perform. So with that, let me spend a few minutes on the CRE portfolio. You also have greater detail in Slides 12 through 14 of the supplemental deck, where we've provided additional disclosure. So the CRE portfolio does remain modest at 23.6% of total loans, CRE to total risk-based capital is 169%, well below the regulatory guidance threshold. At December 31, the weighted average LTV of the CRE portfolio was 56% and the weighted average debt service coverage ratio was 1.80%. About 16% of the CRE portfolio matures in the next 12 months and about 8% matures in the next 12 months in this fixed rate. Everybody's favorite topic is office. So let's talk a little bit about office. Specifically, we have just a little under $1.8 billion of office exposure. The majority of that is in Florida. Within that, a little over $300 million is medical office buildings. So that -- we think that asset class will perform differently. It is in a much stronger position than kind of office sort of nationwide. So our overall traditional office portfolio is around $1.5 billion. During the quarter, we had payoffs totaling $88 million in the office portfolio including what had been our largest office loan in the overall portfolio that went to the CMBS market at the end of the year. Our total office exposure was down $78 million for the quarter. It was also down in the third quarter by $30 million, so we're down to $108 million in the last two quarters of office exposure, which is significant as a percentage of the overall. Consistent with the prior quarter, the weighted average LTV of the office portfolio was 65%, weighted average debt service coverage ratio was 1.7% at December 31. We've provided some of the breakdown of those numbers by geography on Slide 12. Substantially all of the portfolio was performing and 92% was pass rated to December 31. Overall, the portfolio continues to perform well, is characterized by strong sponsors who are supporting underlying properties generally with low basis in the underlying properties, and we do not expect much in the way of loss content from the office portfolio. As I mentioned, 60% of the office portfolio is in Florida, where demand and demographics continue to be generally favorable, substantially all of the portfolio is suburban. There's some charts on Slide 14 that gives you some further geographic breakdown of Florida and the New York Tri-State portfolio is by the submarket. Just as a side story, I was in West Palm Beach last week, visiting a private equity client in their office building in downtown West Palm Beach, I pulled into the building and could not find a parking space and had to leave the building and go find public parking somewhere else. So I thought that was a pretty good indicator of the health of the office market in that particular geography that we're in. With respect to the New York Tri-State portfolio, 42% is in Manhattan, which totals approximately $180 million. Our Manhattan office portfolio has 96% occupancy in the 12-month lease rollover of 3%. The remainder is in Long Island and the boroughs and the surrounding tri-state area. Overall, rent rollover in the next 12 months is a small portion of the portfolio at 11%. $146 million of CRE office were rated below pass. The 12/31/23. This compares to $90 million at 09/30/23, an increase of $56 million. Most of this increase is a result of tenants vacating space in some buildings, which is putting pressure release temporarily on cash flows and increased insurance costs and interest rate cost to part of it. There is -- in most office buildings today, there is a phenomenon even if you re-lease the space, you have a concessionary period of time. In generally, unless it's a very short period of time, 90 days or less, we count that cash flow, even if we have an investment-grade tenant signed up to replace that. So we are seeing some of this turnover in the portfolio, and we'll work through parts of this. With that, I'll turn it over to Leslie for more details on the quarter.\nLeslie Lunak: Okay. Thanks, Tom. So net income from the quarter was $20.8 million or $0.27 per share, obviously, impacted by the FDIC special assessment that was $35.4 million pre-tax. We also sold or in some cases, entered into agreements to sell some railcars at EFG for a loss of $6.5 million. That compares to a gain of $4.2 million on similar transactions last quarter. So you see a pretty big $10 million swing in fee income quarter-over-quarter, but it's pretty much all related to those railcar sales. There may be some more of this over the next few quarters, but we don't expect it to net out to anything material in the aggregate in terms of gains and losses, although it could be lumpy. Net was 2.60% for the quarter compared to 2.56% last quarter. Earning asset yields went up from 5.52% to 5.70%. The yield on securities increased from 5.48% to 5.73%. There were some coupon resets in there. Some of these things only reset quarterly or annually. So we're still seeing coupon resets fill through, through the portfolio and some retrospective accounting adjustments. The yield on loans was up from 5.54% to 5.69%. Cost of deposits was up 22 basis points to 2.96%. I'll mention that, that 22 point -- 22 basis point increase this quarter compares to a 28 basis point increase last quarter. So for the last several quarters now, we've seen that rate of increase slow quarter-over-quarter, which is a good sign. Average cost of FHLB advances was pretty much flat, but the average balance was down almost $500 million, and that also contributed positively to the margin. A little bit more about 2024 guidance. Following up on what Raj said, we do expect the NIM to expand overall in 2024, although Q1 will likely be flattish down a little, maybe up a little. I do want to say, I know there's a lot of curiosity about this NIM expand -- the forecasted NIM expansion is a result of what we're doing on the balance sheet. It's a result of the transformation that we're doing on both the left side and the right side of the balance sheet, it actually doesn't tap much at all to do with whether there's two cuts, three cuts, six cuts, that's not going to change the picture. The static balance sheet is pretty neutral. It's very, very modestly asset-sensitive, but hopefully, the balance sheet isn't going to be static, and that's what's going to drive the NIM, it's balance sheet composition, not what the Fed does. Our forecast does have four cuts in it, one each quarter, but that's not really the driver. And we see NIM getting into the high 2s by the end of 2024. We're projecting a mid-single-digit increase in net interest income, along with the increase in the NIM, even though we expect the total balance sheet to remain relatively flat. Provision this quarter was $19 million, and the ACL-to-loan ratio increased from 80 to 82 basis points. The ratio of the ACL to nonperforming loans increased to 160% from 143% and the main drivers of this quarter's provision included commercial production and the remixing of the portfolio and some increase in criticized classified assets. There's a waterfall chart in the deck that shows you all the things that drove the change in the reserves for the quarter. I would say for 2024, we do expect the ACL to continue to build as a percentage of the portfolio composition shifts more towards commercial versus residential loans and the commercial loans, obviously generally carry higher reserves. The other thing I would make a point of saying is our pre-reserve is almost 3x our historical lifetime through-cycle loss rate. I get that, particularly with respect to office, we're looking in a little bit different world now than we have been historically, but that is a lot of cushion. Non-interest income and expense. We already talked about the FDIC special assessment in the railcar sale. The increase in comp compared to the prior quarter, we're very happy about because it's related to the impact of the increase in our stock price on the value of RSU and PSU award. So we don't wish that away. I don't think there's anything else of note to talk about the non-interest income and expense. The ETR was low this quarter mainly because of state RTP true-ups and the outsized impact they have on the ETR in the quarter where the pre-tax signings number is a little lower. Excluding any discrete items, I would expect the ETR for next year to be around 25.5%. And that's all I have. I'll turn it over to Raj for any closing remarks you want to make.\nRaj Singh: So listen, given where we're coming from over the last few months, this is a pretty good place. The progress that we've made, when I couple that with the momentum I'm seeing in the business, and the health of the economy, which we don't control, but we're certainly very grateful for and it impacts our bottom line. So when I look to 2024, I haven't felt as optimistic in quite some time. So it's a good place to start the year. I'll open this up for Q&A. Operator, we're ready for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Will Jones with KBW.\nWill Jones: I wanted to just start back on the margin guidance. That was really great color you gave just in terms of the margin really benefiting more of the balance sheet composition that go around as opposed to what rates do moving forward. But I guess the question is, the loan side is in process of changing. You guys have really done a lot of heavy lifting on the deposit side. Is the lift really coming from more one or the other? Or is the combination of both. [indiscernible]. Yes, go ahead.\nRaj Singh: Yes, I mean, we haven't -- we can't tell you mathematically like what part of it comes from what side of the other [indiscernible], I mean work needs to be done on both sides. And the comment that Leslie made about the Fed moves in our base numbers, we just use whatever the forward curve was, which was four cuts.\nLeslie Lunak: When we put [indiscernible].\nRaj Singh: Right. Exactly a month ago, when we put that our budget. But if it was two cuts or three cuts, four cuts or five cuts, it doesn't really matter. That's how the balance sheet is structured right now. Now if it's something really out of that feel of the day, they go down 10 cuts or something, something silly like could raise rates four or more times or that will be a different thing. But we didn't extra cut or 2 or less doesn't matter the guidance we're giving. It's -- it has more to do with our ability to keep doing what we've done in the last three quarters.\nLeslie Lunak: And I will say, well, the expansion that you've seen over the last couple of quarters has been more related to funding mix. But going forward, we're really starting to get some good traction on the C&I and CRE core growth. So I think it's both going forward. It's not more one than the other since [indiscernible].\nWill Jones: Yes, obviously I think those slides are important. But just in terms of the loan remix you guys are doing rolling off Resi and adding on C&I and CRE, where do you see that trade-off in yields on the portfolio as you kind of roll off some lower-yielding stuff and then add on some of the newer loans?\nLeslie Lunak: I mean today, well, the C&I increase that is coming on around 8, give or take, maybe a little more. And the Resi stuff that's rolling off -- I mean the Resi portfolio has an average yield in the mid-3s. So the big pickup. And we're also seeing, by the way, even still, and I don't know how long this will last, but at least for now, the spreads that we're putting on, on new commercial production are wider than the spreads on commercial loans that are rolling off, even if it's all floating rate product. Some of that is market conditions and some of that is that we're just doing a slightly different kind of business. We've moved away from some of the SNCs and things that we were doing and doing more bilateral relationship-based business, which also tends to come on at a little bit wider spreads.\nThomas Cornish: If you look, for example, at this year where we finished out, if you looked at every core lending group, corporate, commercial, small business and CRE, the internal spreads that we measure each group for the entire year finished with better spreads than they did in 2022. So we see incremental margin improvement in each of the lending teams.\nLeslie Lunak: So all of that is happening.\nRaj Singh: And that's what the pipeline looks like. At some point, maybe spreads will come back later, but we don't see that yet.\nWill Jones: Yes. Okay. That makes sense. And Raj, I'll ask because I feel like this is an important moment for you guys. It feels like there's quite a bit of optimism as to where the margin could go by the end of the year, it feels like this is really one of the first years where in a while that you guys are kind of maybe pulling back a little bit on expense growth. Is this the year where we start to see some operating leverage really play out, especially in the back half of 2024?\nRaj Singh: Yes. I know in terms of expenses and operating leverage, I'd rather achieve that through the revenue side than from the expense side. We have done a fairly large expense takeout exercise just before the pandemic. And I'll tell you that something you cannot do every couple of years. Otherwise, you won't really have much left. So you really have to invest. So we are continuing to invest in the markets -- core markets and the new markets that we have talked to you about over the last couple of years. And operating leverage should really come from expanding margins. And top line growth we'll come talk to you about growing total balance sheet as well. It may not be in the next two, three quarters because it's still a transforming balance sheet as a story. But Leslie is kicking into the table because I'm not supposed to talk about 2025. But if I was to take a wild guess, I would say that 2025 and beyond, I think we go back to the normal world of growing the balance sheet rather than just transforming it.\nWill Jones: Yes. Okay. That's great color. Last quick one for me. The gains and losses that you guys see selling the operating lease equipment, is that ordinary course of business for you guys? Or were those really kind of more one-time?\nLeslie Lunak: I think we're trying to pare down on asset classes we don't think are core to the future of our business. So you'll probably see some more of that over the course of the next several quarters. I wouldn't call it one-time, but it's not something we've done forever either. So you should expect to see some more of that. And although it will be lumpy, I don't expect it to be net-net material over the course of the next year.\nWill Jones: So it's odds equal, I mean, maybe that lease financing business, maybe it's not. We don't see much growth there for the foreseeable.\nLeslie Lunak: No, it should shrink.\nRaj Singh: It's been shrinking for the last three years. It will continue to shrink. The growth will come from our core footprint business, C&I, CRE, small business. Not from the, what we call BMT, which is the bridge finance business, which is franchise finance and equipment finance, both of those businesses, we have to be run down.\nThomas Cornish: Yes. If you went back 3 years ago, our UPB would have been $2 billion. Today, it's about $650 million.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Timur Braziler with Wells Fargo.\nTimur Braziler: Looking at deposit beta assumptions. I'm just wondering what your expectations are here over the next couple of quarters, assuming no rate cuts in the immediate near term, how much additional creep is there on deposit betas over kind of 1Q, 2Q? And then I'm just curious as to what your expectation is for deposit betas on the way down? And if the competitive Florida market might increase that lag effect on betas on the way down or if you think the Florida deposits are going to reprice similar to what you might see elsewhere.\nLeslie Lunak: So I'll address that at a high level. I mean there's a lot of very granular modeling that goes on there, and I'm not going to try to dive into all the details of it. The beta through the cycle thus far has been about 54. We're still modeling high 50s in the aggregate by the time repricing up stops. As far as on the way down, while I think we'll be quite proactive in bringing deposit cost down as rates come down, you have to remember that on the way up, the marginal cost -- when rates are coming down, the marginal cost of new business is going to be higher than the market at the total cost of the back book. So on the way up maybe not so much. The back book but on the way down, you are going to have the marginal cost of new business still being a little bit higher than the cost of the back book because the cost of the back book doesn't equal the marginal costs. So in the aggregate, when you look at it all together, because of that phenomenon, it will appear to be a little slower.\nRaj Singh: We do have one more quarter of CD reprice, significant CD repricing, which is the quarter we're in right now. So after that, when we look at our CD maturity, it just drops off pretty significantly after March. Last quarter, fourth quarter was pretty big and this quarter is also big. And then second quarter is really very small into the rest of the year. So that's one element of it. But I think the second element obviously is new money that is coming in compared to where the average book of the back book is today. New money is still coming in pretty high until the Fed cuts, but the existing book repricing should start basically -- that phenomenon should be over in about maybe eight more weeks.\nLeslie Lunak: Yes, agreed. And then we see this CD repricing phenomenon as one of the reasons we didn't guide to margin expansion in the first quarter.\nTimur Braziler: Got it. That makes sense. And then it's encouraging to hear that noninterest-bearing migration and 4Q was more so seasonal in nature. I'm wondering, do you think that the excess liquidity and the risk of kind of additional noninterest-bearing flight is done here? And if that's the case, can you maybe just talk us through what the seasonal factors are throughout the course of the year and how those balances should move along with that?\nRaj Singh: Yes. I mean our title business has grown very nicely. We're very happy with it. That's where most of that seasonality is coming from. It's basically more with origination, mortgage banking-related deposits. And they do -- they follow a pretty routine cycle. They're always weaker in the middle of the month, middle of the quarter. They're always stronger in month end and quarter end with one exception, which is year-end. Year-end that business kind of shuts down and there's very little activity. Nobody is closing a mortgage on December 31 or close to it. So we've looked back over the last three years very closely as this data and we see the same trend last December and the December before. It's just a little more pronounced as the business has gotten bigger. So that will start building up. Summer is when the business is the hottest and these things will level over time. But also within a month and within a quarter, we see that cyclicality and now we have a pretty good handle around it. So most of that happened in that business. There was a little bit of outflow from some accounts, but I would call that sort of ad hoc stuff like that happens. Sometimes they are in flow, sometimes in outflows. But I'd say 75% of that outflow really was a mortgage related, and it happened pretty late in this quarter. Which is why an average cost you see hardly any change, but period imbalances was a significant [indiscernible].\nLeslie Lunak: It's a regular December 31 phenomenon.\nTimur Braziler: Got it. And then just a couple CRE-related questions. It looks like office LTVs picked up a little bit quarter-over-quarter in New York. Maybe just talk us through some recent reappraisals that you've had in New York, primarily Manhattan and what you're seeing as far as LTV migration on the sales there?\nLeslie Lunak: I can say a couple of things about that. Some of that is reappraisal. Some of that is modeled because when we don't have a new appraisal, we -- our models actually take commercial property forecasts at the submarket detailed submarket level and adjust the LTV. So some of that is modeled and some of that is actually reappraisal. Tom, do you have anything to add?\nThomas Cornish: Yes. I would say our -- when you say New York City, everybody, obviously, specifically means Manhattan, the number of office loans we have in Manhattan is fairly -- it's a fairly small number. It's about 12 loans in total. The only maturities that we've seen actually paid off. So we were not looking at new appraisals. And I would say the information we hear kind of anecdotally, not related to our specific portfolio because we just don't have a large enough sample and did not have enough majorities to say that. I would say it's largely going to point towards valuations being down maybe 20%, something in that kind of range. But it's very much also a building by building issue depending upon the occupancy and debt service coverage and debt yields and things in that building. There's not like all real estate, it's building by building. But in general, those are the kinds of valuation changes we're hearing in the market. But given our fairly limited portfolio and lack of maturities, we don't have a whole base of information internally to go off.\nLeslie Lunak: And I will say, the LTVs remain very strong, a lot of cushion still there.\nTimur Braziler: Great. And then just lastly, New York City multifamily, what portion, if any, is rent regulated and what portion is 2019 or earlier vintage?\nLeslie Lunak: We have $121 million worth of New York City rent regulated exposure. It's insignificant at this point. So\u2026\nThomas Cornish: Yes, I'd also come back on the loan-to-value issue in New York. Loan-to-values are important, but also investor basis in the property is extremely important. And when you have -- our client base is a traditional generational owned client base. And when a lot of these buildings were acquired at extremely low valuations, the tax basis issue matters a lot in terms of how they support buildings, if there\u2019s any short-term swings in occupancy and debt service coverage ratios and things of that nature.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Rochester with Compass Point.\nDavid Rochester: Just a point of clarification on the expense guide. That's off of expenses ex the FDIC special? Or is it including that? Excluding it, right?\nLeslie Lunak: Yes. Thank you for making that point.\nDavid Rochester: Okay. Sure. I just want to make sure. And on the margin guide, that sounded great in terms of the high 2s. I was hoping you could maybe put some finer parameters around that because high 2s can be a pretty decent range, a pretty big range.\nLeslie Lunak: I know, and I'm a little bit hesitant to do that because there are just so many factors that could move that a few basis points in one direction or the other. So I'm a little hesitant to give you a point estimate because whatever point estimate I give you is going to be wrong.\nDavid Rochester: Got you. Whatever gets you to mid-singles on NII?\nLeslie Lunak: Yes.\nDavid Rochester: Yes. Okay. And just on the railcar sales, it sounded like you may have some more of those coming. Is the bulk of that book underwater at this point? If you just make a comment on that. And then what do all the sales mean for that income stream going forward? What's a good run rate on that going into the first quarter?\nLeslie Lunak: The income stream is going to come down, but the associated expenses are going to come down as well. And net-net, to bottom line, that's going to be a positive. I know you don't -- and the depreciation of operating lease equipment will come down as well and there are other expenses that you don't see because they're not broken out in the P&L of running that business that are going to come down. So while that fee income line will come down, net-net, this will be a boost to the bottom line.\nRaj Singh: Yes, I agree with that.\nDavid Rochester: Got you. In terms of the magnitude you guys are expecting there, I mean, should that get cut in half over the next year? Or how are you thinking about the trend down?\nLeslie Lunak: The fee income line, it will probably reach to $0.8 million and $0.9 million a quarter.\nDavid Rochester: Okay. And maybe one last one. I know you already addressed this on the buybacks. It seems like you're speaking positively about loan growth. C&I and CRE outlook is positive. You're talking about a soft landing, credit trends are contained. Why not take advantage of the discount to tangible here why you still have it?\nRaj Singh: Maybe I just speak too conservative. I kind of still feel there's more time that's needed to in the past. There's still a possibility of a recession or a slowdown. I think that's just -- I'd rather deploy that capital, honestly, into loan growth. I know we're not talking about total growth this year as much. But into next year, we are thinking about that. Even the bond portfolio, as an example, which we've been shrinking at some point this year, it will stop shrinking. So overall, we're also gearing for balance sheet growth in the out years and also looking at still uncertainty in the system. So put that all together in the very short term, I think we'll stay on the sideline. But I don't want to speak for the Board to mention the Board's decision but we do have this as a discussion point of every board meeting starting in February. We have that on the agenda again to discuss. My guess is they will probably defer it into probably the second half of the year. but we can change. We do actively discuss it every board meeting.\nThomas Cornish: I wanted to come back on one point on your railcar question as it related to the comment about underwater. It's not so much that we're underwater from a residual to NLV kind of analysis perspective, it's that these assets will require future investment to continue to keep them marketable and this is not a business line that we want to be in, in the long run. So when we have opportunities that we can continue to move out of these sometimes relatively small games, sometimes relatively small losses, it fits the long-term strategy of the company.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Arfstrom with RBC.\nJohn Arfstrom: I think Dave had all my questions just lined right up, but I do have a few more. How much more is it to do in the residential runoff? I mean, Raj, you alluded to it, it might be similar. So question one is, do we assume down another -- I guess, a little under $1 billion? And how long does this continue to go?\nRaj Singh: I think you should expect this year, $700 million, $800 million more this year. And we're not giving guidance for next year, but I think that trend is sort of -- will kind of continue because that -- I still think we're way over allocated to resi despite it being a very safe asset. It just doesn't have the yield on the spread. So yes, I think we did something -- I forget the exact number this year, but it will be a similar number about between '23. It will be a similar number in '24 in terms of production.\nJohn Arfstrom: Have you ever shared an optimal percentage for resi?\nRaj Singh: I'd say kind of what it used to be before the pandemic. So I think there's a way to go a couple of years to go before we does it.\nJohn Arfstrom: Okay. Okay. Good. You referenced the 30% is where you'd like noninterest-bearing to go. And I think the term you used was gearing up to get back there. How do you do that? What is the strategy to do that?\nUnidentified Company Representative: [indiscernible]\nRaj Singh: We were over 30% a couple of years back. Obviously, that was a very different monetary environment that we're in today. But at the beginning of the year, we often come up with sort of a slow business of the company to sort of rally behind. We wanted the company to rally behind. And I point with the idea of putting that up and saying that's what we're going to do. So this is not magic to the 30%. It's just that if we were at 32%, 33%, and I know certainly commercial length are even higher than that, we should strive for a three handle. So -- but there isn't a well thought out sort of logic to this of why you get there. What we will say is the pipeline that we now track closely than anything outside of the company with the treasury pipeline, account by account, which we spend hours every week focusing on is pretty decent [indiscernible] robust. And that gives me the confidence to say that I think that is attainable goal. It may not happen in the next two, three quarters, but it will certainly something which we can achieve in the next couple of years.\nThomas Cornish: I would add to that since I'm generally in the middle of the battle every day that it kind of comes down to three things. Number one, you have to have the right talent in the right places, so we are driving value at the client level and can make people change from ex-bank to our bank. You have to be focused on market segments that are predominantly more deposit-rich than others. There are some industries that drive significant deposits. And some that don't. So we have, over the last few years, altered our strategy to be very focused on the types of industries where you do tend to drive significant deposit levels. And the third is just back to something Raj alluded to is intense focus on it.\nRaj Singh: You do have to pick those spots based on where the money is and where the industry goes then go in and actually look at where the pain points are in those industries and those spots as you say. And it generally takes a multiyear effort to solve those pain points through combinational technology and process. And then you hit the market and you were able to gather on next share. That's been the formula for success. It doesn't happen in the year. A lot of these things take multiple years. But when they do work out, it's hard for people to replicate. And that's how this entire business has been built. And there are things in the pipeline that we're working on even now that we don't talk about openly because it's too early to talk about them. But they are about solving those pain points that bigger banks or even sometimes banks of our size are just not focused on, and we do.\nThomas Cornish: If you're a football fan, it's 4 yards in the cloud of dots every day.\nJohn Arfstrom: Yes. Okay. I thought it was 3 yards, but I'll give you 4, Tom.\nLeslie Lunak: [indiscernible].\nJohn Arfstrom: Yes. Okay, you're better than that. The dolphins they run -- they throw, they don't run is what I should say. Yes. Just one more. On Slide 6, it's interesting looking at 16 and 17, those two slides because obviously, the economic forecast had a huge impact on the reserves for the year, but you actually have a little better economic forecast. But I'm kind of circling that risk migration -- risk migration and specific reserves. Is that mix? Or is that true risk migration? Or what's behind that build? And then how material of a build do you expect for this going forward as the mix changes?\nLeslie Lunak: Yes. What you see there this quarter corresponds to the to the increase that you saw in criticized classified outlook that -- and one more that we put a specific reserve on it's not really material enough to go into details about. It's hard to say where that goes in the future, to be honest with you. I think credit is normalizing, NPL levels are very low. Net charge-off rates are very low, and I think across the industry, we're seeing some normalization of credit. And I think we'll continue to see that. There's nothing for us as we're not losing sleep over credit, but you will continue to see some normalization of credit. So there'll probably be a little bit of that.\nRaj. Singh: But it also includes the shift from resi [indiscernible].\nLeslie Lunak: [indiscernible].\nJohn Arfstrom: In general.\nRaj Singh: As the C&I build, CRE build and Resi goes up, you should expect the 82 basis points [indiscernible]\nLeslie Lunak: It will still go up.\nRaj Singh: Because we just -- against C&I, we have higher.\nLeslie Lunak: Yes, if nothing else happens, if everything else stays constant, in terms of the economy and specific reserves and risk rating and all of that, the reserve will still go up because of the compositional shift. That will be expected. I mean you can see right now we've got a 1.53% reserve on C&I and 0.09% reserve on residential. So.\nThomas Cornish: I say we have a very well disciplined and thought process around risk rating and we risk rate loans, what they are at this exact moment, not what we think they will be six months from now. And if you have a building that loses a tenant, and you have a new lease in place from an investment-grade company, but the cash flow does not start to kick in. For six months, we created based upon the cash flow today, not the cash flow six months from now. So that will change. We'll see some of that happen, but we risk rate, I think, very conservative and appropriately.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Gerlinger with Citi.\nBen Gerlinger: Just wanted to circle back. I know we've thrown out a lot of guidance and ranges. I just wanted to confirm I had everything correct. So kind of mid-single digits on NII expenses, mid-single-digit growth off of the core numbers, let's call it, just around $600 million, give or take on the full year '23. As I think you said lease finance should be around $9 million a quarter roughly.\nLeslie Lunak: [indiscernible]\nBen Gerlinger: Okay. So rough is it fair to call it around 20%, 21-ish on a normalized basis?\nLeslie Lunak: 20, 21, what, I'm sorry?\nBen Gerlinger: Million -- I'm sorry, for total non-interest income.\nLeslie Lunak: I don't know. I think you'll see a slight trend up in deposit service charges and fees on the back of NIDDA growth, they gave you the number for lease income. Probably the other will trend up a little bit, too. I don't have that number right in my head that total.\nBen Gerlinger: Sure. Okay, sounds good. I felt like I got most of the guidance right. So when you guys just think from the kind of lending and philosophical perspective. You said you guys are getting a little bit better rate, especially on even floating rate. Are you -- are you potentially introducing credit risk? Or is it just other lenders backing out that gives you a better yield? And if they come back in, the odd probably will start with raise, which is kind of annoying from a competitive perspective, but like is that embedded in some of your guidance that rates probably will come down if the economy is better than expected?\nRaj Singh: I think it has everything to do with the fact that the Fed is shrinking the amount of money in the system. So there is -- the cost of money has gone up, spreads are wider for that reason. By the way, they're wider on the deposit side too. So we're just kind of the conduit to pass that on to the borrowers. The same credit, same risk rating, same names something that is coming up for a little spread in this market that's 18 months ago. So it is not about that we're going down the credit spectrum, it is that the market is in a different place than it was competitively or for borrowing than a year ago. That's what is driving wider spreads. But like I said, we're also paying up on deposit side. That's why if it\u2019s only on the lending side that we're getting wider spreads in deposits was in the happy place like 1.5 years ago, my will be way wider. That's not the case. So now it's not about price selection. It's all about the market dynamics. There's less competition.\nBen Gerlinger: Got you. Okay. That's fair. And then when you think about kind of a holistic approach to expenses. I know there's some -- there's a cadence kind of with the seasonality of some are just more pronounced than others. I was just curious if you can just quarter-to-quarter, like where might the high point be? Or how should we think about the back half of the year?\nLeslie Lunak: We don\u2019t really try to provide quarter-by-quarter guidance. I don\u2019t know when certain things are going to hit the P&L. You typically have a little bit higher payroll expense in the first quarter, everybody does because of the front-loading of payroll taxes and 401(k) contributions and HAS seating and all of those things. But beyond that, we don\u2019t spend a lot of time trying to figure out which quarter expenses are going to hit the P&L.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos with J.P. Morgan.\nAlex Lau: This is Alex Lau on for Steve. Starting off with the margin, how much was the impact of CD repricing to the NIM in the fourth quarter? And what can we expect for the first quarter? Also, what were the rates of the old CDs running off and the new rates that CDs were coming on at?\nLeslie Lunak: I don't have all of those details in front of me for the fourth quarter. I know there's a little bit shy of $1 billion coming due in the first quarter that's probably going to reprice up on average by about 50 basis points.\nRaj Singh: In terms of new money coming in. And I don't recall exactly where the pricing is right now, but I do know that we backed off on the deposit pricing, on CD pricing, right around Thanksgiving. So we may have done it actually right after Thanksgiving and then once again in December. So we did get -- we did lower meaningfully what our promotional rates were for 12-month money, which is sort of our lead product. But I don't have the exact numbers internally. But I do remember making those decisions [indiscernible]. Yes, high 4s I think, is where we are.\nAlex Lau: Got it. Moving on to deposits. Which business segments or industry did you see the growth of the $600 million in non-brokered deposits in the quarter? And what level of rate are you paying on these new deposits? And how much of this is new DDA?\nThomas Cornish: Yes. I would say if you look at the deposit growth, it was pretty much across every business line. So it's across all segments. It would be -- I wouldn't have the detail in front of me to give you like a code-by-code breakdown of what industry segments it was, but it was pretty broadly based across kind of all lines of business, which is what we're seeing from what's in the pipeline when we look at it. I mean, it's hundreds of opportunities across all of our business units.\nAlex Lau: Great. And can you also comment on your ability to convert those treasury deposit pipelines in the fourth quarter? And has this ability to convert and improving with customers were willing to move balances now that March Madness close to a year ago now?\nThomas Cornish: Yes. I would say when we track the pipeline through various stages, I would say, our pull-through rates once we get to proposal rate are pretty high from my kind of historic viewpoint. I mean, normally, when we look at the pipeline, once we make a proposal, generally, our pull-through rate is probably in the 80% range. So obviously, before proposal, when something is in dialogue, then it's less. But once we get the proposal stage, our realization rate is pretty high.\nRaj Singh: By the way, somebody just texted me on our team, our 12-month CD price [indiscernible] is 4.5%, and we have a 9-month promo at 5%. That's been the rate for the last few weeks.\nAlex Lau: And then just one last question. What are your expectations for the efficiency ratio to trend in 2024? And when do you think that this ratio can get back to the historical, call it, low 50% range?\nLeslie Lunak: We're probably not that focused on the efficiency ratio, to be honest. We're more focused on expenses to assets and those types of things. I think our guidance is a mid-single digit increase in expenses and we don\u2019t spend a lot of time thinking about the efficiency ratio to be honest with you. Yes, not the efficiency ratio. There is certain components to that. The rate environment is going to affect that. The balance sheet transformation is going to affect that, and we\u2019d rather just focus on the components.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Zach Westerlind with UBS.\nZach Westerlind: It's Zack on for Brody. Most of my questions have been answered, so I just had a couple of quick ones related to the margin. The securities yield. You guys have had some nice increases in that over the next -- over the past three quarters. I was just curious what's driving that? And what's the trajectory looking like over the next couple of quarters?\nLeslie Lunak: I think what's been driving it is coupon rate increases for the most part. That's probably about done. So the trajectory is probably more likely down than us, particularly if we get rate cuts.\nZach Westerlind: Got it. And then on the deposit cost, the 420 spot rate, how do you expect that to trend over the first half of the year?\nLeslie Lunak: I think next quarter is going to be up because we're still -- we've got the CD repricing, and we still haven't had any rate cuts. If the forward curve comes to fruition, it will start trending down over at least the back half of the year or maybe as soon as the second quarter depending on what the Fed does.\nOperator: I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Raj for any closing remarks.\nRaj Singh: I'll close by saying, after a fairly typical 2023, we're starting the year 2024 at a very positive note. The business is -- it's got momentum in all the right places that we worked so hard on and the economy and the things that we don't control are also favoring us, especially in the markets that we're in. So all that gives me a lot of hope for what 2024 will be. There is still a lot of work for us to do and -- but the team is energized to hit the road and keep building through 2024. Thank you all for joining us. If you have any questions, of course, you can reach me or Leslie directly. We'll talk to you otherwise get in three months. Thank you. Bye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor. For more information see our T&C."

After that, we'll move to a Q&A session on the results with both Steve and Christophe. With that, let me turn it over to Steve.\nSteve Squeri: Good morning, and thanks for joining us. 2023 was another strong year for American Express. We delivered record revenues of $61 billion for the year, up 15% on an FX adjusted basis, and we had a record net income of over $8 billion, with earnings per share of $11.21. In the fourth quarter, we continued to drive strong customer engagement and demand for our premium products. We had solid growth in billings, strong new account acquisitions, and continued strength in credit quality, which remains the best in the industry. As a result, we achieved fourth quarter revenues of nearly $16 billion, which was another quarterly record, and EPS was $2.62. Christophe will provide detail on our quarterly results, but I would like to take a step back to talk about what we've accomplished over the last two years until you -- why I'm feeling good about where we are today and why I'm confident in our future. Coming out of the COVID pandemic in January of 2022, we saw an opportunity to accelerate our growth, and we set in aspiration to sustain growth over the longer term at levels that were higher than what we were achieving prior to the pandemic. At that time, we laid out our growth plan with the objective of positioning the company to be able to deliver on our aspiration of driving annual revenue growth of 10% plus and mid-teens EPS growth over the long-term. In executing the plan, we focused on listening to our customers and understanding their needs, and we invested in innovating our value propositions, as well as uplifting our marketing and technology capabilities and backing our colleagues to meet those needs. Looking back over the two years since we announced the growth plan, I'm pleased to say that we achieved what we set out to do and in fact, we're ahead of where we thought we'd be on our journey, thanks to the millions of premium customers we have around the world and the American Express colleagues, who support them. Today, we are a larger and stronger company. Since 2021, we've delivered record annual revenues, increasing the scale of our business by over 40% in just two years from $42 billion to $61 billion in annual revenues -- in revenues. Annual card spending over this period has increased 37% on an FX adjusted basis to a record $1.5 trillion. We've added about 25 million new proprietary card accounts over the last two years, and over 70% of these new accounts are coming into the franchise on fee-based products. With the growth and new accounts we've seen over the past few years, we now have a total of over 140 million cards running on our global network. Our focus on continuously innovating our value propositions to meet the needs of our customers is driving increased brand relevance across generations, including millennial and Gen Z consumers. These customers represent over 60% of the new consumer accounts we acquired globally in 2023, and 75% of new consumer Platinum and Gold accounts acquired in the U.S. came from this cohort. At the same time, retention continues to be very high and our credit metrics remain strong and best-in-class. These strong results reflect the success of our strategic investments we've made in our business along with the tremendous earnings power of our business model. Looking ahead, let me tell you why I feel really good about our future prospects. We have a business model that is delivering premium performance, and we have strong momentum, which is driven by four key features of our model that differentiate us from the competition and are difficult to replicate. First, our economic construct has a set of diversified revenue sources that include card fees, spending and best-in-class lending with our subscription-like card fees being a core and fast-growing component of our revenue mix. We have a singular focus on premium customers and superior innovative value propositions. Our premium customers are high-spending, loyal and drive our strong credit performance. We have a large and growing partnership ecosystem that expands our brand value to card members and merchant partners around the world, and we have a global brand and a servicing ethos that truly sets us apart. Our business model provides us with strong competitive advantages, and the way we've been able to leverage the model's unique elements and execute our strategy has strengthened those advantages, giving us the runway for continuing our momentum across generations, geographies, and both our consumer and small-business customers. The power of our business model combined with the global scale of our premium customer base, the dedication and focus of our talented colleagues, and the attractiveness of the many growth opportunities we see ahead are the key reasons why I'm confident in our ability to continue on our growth plan. And it's why going forward, we will remain focused on our long-term aspiration of delivering annual revenue growth of 10% plus and mid-teens EPS growth. We believe this aspiration is the right one and we aim to achieve it every year. However, we manage the company for the long-term, and we anticipate there'll be a range of potential outcomes in any given year due to a variety of factors such as external environment and actions we might take that we decide are best for the business. Looking at this year, the continued momentum we've seen in the business as we've executed our strategy gives us confidence in our guidance for 2024, which is in line with our long-term aspiration. For the year, we expect to deliver annual revenue growth between 9% and 11%, and full-year EPS of $12.65 to $13.15. In addition, we plan to increase our quarterly dividend on common shares outstanding to $0.70 a share, up from $0.60, beginning with the first quarter 2024 dividend declaration. This represents more than a 60% increase in the dividend from when we introduced our growth plan in January of 2022. As always, we will continue to run our business for long-term, and we'll do that by listening to our customers and meeting their needs through innovative, unique value propositions and exceptional service that reflects our brand built on trust and security, delivered and supported by a world-class colleague base. In keeping our focus on backing our customers and our colleagues, we are confident that we will continue to deliver strong growth on a sustainable basis over the long-term. Thank you. And let me now turn it over to Christophe.\nChristophe Le Caillec: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's good to be here to talk about our 2023 results, which reflect another strong year of performance and to lay out our expectations for 2024. I will discuss both our quarterly and full-year results this morning. Since this year end and since looking at our business on an annual basis, it's more in sync with how we run the company. Starting with our summary financials on slide two. Full-year revenues reached an all-time high of $60.5 billion, up 15% on an FX adjusted basis. Our fourth quarter revenues were $15.8 billion and grew 11% year-over-year. This revenue momentum drove reported full-year net income of $8.4 billion, and earnings per share of $11.21. For the quarter, we reported net income of $1.9 billion, and earnings per share of $2.62. Let's now go to a more detailed look at the drivers of these results, beginning with billed business on slide three. We reached record levels of spending for both the full-year and the fourth quarter in 2023. Total billed business grew 9% versus last year on an FX adjusted basis. In the fourth quarter, billed business grew 6% as we continue to see more stable growth rates after lapping the prior year impact of Omicron back in the first quarter. This 6% growth rate does reflect a bit of softening versus last quarter, but I would point out that the number of transactions from our card members continues to grow double-digits year-over-year, a good indicator of the engagement of our customer base. Our growth was driven by 5% growth in business services spending, and although slower than last quarter, continued strong growth in travel and entertainment spending up 9% for the quarter. Restaurant spending remains our largest T&E category and reached $100 billion for the full-year for the first time, while airline spending growth slowed in the quarter. There are a few other key points to take away as we then break down our spending trends across our businesses, starting with our largest segment on slide four. U.S. consumer grew billings at 7% this quarter. We continue to see growth across all generations and age cohorts with millennials and Gen Z customers again driving our highest billed business growth within this segment. Their spending was up 15% this quarter. Looking at commercial services on slide five, overall growth came in at 1% this quarter, consistent with last quarter's growth rate. Spending growth from our U.S. small and medium-sized enterprise customers remained modest given unique dynamics seen by small businesses over the past few years. Specifically, in 2022, we saw a large increase in organic spending as businesses restocked their inventories following supply-chain issues during the pandemic. This caused a significant grow over challenged spending from this segment in the industry in 2023. Importantly, we continued to see strong levels of demand for new accounts, high levels of retention, and strong credit performance on our small-business products. Looking ahead, this positions us well for the future, a spending growth rebalance. And lastly, on slide six, you see our highest growth again this quarter in International Card Services. We continue to see double-digit growth across all regions and customer types. Spending from international consumers and from international SME and large corporate customers, each grew 13% in the fourth quarter. Overall, while we're seeing a softer spend environment, we are pleased with the continued strong engagement and loyalty of our card members across the globe. As we think about 2024, we are assuming a spend environment similar to what we've seen in the past few quarters. Now moving on to loans and card member receivables on slide seven. We saw a year-over-year growth of 13%. We expect this growth, which has been elevated versus pre-pandemic levels to continue to moderate as we progress through the 2024, but to still grow modestly faster than billings. Turning next to credit and provision on slide eight through 10. First and most importantly, we continue to see strong and best-in-class credit metrics. We attribute this performance to the high credit quality of our customer base, our robust risk management practices, and our disciplined growth strategy. As we had expected, our write-off and delinquency rates did continue to tick up this quarter, as you see on slide right. Going forward, we expect to see this delinquency and write-off rates remains strong with modest increases in 2024. Turning now to the accounting of this credit performance on slide nine. The modest increase in our card member loans and receivables delinquency rate combined with the quarter-over-quarter growth loan balances resulted in a $400 million reserve build. This reserve build combined with net write-offs drove $1.4 billion of provision expense in the fourth quarter. As you see on slide 10, we ended the fourth quarter with $5.4 billion of reserves, representing 2.8% of our total loans and card member receivables and continuing to reflect the premium nature of our card member base. This reserve rate remains about 10 basis points below the level we had pre-pandemic or day-one CECL. We continue to expect the reserve rate to increase a bit as we move through 2024, similar to the modest increases we've seen over the past few quarters. Moving next to revenue on slide 11. Total revenues were up 11% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and up 15% for the full-year on an FX adjusted basis. Our largest revenue line, discount revenue grew 5% year-over-year in Q4, and 9% for the full-year, as you can see on slide 12. This growth is mostly driven by the spending trends we discussed earlier. Net card fee revenues were up 17% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and 20% for the full-year, as you can see on slide 13. As we expected, growth continued to moderate a bit this quarter from the high levels we saw earlier this year, reflecting our cycle of product refreshes. In 2024, we expect to exit the year with some further momentum compared to the current growth supported by continued product innovation and our focus on premium value propositions. We currently have plans to refresh around 40 products globally next year. In the quarter, we acquired 2.9 million new cards, and the spend revenue and credit profiles of our new cardmembers continue to look strong. Moving on to slide 14. You can see that net interest income was up 30% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis in Q4, and 33% for the full-year. This growth is driven by the increase in our revolving loan balances and also by continued net yield expansion versus last year. When you think about 2024, you should expect to see net interest income growth moderate as balance growth moderates, with some continued tailwind from our tenured customers continuing to rebuild balances. And I would remind you that for our business model, we would not expect to see a meaningful impact from the lower interest-rate environment next year. To sum up, revenues on slide 15, the power of our diversified model continues to drive strong revenue momentum. Looking forward into 2024, we expect to see revenue growth between 9% and 11%. Moving to expenses on slide 16. Overall, total expenses were up 5% in the fourth quarter and 10% on a full-year basis, both growing significantly lower than revenue. This expense growth reflects the strong growth we're seeing in our business, the investments we've made, as well as our continued focus on expense discipline. Starting at the top of the page with variable customer engagement expenses. These costs came in at 40% of total revenues for the fourth quarter and 41% for the full-year. I would note that this cost came in a bit lower than our expectations, reflecting some of the natural hedges in our model. As T&E spend growth slowed a bit in the quarter, we saw lower rewards cuts than we had expected. For example, a lower mix of redemptions for airline's tickets and fewer points earned on airline spend. In 2024, I would expect our variable customer engagement expenses to grow slightly higher than our revenue, as we continue to focus on our premium products and drive engagement from our card members. On the marketing line, we invested around $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter and $5.2 billion for the full-year. This is a bit below last year and our expectations to have marketing spend at around $5.5 billion. Marketing expense came in lower than we expected for the quarter, reflecting lower demand given the softer T&E environment. However, we saw demand increase as we moved through the quarter and we continue to plan for increased marketing spend in 2024. We are confident that with our sophisticated acquisition engine will do so in an efficient way. Moving to the bottom of slide 16 brings us to operating expenses, which were $4.2 billion in the fourth quarter and $14.9 billion for the full year 2023. This was above our original expectations, driven by a few notable items in the quarter. First, as part of the normal course of business, we set up a reserve to cover expenses as we continuously look to enhance the organization's effectiveness. We also set up a reserve for exposure to a specific merchant, and like many others, we were impacted by the devaluation of the Argentine peso, which increased our OpEx in Q4 by $115 million. Looking forward, we continue to see OpEx as a key source of leverage, and our focus on delivering low levels of growth as we have historically done. In 2024, we expect operating expenses to be fairly flat to this year's expense. We will of course continue to assess opportunities as we move through the year, and our flexible model will allow us to dial up or down investments as needed. Taking everything into account in 2024, we expect total expense to grow mid to high-level digits for the full-year, as we expect to drive continued leverage through our operating expenses. Turning next to capital on slide 17. We've returned $5.3 billion of capital to our shareholders in 2023, including $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter on the back of strong earnings generation. We ended the year with our CET1 ratio at 10.5%, within our target range of 10% to 11%. In Q1 2024, as Steve discussed, we expect to increase our dividend by over 15% to $0.70 per quarter, consistent with our approach of growing our dividend in line with earnings, and our 20 to 25 target payout ratio. We plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate, while supporting our balance sheet growth. We do not expect any material near-term changes to our capital management approach. That brings me to our long-term aspiration and 2024 guidance on slide 18. We continue to run our business with a focus on our aspiration of revenue growth in excess of 10%, and mid-teens EPS growth, and we believe that is the right aspiration. As Steve discussed for the full-year 2024, specifically, we are reducing our guidance of having revenue growth of 9% to 11%, and earnings per share of between $12.65 and $13.15. This guidance remains in line with our aspiration and also factors in a range of scenarios based on what we're seeing in our business today. We also recently announced an agreement to sell our Accertify business. Our guidance and the items related to 2024 that I just walked through, do not include the potential impact from this sale. We do expect to realize a sizable gain on the sale and to reinvest a substantial portion of the gain back into our business, as we've done with similar transactions in the past. We expect the deal to close in the second quarter and plan to provide more detail then. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kartik to open the call for your questions.\nKartik Ramachandran: Thank you, Christophe. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit themselves to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will now open up the line for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Don Fandetti of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nDon Fandetti: Hi, good morning. Did you say the '24 EPS guidance and rev guidance? I guess on January spend, some of your peers have noted a slowdown on weather. Can you comment on that, and then just maybe talk a little bit about billed business in '24 in terms of SME?\nChristophe Le Caillec: Yes. So we don't talk about monthly numbers so let alone about you know a few weeks into the month of January. So, I think best is to wait until the end of quarter, and we'll provide a lot more color and detail on the billing in January so far. As far as how we think about billed business in 2024, our planning assumption is that we should expect or we expecting billings to be consistent with what we've seen in the prior few quarters, you know, and we are ready to see in a society if there is some. But for now, that's the assumption we have baked in our plans and how we constructed this guidance. On the SME side, it's the same, assumption if you want. We are assuming either something similar to what we're seeing in Q3, Q4, and you know we are very focused on winning the recoveries with SMEs. As I've said in my remarks, these card members have been through a lot over the last two, three years, and we are focusing on providing the best experience, the best products. We are focusing on acquiring as many customers as we can and helping them grow their business. And we'll be ready when they're ready. Historically, this has been a volatile segment for us. You know, how dynamic these customer segments are and we play a critical role in that industry and we'll be ready when they're ready.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nRyan Nash: Hey, good morning, guys.\nSteve Squeri: Good morning.\nRyan Nash: Maybe to build on Don's question. Can you maybe just dig a little bit deeper on some of the drivers of revenue growth, so discount revenues, card fees, and Christophe, I know you said that NII should decelerate then. Are we assuming any sort of re-acceleration as we move through the year, particularly in areas like U.S. Consumer or SME? Thank you.\nChristophe Le Caillec: Yes. Hey, good morning, Ryan, and thank you for your question. So the building blocks of the revenue growth remain the same. At a fairly high-level, we expect billing and therefore discount revenue to grow at a pace similar to what we've seen in the recent quarters. We expect card fees -- so Q4 is at 17%, full-year at 20%, we expect card fees to be a key contributor to growth going forward -- to remain a key contributor to growth going forward, and actually to exit Q4 at a higher level than where we are right now. And I gave you the context in my remarks, very much supported by the constant strength in premium acquisition, their product refresh and renewals that we are committed to execute on, and very strong retention rates, which we have experienced for many years now. And when it comes to the last either component of our revenue pool, net interest income, you should expect that growth rate to moderate very much driven by the fact that -- and you've seen the trend, I'm sure, Ryan, there you know asset growth and their lending growth rate has been moderating over the past quarters and we expect that moderation to continue. The very strong growth was a function of tenured card members rebuilding balances post-COVID, and you know at some stage we're going to reach there -- a more normal rate there and that will naturally drive NII new to a more moderate level of growth. I'm going to also mention that we believe that the interest-rate dynamic in what the Fed will design doesn't play a big role here in terms of what's going to happen to NII. And when you put all of this together and you can -- you know, we run multiple scenarios what if billing is a bit stronger, what if you know NII is a bit weaker, and we land in the same range of 9% to 11%. So that's very much how we think about that the revenue guidance.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Mark DeVries of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMark DeVries: Yes. Thanks. I was hoping you could dig a little further into kind of where the loan growth is coming from, how much of it is from new customers or relatively recently added customers versus older and gaining share there, and also whether you're seeing any kind of difference in credit performance on kind of balances from newer customers versus older.\nChristophe Le Caillec: Okay. So let me take loan growth first. The dynamic on loan growth has not changed, and for several quarters now it's also our philosophy and how we run the company. About 70% of their loan growth comes from tenured card members, and what we call tenured card members is card members who've been with us more than 12 months. And that's very much how we think about acquisition. We acquire card members. We develop relationships with them. Then we offer them -- you know, we cross-sell products, we increase alliance, we nurture those relationships, and we do that because we understand them better, we understand their spend patterns and they understand our products better as well. And that's the driver. There either we don't do much balanced transfers, if any at all, and we don't have promotional offers -- much promotional offers also. So it's very much growing with our tenured card members. And it's part of our strategy to contain if you on the credit risk and to control it. And when it comes to the credit profile of the new card members, we haven't changed our credit underwriting models, right? We still -- and we haven't changed as well our marketing channels and products. Well, we still skew towards positive selection in terms of credit profile. That has not changed and I need to say that there prospects that we bring in and become recent card members have very good credit profile.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Bill Carcache of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nBill Carcache: Thank you for taking my question, and good morning. I wanted to follow up on your comments about customer engagement spending outpacing revenue growth. Can you speak broadly to your ability to continue to drive customer engagement with elevated investment spending, while at the same time offsetting that margin pressure with operating expense leverage in other parts of the business? And I guess, you know, do you anticipate positive operating leverage on an aggregate basis with revenue growth outpacing the sum of that customer engagement and operating expense combined?\nChristophe Le Caillec: Yes. There's a lot here. So let me first take you through customer engagement. The key things for us and you've heard us say this for years, right? We build premium products and we price for that value. You've heard say as well that over the last years, we -- the mix of the portfolio shifted more towards premium products. That premiumization of the portfolio is the key driver behind that ratio of variable customer engagement expenses to revenue to more platinum card members, we bring more variable customer engagement expenses you should expect to see. But at the same time, we have a lot of initiatives to actually optimize this. And we have a lot of innovation in that space. I'm going to share with you one that is driving a lot of efficiencies for us. We've recently introduced there pay with point option where you can actually go in the app or the website, select one specific transaction and pay with points. So we have that either constant innovation to try to delight the customers, make their life easier, and at the same time, create efficiencies in terms of the weighted average cost per point. And specifically in Q4, one of the driver of that efficiency or that variable cardmember engagement expense was the fact that we saw less point redemption with airline tickets, which is one of the most expensive cost per point that we have. That drove some efficiencies in that metric. We also saw as there are some softness in in some T&E categories, less point accelerators earned and that created as well some efficiencies there. The reason why I'm pointing that out is just to give you some example of some of the natural hedges that exist in our business model, where -- when you see a little bit of softness in the top line, that creates some savings as well in some expense lines. So you know, we guided there -- towards a little bit of an increase in terms of the variable cardmember engagement expenses, and we're going to keep monitoring that. But I feel good about that trend. And I think that, that margin is still very strong and able to generate very strong earnings. We've committed to containing OpEx, and as I've said, we expect 2024 offering up expenses to be you know about flat to where we are ending 2023. And marketing expenses will dial up or down based on opportunities that we see based on the efficiencies that we create as well. The model works really well, as you can see, and I'm comfortable that the model is strong. And we are stress-testing that model running multiple scenarios and it works well in terms of its ability to generate earnings over time. And I would say risk-adjusted earnings because that powerful model why do we pay on variable card member engagement expenses comes back with a multiple on the credit line. We attract positive select -- we generate positive select. We attract premium card members who have a very strong credit profile, and I like paying for that as opposed to trying to control the credit risk down the road.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Jeff Adelson of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJeff Adelson: Hi. Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. Chris and Steve, just wanted to dig into the softer T&E trends a little bit. You know, it looks like you're seeing some softness, particularly in airline spend, you're seeing some slower point redemptions for tickets there. Just maybe give us some insight into what you're hearing and seeing from your card members on that front, and then just maybe in the quarter book, can you help us understand what you're kind of embedding in your expectations for T&E from here? I think in the past, you've talked about how the booking trends have been a pretty good indicator of what's to come. Maybe any comment on what you're seeing there?\nChristophe Le Caillec: Yes. So T&E, sequentially the growth rate came down. I need to point out though that is still up 9% year-over-year, so it's a pretty strong growth rate. In terms of airline spend, and if you heard, I'm sure the various airline, they all made comments about the bid of a softer demand. And since many of those customers are using an American Express card to pay for the airline ticket, we saw a similar trend. This being said, booking remains very strong on our TLS segment. I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I know there were strong. So I don't -- we'll see whether it's the beginning of a trend or whether it's a data point. But we keep you know seeing a lot of strength and you know the partnership we have with Delta is working very, very well. Originations of new cards are very strong. And here card members decided to redeem a bit less in Q4 with airline tickets than they did in the past and we've seen in the -- that choppiness as well in the past. I don't worry. It's one data point. And for 2024, we haven't either communicated on exactly what assumptions we're making by category, but either, I'm not too worried. We have a card member base that loves traveling, and I'm sure they're going to keep traveling.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Rick Shane of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRick Shane: Thanks for taking my questions this morning. Look, you guys have alluded to the fact that the reserve rate is going to go up or drift up in 2024. I'm curious if what's driving that. Presumably, it's a mix-shift between loans and card member receivables, but I'm wondering if, at any level, you're also suggesting that the reserve rate on the loan portfolio is going to go up as a reflection of either -- some sort of shift there. Is it just a pure mix-shift as the loan portfolio grows faster than the card member receivables?\nChristophe Le Caillec: Yes. So thank you, Rick, for your question. This is very -- this is an important point, so I'm glad you're asking the question. The first thing I want to say is that, the absolute levels when you look at the delinquency rates or the write-off rates are very low in terms of our historical performance, and on the slide I put as well the pre-pandemic levels. The write-off rate is 2% in Q4. It was 2.2% pre-pandemic, right? So we're still below where we were pre-pandemic. So in absolute they\u2019re very low. Relative to our peers, , which I know you know well, they also very good. And I'm sure you noted that every competitor or peer reported their numbers and experienced the same tick, but at a higher magnitude. I would take up of 20 basis point is one of the lowest in the industry. So I feel good about where we are and I feel good about the trend. When it comes to the dynamic in the portfolio, the key driver behind this is that there's still some normalization going on here. We are moving from sub-1% write-off rate during the pandemic. As you all know on this call, this was not a sustainable level and these rates are normalizing and they are normalizing at a slow pace, and I like that, and the 2% is, again, a place where I feel comfortable from a credit standpoint. The other thing to expand a little bit and take a step back in terms of, you know, what kind of loan growth we are seeing. The biggest contributors in terms of loan balances are their pay overtime facility that we offered with our charged products and their co-brands cards. And so both those portfolio have very strong credit profile and better credit profile than what we call internally proprietary lending, which includes blue cash every day for instance. So if anything, the profile of the portfolio and the mix of the portfolio is shifting and evolving more towards product that have a strong credit profile and high velocity. This being said, that normalization is happening and that's what's creating that little tick-up. And as I said in my comments, we're not quite done with that normalization, there's still a bit more to come in our minds, but not a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Saul Martinez of HSBC. Please go ahead.\nSaul Martinez: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just ask on capital, is there any updated thoughts on how you're thinking about Basel end game? Obviously, your preliminary expectations of the proposal, at least, are that it would take you down to closer to 7%, but there is a lot of talk about that being softened, just how are you thinking about capital management, you obviously increase your dividend, but how are you thinking about buybacks going forward in light of the uncertainty?\nChristophe Le Caillec: Yes, so thank you for your question. So not a lot has changed on that front outside of the fact that we've been meeting with regulators, Steve met with regulators, I met with regulators as well. And what I can tell you is that they're listening, they're engaged, and I think they understand our comments. The ball is back in their camp now and they're incorporating all the comments they receive from the industry and I'm sure you've seen a lot of those comments as well. So they have a lot of work to do. Right now we're in waiting mode. And I think we're expecting the current estimate is we're expecting their -- or at least their next version of the rules by the end of 2024, we'll see. It took 10-years to get to their first draft, so we'll see when we get the next version. I'm not too concerned. I feel good about our starting point and our capital position. As you know, we generate about 30% return on equity, which means that we generate a ton of capital. And for now, we're not going to change our capital policy. The first thing we do is of course fund the balance sheet then we distribute dividends We feel very confident about the increase that we are planning to do this year. And the rest is going to go in share buyback so that we keep capital between 10% and 11% of our risk weighted asset. And that's what we've done for years, that's what we're going to keep doing. And we're going adapt to the Basel rule. You know we're running the company conservatively as well with a big buffer over the 7% rate that we have. And so nothing has changed much on that front, so more to come when we get the final rules.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Moshe Orenbuch of TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Thanks. And many of my questions have been asked and answered, but hoping to follow up on a comment that you have just made about the pay overtime business. Could you talk a little bit more about the characteristics of that? You mentioned that obviously, that's going to tenured charge card customers. So the quality is very strong. Just talk a little bit about the yield and how much you've seen in kind of growth from that product.\nChristophe Le Caillec: Yes. So your description is correct, Moshe. It's a facility that we attached to our charge card products where they can decide if they want to revolve proportion of their bill. This is the fastest growing category for us in terms of loan growth. It was very well received by the card members. And I don't know what else I can I can tell you. Remember that their charge card has a no preset limits, which is an important feature here. So it's a way for us to give them as well -- and it's a painful product so it's a way for us to give them a facility, where they can revolve over a period of time. And as I've said previously, their credit profile is very strong on this product, very much because it is attached to a very premium base, right? And Premium Gold card members are using this facility and revolving from time to time.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Please go ahead.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you. Maybe I could ask the questions regarding what's embedded in the revenue growth expectations for 2024 differently. If we look at the fourth quarter exit run rate, would that sort of target as to the low end of the guidance range? And then Christophe, you mentioned that lower rates shouldn't help, but aren't you guys liability-sensitive on the charge card portfolio? Thanks.\nChristophe Le Caillec: So let me take the second question first. We are slightly liability sensitive, and the key assumptions for us -- but the common remains that you know in its totality, our total balance sheet and total funding stack level, the impact of rate cuts is going to be very small to our NII. The big unknown here is what's going to happen to the beta. We've been as an industry trending around 0.7 on the way up. We probably got a trend to 0.7 on the way down, but not immediately, and it's hard to say exactly at this point in time where are we going to be when the Fed starts cutting rates. We are making assumptions with that we think are conservatives, but we don't know for sure and we'll see where we are. So there is a bit of uncertainty here, but what is -- what you know for sure is that you should not expect a big impact on NII depending on the rate curve. Going back to your first question around revenue, I just -- I don't have a lot to say on top of what I said earlier and what I've said in my prepared remarks. I'm happy to be surprised on the upside if billed business is stronger and card fees, we have good visibility. NII, I think the trend is very established. And on billing, as I said, we are assuming at this point in time something consistent with what we've seen in the previous quarters and we'll see where we are at the end of the year. But if the economy re-bounce, if the growth is a bit stronger than what is expected by economists and our card members are optimistic and keep spending, you know, I'd be delighted to have a higher billed business to report.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Dominick Gabriele of Oppenheimer & Co. Please go ahead.\nDominick Gabriele: Hey, good morning, Steve and Christophe. Thanks so much for taking my question. Thanks so much for taking my question. I was just curious about the total card growth. We all know that you've seen some really excellent account acquisitions over the last number of years so I was just curious about total card growth versus proprietary cards-in-force growth, in particular this quarter. If there is any color you can provide on why that may diverge or what the strategy is between maybe having more proprietary cards as a percentage of total cards? Anything on that would be excellent. Thanks so much.\nChristophe Le Caillec: Yes. So we have about 140 million cards that can transact on our network. Out of the 140 million cards, about 80 million are issued by American Express. That's what we call the proprietary cards. They represent the bulk of the spend and they drive the very vast majority of our economics. And from a growth rate standpoint, if you look at cards-in-force and it's -- you know, you'll see that in the details of our disclosures, the proprietary cards-in-force of 5% year-over-year, and the total cards-in-force, so including their cards issued by network partners is up 6%. Does it answer your question?\nDominick Gabriele: Very much. I really appreciate that. Have a good day.\nChristophe Le Caillec: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Arren Cyganovich of Citi. Please go ahead.\nArren Cyganovich: Thanks. And maybe I was wondering if you could talk about the plans for the next Platinum refresh in the US. I think the last one on 2021. And whether or not you have any plan to do that this year, and if that's your guidance for the year as well.\nSteve Squeri: Yes. So as you know, we have committed to refreshing 40 products this year, as Christophe has said, and strategically, we look at refreshing all of our products on a sort of three to four year basis. And it's important because it's really important to make sure that we keep our products fresh. We're listening to our customers and putting in those enhancements and the extra value that they want and enable us to make sure from a generational perspective, we are modifying those products as trends change and as our customer needs change. As far as specifically for the Platinum card, we don't really pre-announce that, and so I think you just have to wait and see.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Craig Maurer of FT Partners. Please go ahead.\nCraig Maurer: Yes. Good morning. Thanks. And two quick questions. Considering the strength of Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) over the last number of years, it's consistently the top airline. You've clearly, benefited a lot from that in terms of new card issuance and likely in spend as they've been able to hold fares better. As we see airlines spend slow, does that benefit diminish, and is it something you have to think about? And second, in terms of small business, no, we've been pretty flat now for a couple of quarters. Curious what you're seeing under the covers there is this. Are you still able to issue new cards, or -- and are you seeing any reluctance from small business to take additional products that might increase their cost beyond the baseline? I'm just trying to understand the move better small business owners. Thanks.\nSteve Squeri: Yes. So from a small business perspective, the drive is really organic spend. We're not seeing existing small businesses spend more than they spent the year before. And that's not an American Express phenomenon. That is an industry phenomenon. As far as card acquisition within small businesses, that still remains strong. As far as small businesses, looking at our platform and looking at our loans and so forth, that remains strong and the credit quality remains strong. I think as Christophe said in his remarks, there is this phenomenon of inventory buildup, some interest-rate shock and so forth, and so small businesses tend to be very, very secular. I would be much more concerned if we weren't acquiring cards, if we weren't engaging in new small businesses, or if write-offs and delinquencies were higher. So at the moment as we look at this, we truly believe this is an organic spending issue and it's not American Express-specific. I'll let Christophe talk a little bit about Delta.\nChristophe Le Caillec: Yes. So the Delta product is still going very, very strong. The total billing growth on the Delta product for the full year was up 15%, and we are originating a lot of new cards as well. And my comment about there either softness in terms of Q4, hard to say whether it's the beginning of a trend or whether it's just a blip, time will tell, but it's still growing very, very strong and the engagement with the partner is very strong -- the partnership is going strong. So I don't see any softness there at all. And I will say as well that their credit quality of those new card members remained very strong. I made comments about, it's one of the fastest-growing segment on the loan side and it comes with very strong performance. People who travel a lot and who fly a lot tend to have strong credit quality, and we see that on the loan side, on the spend side, on the origination side. So I'm not worried about that at this stage.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question will come from Mihir Bhatia of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMihir Bhatia: Hi. Thank you for squeezing me in here. I just wanted to go back a little bit and maybe just unpack the billings growth a little bit. Maybe can you just talk about how much of that is being driven by adding new card members versus winning wallet share? And then just related to that same topic was just how are you thinking about the environment for new card acquisition? Is this 3 million level that you have been out for the last couple of quarters, the right level to think about for the next year? I understand that is dynamic and you will change, but what have you assumed in your planning?\nChristophe Le Caillec: Yes. Let me talk about sort of card acquisition numbers. We go out and we look at acquiring card members who really focus on acquiring billed business and we acquire revenue. And consistently now, if you take the first quarter out of last year where it was a little bit more of an anomaly of 3.4 million cards, we've been around that 3 million to 2.9 million cards. And we will -- as long as we have line-of-sight into high credit quality premium cardmembers, we will continue to be out there aggressively acquiring cardmembers, and that range will be where we see that range today, between 2.9 million, 3.1 million. And we don't really provide any guidance on that, but with the amount of money we're planning on spending, I think that's a -- it's a pretty fair assumption. And we report that but what we're really focused on is making sure that we're getting you know billed business acquired. When you look at the composition, obviously, in a stronger environment, you really looking for more organic growth from your existing cardholders. And I just made the comment, before we are small businesses that's not what we're seeing. And so when you look at any growth that you're seeing from a small-business perspective that is truly from new cardholders acquired. And a lot of the growth from a consumer perspective right now is new cardholders acquired which actually as we think about engaging with our cardholders gives me a lot of confidence going forward because as we continue to engage and not only get more wallet share, but as our cardmembers get back to where they were probably before the third quarter and fourth quarter, we believe there is upside there from a billings perspective. We've talked a lot about millennials over time, and we get on this growth trend -- we get on this trajectory with these millennials and Gen Zers, where we start with a higher share of wallet, and we start with that higher share of wallet because they are used to using their American Express card everywhere, and as they move through their lifecycles, their wallets increase. And so we have a lot of confidence in the long-term lifetime value of the millennial base and of the Gen Z base that we're now acquiring. And you see and even in this fourth quarter that is 32% now of our total spending. So when to think about this right now is -- a lot of the growth is coming -- that you're seeing is coming from new card acquisition, but there will be an inorganic step up as the economy gets better. So -- and that gives us a lot of confidence of how we're positioned for future growth over the long-term, which gives us confidence to say aspiration-ally we should be a 10% plus revenue company. And that's why you see the guidance that we've given this year, both from a revenue perspective and EPS perspective.\nKartik Ramachandran: With that, we will bring the call to an end. Thank you for joining today's call, and for your continued interest in American Express. The IR team will be available for any follow-up questions.

I would now like to introduce John Buran, President and Chief Executive Officer, who will provide an overview of the strategy and results. Please go ahead.\nJohn Buran: Thank you, Operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us for our full year and fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. Before reviewing the highlights of the quarter, I wanted to spend a minute discussing the restatement announced yesterday. As we previously disclosed, we have received approximately $7 million or about $0.17 per share of employee retention tax credit payments in 2023. In keeping with our conservative risk profile, we fully reserve for this amount given the uncertainty in the government program which arose late in 2023. This is despite our belief that more likely than not, we will recognize these payments. The 2023 quarters have been restated to account for this change, and this reserve is included in both GAAP and core earnings. Now, moving to the highlights of the quarter. The company reported fourth quarter 2023 GAAP EPS of $0.27 and core EPS of $0.25. For the year, GAAP EPS was $0.96 and core EPS was $0.83. GAAP and core NIM expanded by 7 basis and 18 basis points respectively in the fourth quarter. Core loan yields increased 33 basis points. We run a conservative balance sheet and our office real estate exposure is low with minimal loans in Manhattan. Our liquidity profile has also improved with over $4 billion of undrawn lines and resources or 48% of total assets. Overall, the quarter showed progress on how we're managing this challenging environment. Turning to slide four, I wanted to provide additional detail on how the company has changed over the past year and how it's remained the same. Our interest rate risk position has moved closer to neutral. This provided immediate income in 2023 when rates increased rapidly. The move to neutral positions the bank to manage future changes in rates, while reducing earnings volatility over different rate cycles. We have options to modify the rate position as appropriate, but do not expect to operate at the level of liability sensitivity as we did in the past. What has remained the same is our low level of risk in our loan portfolio. We're a conservative lender. Our percentage of office loans to total loans is at the low end of our peer group. About a third of these loans are medical offices and less than 1% of loans are secured by Manhattan office buildings. We're very happy with our low risk profile as it has served us well through many cycles. Slide five depicts how we have executed our action plan and how we will adjust our priorities in 2024. Our action plan is focused on moving towards interest rate neutral, which we largely completed using interest rate hedges and adding floating rate assets. These actions also had a significant positive impact on our net interest income as we will review in detail later in the presentation. Another one of our objectives was to increase the focus on risk adjusted returns and improving lending spreads. While we achieved progress in this area with loan yields expanding, we recognize we have more work to do in 2024. We also had a goal of deepening customer relationships. Our growth in non-interest bearing deposits in the second half of the year underscores our progress in this area, and we expect this momentum to continue into 2024. Given our significant progress to-date, we're expanding our areas of focus to ensure our long-term success. The first area of focus is on increasing the NIM and reducing volatility. While this is a multi-year initiative, we achieved progress in the fourth quarter of 2023 as our NIM, excluding the episodic items mentioned on this slide expanded five basis points quarter-over-quarter. We also focused on maintaining our credit discipline. Our credit profile has always been conservative and our risk profile will not change as we advance our lending strategy. Building on this, we will preserve our strong liquidity and capital profile. We have a strong financial position today with over $4 billion of undrawn lines and resources. We will continue to build on this foundation in 2024. Lastly, in 2023, we tightened expenses significantly where we could, and this will be an even greater focus in 2024. While fourth quarter expenses were higher than expected, they were driven by increasing DDA balances and strong loan production, the good type of expenses. We will continue to review our cost structure to look for opportunities to become more efficient as we move through the year. Overall, these expanded areas of focus will allow us to navigate the current environment while positioning in the company for long-term profitability. Our loan portfolio is outlined on slide six. We're a low-risk lender with 89% of the portfolio secured by real estate. Our high quality multifamily and investor commercial real estate loans comprise 67% of the total portfolio. As a reminder, these two portfolios have a weighted average debt service coverage ratio of 1.8x and a weighted average loan to value of less than 50%. We have minimal exposure to Manhattan office buildings, which represent approximately 0.6% of net loans. In general, the real estate portfolio has strong sponsors support and excellent credit performance. We remain very comfortable with the quality of our loan portfolio and our stress tests have indicated that our borrowers are resilient. I want to provide context on how we approach our real estate portfolio and why we're so confident in its stability. Slide seven shows two types of multifamily buildings, which as you can see are on opposite ends of the spectrum. The picture on the left is similar to the typical multifamily building in our portfolio. This is a building that has a mix of rent regulated departments and market rents. The average monthly rent in our portfolio is approximately $1,645 compared to over $3,000 for market rents. The total portfolio for these types of buildings is approximately $3 billion with an average loan size of just over $1 million and a weighted average loan to value of 56%, implying a granular mix. Simply put, the type of building we have in our portfolio is stable, low risk and resilient to market volatility. Contrast this with a building on the right, which does not match our risk profile. While this building might look flashy, it's also more upmarket and has greater swings in monthly rent rates. This type of multifamily building is more exposed to market cycles. We have a history of conservative underwriting on multifamily properties. When interest rates were low during the pandemic of 2020, we underwrote these loans with cap rates at 5% or higher, which provides a cushion in value when rates rise and cap rates increase. Also, we underwrite loans at origination to absorb higher interest rates and each loan is stress test. This is one of the reasons why our weighted average debt service coverage ratios are at 1.8x for this portfolio. This high level of coverage reduces risk in this portfolio. As I just mentioned, many of our buildings have a mix of market and rent regulated apartments. Regulated apartment rents are subject to the Rent Guidelines Standards Board approved annual increases, which is why we prioritize having buildings with a mix of market and rent regulated units. Loans that include rent regulated apartments are about 65% of multifamily loans. We have not had annual net charge offs of more than 5 basis points since 2014 in this portfolio. Our conservative underwriting has and will continue to serve us well. Slide Eight shows the types of office properties we lend against and the types we do not. We lend against medical and healthcare offices and largely outer borough, single and multi-tenant properties. Again, these types of properties have much more stability through market cycles. We do not lend against high rise office buildings that have much more volatility as evidenced by recent market dynamics. The total office portfolio is approximately $257 million with $118 million of multi-tenant, $96 million of healthcare medical and $43 million of single tenant. Our average office loan is about $3 million with a weighted average loan to value of 50% and a weighted average debt service coverage ratio of 1.8x. We have zero non-accrual office loans. Slide nine shows examples of the retail commercial real estate we lend to and the types of properties we do not. This portfolio is about $900 million with a significant portion located in Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx. These properties are typically strip malls rather than large shopping malls. The businesses are usually vital to the communities that they serve. The portfolio has a weighted average loan to value of 53% and debt service coverage ratio of approximately 1.9x. The average loan is about $2 million. Credit performance is solid and less than 20% of the loan portfolio has rate resets through at the end of 2024. We believe this high quality portfolio plays a vital role in servicing the needs of local communities on a day-to-day basis. As you can see across our real estate portfolio, we prioritize the same key factors, limited risk exposure, resilience and strong and stable borrowers. Our disciplined risk management approach gives us confidence in the long-term success of our real estate portfolio. Turning to slide 10, you can see the results of our underwriting over time. Our net charge off history is shown on the left. We have a strong history of achieving net charge off levels that are significantly better than the industry. The same can be said about our level of non-current loans compared to the industry. We have been and continue to be a conservative underwriter of credit. In a stress scenario consisting of a 200 basis point increase in rates, a 10% increase in operating expenses, our loan portfolio has a 1.2x debt service coverage ratio. Given this, we continue to expect minimal loss content within the portfolio. Slide 11 shows our other credit metrics with year-over-year declines in non-performing assets and an increase in the non-performing loan coverage ratio. Criticized and classified loans were relatively flat during the quarter. And we expect the criticized and classified loans to gross loans to remain below peer levels. Our allowance for credit losses is presented by loan segment in the bottom right chart. Overall, the allowance for credit losses to loans ratio was stable at 58 basis points during the quarter. We remain very comfortable with our credit risk profile. I'll now turn it over to Tom to provide more detail on our other financial metrics. Tom.\nTom Buonaiuto: Thank you, John. I will begin on slide 12, which outlines the net interest income and margin trends. The GAAP net interest margin expanded seven basis points to 2.29% during the fourth quarter, while the core net interest margin increased 18 basis points to 2.31%. Contributing to the GAAP and core NIM expansion were $3 million of prepayment penalty income, net reversals and recovered interest from nonaccrual loans, purchase accounting accretion, and customer swap termination fees in the fourth quarter compared to $2.6 million in the third quarter. Absent these items, the NIM expanded 5 basis points quarter-over-quarter, which is the first time the quarterly NIM expanded sequentially since the second quarter of 2022. There are two primary factors that should drive the NIM in the near term. First is the level of loan originations and repricing. Second is how well we retain and reprice maturing CDs. With the market expecting rate cuts this year, we estimate every 25 basis point reduction in rates would impact net interest income by approximately $1.4 million on an annualized basis, assuming no deposit rate lag. For the fifth consecutive quarter, yields on loan closings exceeded yields on satisfactions, and this spread increased in every quarter. Turning to slide 13, as John mentioned previously, we added interest rate hedges in 2023 to help neutralize the balance sheet to increases in interest rates. The overall interest rate hedge portfolio is approximately $2 billion and does not have any significant maturities in 2024. These interest rate hedges provided immediate income and helped navigate the rapidly rising rate environment. In a falling rate environment, the income from the interest rate hedges will decline, but there are potential offsets in the balance sheet. Bottom line, the interest rate hedges helped mitigate NIM compression from rising rates and provided immediate income. Slide 14 provides more detail on our deposits. Average deposits increased 3% year-over-year and 1% quarter-over-quarter. The quarterly increase was partially attributable to seasonality and our focus on non-interest bearing deposits. Average non-interest bearing deposits increased $22 million or 3% quarter-over-quarter and remains a top priority for the company. Average CDs increased to 2% quarter-over-quarter to $2 billion. Checking account openings declined 7% in the quarter, but increased 6% in 2023. Overall, we are seeing strong account opening trends and are confident we will continue to build our customer base next year. Our loan to deposit ratio has improved to 101% from 107% a year ago. Slide 15 provides more detail on our CD portfolio. Total CDs are over $2 billion or 34% of total deposits at December 31, 2023. CDs helped to lengthen the duration of our funding. Over $1.5 billion of retail CDs are expected to mature in 2024 at a rate of 4.1%. We expect to retain a high percentage of our CDs as we retained 78% of the retail CDs that matured in the fourth quarter. Current CD rates range from 5% to 5.45%. All else equal, CD repricing is one of the factors that could pressure our net interest margin. Slide 16 provides more detail on the contractual repricing of the loan portfolio. Approximately $1.3 billion or 18% of loans repriced with each Fed move. Our interest rate hedge position on these loans increases this percentage to 25%. For 2024, $744 million is due to reprice at 174 basis points higher than the current yield. In 2025 and 2026, a combined $1.5 billion of loans will reprice about 200 basis points higher. These rates are based on the underlying index value at December 31, 2023, and do not consider any future rate moves. This repricing should drive net interest margin expansion once funding costs stabilize. Our capital position is shown on slide 17. Book value and tangible book value per share increased year-over-year and during the fourth quarter. We repurchased approximately 39,000 shares at an average price of $15.08, which is a 33% discount to tangible book value. The tangible common equity ratio increased slightly to 7.64% quarter-over-quarter. Overall, we view our capital base as a selective source of strength and a vital component of our conservative balance sheet. Slide 18 provides detail on our Asian markets, which account for a third of our branches. We have over $1.3 billion of deposits and $759 million of loans in these markets. These deposits are 19% of our total deposits, and while we have only a 3% market share of this $41 billion market, there is substantial room for growth. Our approach to this market is supported by our multilingual staff, our Asian advisory board, and support of cultural activities through participation and corporate sponsorships. This market continues to be an important opportunity for us and one that we believe will drive our success moving forward. On slide 19, you can see community involvement as a key part of our strategy beyond just our Asian franchise as outlined previously. During the fourth quarter, we participated in numerous local events to strengthen our ties to our customer base. Some of our recent highlights include hosting a ribbon-cutting ceremony at our Bensonhurst branch, which opened in late September, and participating in the Trunk or Treat in Hauppauge and Toys for Tots in Chinatown. Participating in these types of initiatives has served as a great way to further integrate ourselves within our local communities while driving customer loyalty. Slide 20 outlines the growth of our digital banking platforms. We continue to see double-digit growth rates in monthly mobile deposit users, users with active online banking status, and digital banking enrollment. The numerated platform, which digitally originates small-dollar loans as quickly as 48 hours, continues to grow. We originated approximately $19 million of commitments in 2023, and these loans have an average rate greater than the overall loan portfolio yield. Building off the success we had with Zelle, we continue to explore other FinTech product offerings and partnerships to further enhance our digital banking platform and customer experience. Slide 21 provides our outlook. While we do not provide guidance, we want to share our high-level perspective on performance in the current environment. We continue to expect stable loan balances. As is typical, we expect certain deposits to experience normal seasonality in the winter months and decline in the summer. As discussed previously, the two biggest drivers of the net interest margin are first, the level of loan originations and repricing; and second, the retention of CDs and at what rate. For modeling purposes, we suggest starting with the NIM in the 215 range, as this excludes the outsized prepayment penalty and other episodic fees. We expect some pressure from this level of the net interest margin in the near term, driven from CD repricing exceeding loan originations. Non-interest income should benefit from the back-to-back swap loan closings. While non-interest expenses were higher than expected in the fourth quarter, we are bending the expense curve. In the first quarter, we have an increase due to seasonal expenses, but these expenses are expected to be less than half of the $4.1 million recorded in the first quarter of 2023. For the past five years, non-interest expenses grew at a 5.6% compounded annual growth rate. In 2024, this growth rate is expected to be in the low to mid-single digits from a base of approximately $151 million. We are controlling the expenses we can, and disciplined expense management remains one of our top priorities in 2024, as we look to drive operating efficiencies. While tax rates can fluctuate, we expect a mid-20s effective tax rate for 2024. I will now turn it back over to John.\nJohn Buran: Thank you, Tom. On slide 22, I will wrap up with our key takeaways. We established our action plan early 2023 and executed well against it to help create a stronger base to improve profitability over the longer term. Given our successful execution so far, we're shifting our areas of focus to increasing the NIM and reducing volatility, maintaining our credit discipline, preserving our strong liquidity and capital, and bending the expense curve. In short, we're trying to improve near-term performance for the areas that we control amid the persistent challenging environment. We believe these actions will allow us to navigate the current environment and improve overall performance in the long term. Operator, I'll turn it over to you to open up the line for questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mark Fitzgibbon with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nMark Fitzgibbon: Hey, guys. Good morning. Happy Friday.\nSusan Cullen: Good morning, Mark.\nJohn Buran: Good morning, Mark.\nMark Fitzgibbon: First question is just some clarification on the comments you made around margin. So did you say that we should start with a margin level of 215 in the first quarter and then assume there'll be compression from there? Is that correct?\nJohn Buran: That's the \u2013 yeah, so that's the core margin that we have, that we're at as of the fourth quarter. So what's happening in the first quarter is the number of CDs that are repricing will exceed the loans that are repricing. So we could see some small margin compression in the first quarter or so. By the middle of the year, that should abate and start moving the other way as loans, the loan repricing exceeds the liability repricing.\nMark Fitzgibbon: Okay. And then John, I think in your comments, you suggested that you're continuing to reduce liability sensitivity. I guess I'm wondering if it looks like we're getting close to the Fed cut in rates and clearly the balance sheet benefits, as you've described, a $1.4 million for each 25 basis point cut. Why continue to reduce liability sensitivity now? Why not wait until rates come down and benefit, ride the wave so to speak?\nJohn Buran: I don't think we're looking to reduce it any further. We're comfortable being neutral at this point in time. And obviously the market hasn't done such a great job of predicting the number of rate cuts or increases. So given the fact that historically our balance sheet had a heavy liability sensitivity, it still does today at its core basis. So I think that we have options to increase the liability sensitivity in the balance sheet should we see some certainty with respect to the Fed moves, and we're exploring those options. So we haven't made any decisions as to the timing and magnitude of rate cuts at this point in time, and we're watching very carefully what's happening in the market. We've been disappointed before in terms of the Fed making cuts. So we wanted to position ourselves to be successful in either environment.\nMark Fitzgibbon: Okay, and then just to be clear, the restatement that you did this morning, that sort of puts this issue completely behind, there's no residual expense impact or anything like that?\nSusan Cullen: That's correct, Mark. It puts the whole issue behind us and we move forward from here.\nMark Fitzgibbon: Okay, and then just on credit, you guys have done a nice job and certainly your balance sheets held up well. I guess at a high level, I was curious of sort of two things. What do you guys worry about for the industry with respect to credit? Not necessarily Flushing, but just credit in general. And do you see commercial real estate borrowers out there that are really struggling to find a home for their loans or being pushed out by their existing banks?\nJohn Buran: We're starting to see somewhat of that activity. Certainly there's been a commentary in the press of various banks pulling back in the commercial real estate area. Certainly the office market continues to be a soft market throughout the entire industry. So I think those two things are clearly occurring, and we're watchful for opportunities to be a little bit more focused on the loan portfolio in the coming quarters. Obviously we've been kind of flattish over 2023.\nMark Fitzgibbon: Thank you.\nSusan Cullen: Thanks Mark.\nOperator: The next question is from Steve Moss with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSusan Cullen: Good morning, Steve.\nUnidentified Participant: Hello everyone.\nA - John Buran: Good morning Steve.\nUnidentified Participant: Hey. This is Thomas on for Steve, guys. I appreciate it. I appreciate all the call you guys provided on CDs, but I see money market deposit growth resumed after several quarters of decline. And the average yield on that looks like it ticked up about 25 bips to around 3.88%, which looks like to be on the higher end from what I've seen in our coverage. All that said, is it fair to say, especially with rate cuts likely on the horizon here, that the money market deposit bucket is likely near a peak in terms of yield? And I guess piggybacking off that thought, how much of your deposit base is indexed and would potentially immediately reprice downwards with a move in short-term rates? Thank you.\nJohn Buran: It's a relatively small portion that is indexed. We just started a program, I guess in the last quarter or so, and limited it to certain customer segments. So we're being very watchful of that. Obviously, given the fact that the alternatives out there in the CD market have a five handle, we're very, very happy to get a three handle in money markets, and that's growing.\nUnidentified Participant: Okay, I appreciate that. And just one more here. Shifting onto fees, just wondering kind of what is the outlook here on the back-to-back loan swaps? I see that the pipeline looks like it was down with the recent move in rates. So where could we see that line item normalized down to in 2024? Thanks.\nJohn Buran: I think customers in general are a little bit on the sidelines as they are \u2013 the uncertainties and possibly the expectation of rate decreases are still out there and swirling in the market. So depending upon how quickly the Fed starts to move, we may see the more near-term jump in back-to-back swap activity. We\u2019re very, very successful in this area in 2023, but it clearly is an area that is driven by expectation of rate movements at any given point in time. So we have the product, we can turn it on very, very quickly in the event that rates are in a favorable position, but given expectations that rates may be coming down, some borrowers are just kind of holding tight at this point in time.\nUnidentified Participant: Okay, I appreciate all that color. That covers it for me. I'll step back into the queue. Thanks everyone.\nSusan Cullen: Thank you.\nA - John Buran:\nOperator: The next question is from Chris O'Connell with KBW. Please go ahead.\nJohn Buran: Hey, good morning. Chris.\nChris O'Connell: Just wanted to follow-up on one of the comments in the prepared remarks. I think it was for each 25 basis point reduction in rates is an impact of $1.4 million on the annual NII. That's a positive impact, correct?\nSusan Cullen: Correct, and that's assuming there's no lag or 100% beta in the deposit repricing.\nChris O'Connell: Got it, but it is considering the impact of the swaps, right?\nSusan Cullen: Yes.\nChris O'Connell: Great. And then, if you guys have, like are getting into 2025, I know there's not a ton maturing in 2024, but can you remind us of just the maturity schedule of the funding side swaps?\nSusan Cullen: The funding \u2013 in 2025, about $400 million I think matures in 2025.\nChris O'Connell: Got it. So, I guess what I'm getting at\u2026 [Multiple Speakers]\nJohn Buran: Well clearly, I think the general comment, and we may be a little off on the number, but the general comment is we're going to have a bigger opportunity in 2025 to manage asset versus liability sensitivity, because we do have a fair number of swaps coming off.\nChris O'Connell: Yeah, I guess that's what I was getting at, is like that's probably one of the arrows in your guys' quiver that you have over time to maybe increase liability sensitivity if it becomes certain that the Fed is going to be consistently cutting.\nSusan Cullen: Correct. That's a good statement, Chris.\nChris O'Connell: Great. And then, I know you guys gave a lot of good color on the expenses and the relative change from in the past. For the overall, just cadence, is there still going to be like a fairly sizable drop-down in the Q1 to Q2 rate? And then, usually it's fairly flattish after that.\nSusan Cullen: So, we expect the seasonal expenses in the first quarter, Chris, to be about $2 million versus a little over $4 million in the first quarter of 2023. But yes, that $2 million will then start to -- will fall off in the subsequent quarters of 2024.\nChris O'Connell: Great. And that's all I had for now. Thank you.\nSusan Cullen: Great, thanks Chris.\nJohn Buran: Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: The next question is from Manuel Navas with DA Davidson. Please go ahead.\nSusan Cullen: Good morning.\nJohn Buran: Hey, good morning.\nManuel Navas: Pre-payment penalties were a little bit elevated in the fourth quarter. Any color there? And do you have any early indications of where they could land in the next couple of quarters? Do you have any sightline to that?\nSusan Cullen: They were elevated in the quarter. We had a couple of large loans that had swaps associated with them pay off. We're seeing pre-payments about $500,000 to $750,000 would be a normalized rate running forward.\nManuel Navas: Okay, and then the color on the CD repricing, you had current CD rates around 5 to 5.45. That's your CD rates. What is kind of the high in the area?\nA - Susan Cullen: 5.50-ish.\nManuel Navas: Okay, so that's why it's so easy. You generally can keep them, because you're right where the market is.\nSusan Cullen: Right in the ballpark.\nJohn Buran: We'll give you an update on the swap maturities. There are about $325 million of swap maturities taking place in 2025.\nManuel Navas: Okay. I know your guidance kind of encompasses the swaps, but is there \u2013 if you're just looking at the swaps and you have some rate cuts, where does the net benefit move to? Like right now the net benefit's like 2.56%. If there's a 25 basis point cut, where does it move to?\nJohn Buran: We had the $1.4 million on a 25 basis point cut.\nSusan Cullen: Assuming 100% beta.\nManuel Navas: Okay, so you just keep it on the overall guidance. All right, and then any shift in the buyback appetite?\nSusan Cullen: No, not really. We continue with our capital plans. We've always had it that first we want to invest profitably into the company; second, return through dividends; and third, through the buybacks.\nManuel Navas: Okay. I appreciate the comments. Thank you.\nSusan Cullen: Thank you.\nJohn Buran: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to John Buran for any closing remarks.\nJohn Buran: Thank you, operator, and thank you all for attending the conference today. We look forward to presenting to you at the end of the second quarter, and as always, if analysts have any additional questions, we'll make ourselves available. Thank you very much.\nSusan Cullen: Thank you.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor. For more information see our T&C."

        "article_content": " \n\nSouthState Corporation (SSB) reported a solid fourth quarter in 2023 with steady growth in loans and customer deposits, despite a slight decrease in net interest margin (NIM). The company is optimistic about delivering strong shareholder returns post-COVID and expects mid-single-digit loan growth for 2024, particularly in residential real estate and commercial & industrial (C&I) middle market sectors. \nSouthState also anticipates a net interest margin between 3.45% and 3.55% for 2024 based on current interest rate forecasts. The company is considering mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and other capital deployment strategies, such as share repurchases or bond restructuring, to enhance shareholder value.\nSouthState Corporation (SSB) has demonstrated a strong track record of rewarding investors, which is reflected in its consistent dividend growth. The company has raised its dividend for 12 consecutive years and has maintained dividend payments for an impressive 27 consecutive years. These achievements underscore SouthState's commitment to shareholder returns and financial stability.\nIn terms of valuation, SouthState is currently trading at a low P/E ratio of 12.12, which is attractive relative to its near-term earnings growth. This could indicate that the stock is undervalued, presenting a potential opportunity for investors seeking a mix of value and growth.\nThe company's financial health is further evidenced by a robust return over the last three months, with a 28.43% price total return, showcasing investor confidence and market momentum. This performance aligns with the company's positive outlook, as analysts predict SouthState will be profitable this year, backed by profitability over the last twelve months.\nInvestingPro Data metrics provide additional insights into SouthState's financial position:\nFor those interested in a deeper analysis, InvestingPro offers a comprehensive suite of tools and additional \"InvestingPro Tips\" to evaluate potential investments.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Will Matthews. Please go ahead.\nWill Matthews: Good morning, and welcome to SouthState's fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. This is Will Matthews, I'm here with John Corbett, Steve Young, and Jeremy Lucas. John and I will provide some brief prepared remarks and then we'll open it up for questions. As always, a copy of our earnings release and presentation slides are on our Investor Relations website. Before we begin our remarks, I want to remind you that comments we make may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws and regulations. Any such forward-looking statements we may make are subject to the safe-harbor rules. Please review the forward-looking disclaimer and safe-harbor language in the press release and presentation for more information about our forward-looking statements and risks and uncertainties, which may affect us. Now I'll turn the call over to John Corbett, our CEO.\nJohn Corbett: Thanks, Will. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us. You can see in the earnings release that SouthState delivered a solid quarter that was consistent with our guidance. High level, it was another quarter of steady, loan and customer deposit growth with mid-single-digit growth in both. NIM did the couple basis points, but is leveling off and capital ratios are growing nicely. The end of the year is always a time for reflection. As we look back on 2023 and specifically the turmoil last spring, it was a period that demonstrated the resilience of SouthState, particularly the resilience of our granular deposit franchise, the resilience of our asset quality and the resilience of the high-growth markets where we operate. The new census report was issued last month and not surprising, Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia were all on the top five fastest growing states in the country during 2023. And since the pandemic, over one million people have moved to Florida. SouthState is a company that was forged during the Great Recession, during a decade of rapid consolidation. The culmination of that period was a merger of equals announced four years ago this month. That significant event in our history was an opportunity to catch our breath and spend a couple of years to retool the guts of the bank, specifically in the areas of technology and risk management. Our goal is to strengthen the infrastructure without sacrificing our decentralized and entrepreneurial culture. It was painstaking work that affected every area of the bank. We upgraded 20 different technology platforms and increased our annual technology spend by 76%. Annual spending on technology in 2024 is estimated to be $68 million more than it was in 2020. On the risk management side, our program has matured to meet the heightened expectations of the OCC. We upgraded with experienced professionals from the big banks and strengthen the three lines of defense. Now during the first couple of years, those technology and risk management changes took a toll on our employees and impacted the customer experience, but it was short-term pain for long-term gain. So with a larger bank infrastructure in place, our focus pivoted in 2023 to making our employees and customers' lives better, we needed to refine the new technology so that it was serving us, rather than the other way around. And I think we've been largely successful. Employee engagement is now back to the top quartile of our peers. And we're beginning to leverage the power of the new technology. Now in 2024, as we approach the end of the COVID era and hopefully, a more normal yield curve, we believe we can deliver outsized shareholder returns in the future. It's a future that's possible, because of the hard work over the last few years. So I'll close by thanking our team, for preparing us, for this next chapter. I'll pass it back to Will now, to walk you through the details on the quarter.\nWill Matthews: Thank you, John. As you noted, the fourth quarter was a good finish to a year in which SouthState reported solid performance in Soundness, Profitability and Growth while facing a relatively volatile environment. I'll touch on a few details before we move to Q&A. On the balance sheet, fourth quarter annualized loan growth of 5%, brought our full year growth to 7%. Customer deposit growth, excluding the maturing brokered CDs we didn't replace, a 5% annualized approximately matched the loan growth rate. For the full year, total deposits grew 2%, with customer deposits essentially flat. DDAs represented 29% of total deposits at quarter end down another percent from 30% last quarter, leaves near the levels we were pre-pandemic for DDA as a percentage of deposits. Turning to the income statement, our 3.48% NIM was down two basis points from the prior quarter and consistent with our 345 to 350 guidance. Loan yields in Q4 were up 12 basis points and deposits were up 16 basis points, in line with our 15 to 20 basis point guidance. This brings our cycle-to-date loan beta to 36% and our cycle-to-date deposit beta to 30%. Our net interest income of $354 million was essentially flat with the third quarter. For the full year 2023 margin comparison versus 2022, 2023's NIM of 3.63% was 26 basis points higher than 2022s, while the cost of deposits rose from 10 basis points in 2022 to 120 basis points in 2023, in a period of 500 basis points of Fed Rate Hikes not to mention the March crisis. While it's been a challenging period in which to manage a financial institution balance sheet, I think our margin performance during this period of rapid change really highlights the value of our core funding base. Non-interest income of $65 million was down $8 million from Q3 and at 58 basis points of assets was in line with our 55 to 60 basis points guidance. Correspondent revenue was $3.4 million after $12.7 million in interest expense on swap collateral for $16 million in gross revenue, down approximately $9 million from Q3. Wealth had a record quarter with revenue exceeding $10 million. And we had a strong quarter in deposit fees similar to Q3 and last year's fourth quarter. Mortgage revenue continued to be weak, though I'll complement our leadership on their performance in this challenged environment. We track various metrics versus the Mortgage Bankers Association quarterly performance report and our team consistently outperforms the industry in several key metrics. Operating expenses of $246 million which excludes the $25.7 million for the FDIC special assessment were in line with our expectations and were above Q3 levels due to some of the items we mentioned in our third quarter call. Looking ahead, we expect NIE for Q1 in the mid-to-high-240s, subject to normal variations in expense categories impacted by non-interest income and performance. With respect to credit, we recognized $7.7 million in net charge-offs in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $25 million or 9 basis points for the quarter and 8 basis points for the full year. Of the year's net charge-offs, $7 million came from deposit accounts and $18 million from loans for approximately 6 basis points in loan net charge-offs. Our provision expense was $9.9 million for the quarter and $114 million for the year, leaving our ending total reserve to remain approximately flat at 158 basis points of loans. And over the last two years, we've provisioned $196 million against only $29 million in net charge-offs. So we built our reserves appropriately under CECL in advance of potential credit deterioration. For overall asset quality trends, NPAs were up $8 million, driven by an increase in SBA loan non-accruals, which are 75% or more government guaranteed. Speciality loans declined and substandard loans increased. The increase in over 90s is due to utility company storm repair receivables in our factoring business. These typically turn slowly, and the majority of these have been collected since quarter end. Loan past dues were down quarter-over-quarter. 60% of our NPAs are current on payments and the past two NPAs are centered in the SBA, consumer and residential portfolios. I'll reiterate that we do not see significant loss content in our portfolio. C&I line utilization was up 1% in the quarter and home equity line of credit utilization was down slightly. We continue to have very strong capital ratios with a CE Tier 1 of 11.8% or 10.2% if AOCI were included in the calculation. The move down in interest rates caused our AOCI to shrink, helping our ending TCE to grow to 8.2%. Our ending TBV per share grew to $46.3, up $6.23 for the year. During the fourth quarter, we purchased 100,000 shares at a volume-weighted average price of $67.45. We continue to believe risk-weighted asset growth and capital formation rate should be in a range that allows us to continue to grow our regulatory capital ratios and provide us with great flexibility. Operator, we'll now take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Catherine Mealor with KBW. Your line is open.\nCatherine Mealor: Hey, good morning.\nJohn Corbett: Good morning, Catherine.\nCatherine Mealor: Just to start with your margin outlook. The margin came right in line with your guidance for this quarter. I'm just curious how you're thinking about the margin this year, maybe and how you're thinking about how rate cuts impact your margin outlook? Thanks.\nSteven Young: Sure, Catherine. It's Steve. Thanks for asking the question. We have a page that we show every quarter on Page 11 is the NIM trend. And as you mentioned, it went down from 350 to 348, so 2 basis points, that's within our guidance between $345 million and $350 million. Our deposit cost increased 16 basis points, which was within our guidance of 15% to 20%. So as we think about 2024, it's interest earning assets, it's rate forecast and then our deposit beta assumption. So for interest earning assets for the full year 2024, we're sort of just reiterating the $41 billion, that's sort of what we thought about in the last several quarters. So we're thinking 2024, $41 billion. We start out like fourth quarter was in the 40.4% range. So I wouldn't expect that to be much different coming out of the first quarter seasonality. As it relates to the second assumption, which is the rate forecast, the Moody's (NYSE:MCO) consensus, which is what we use, shows 4 rate cuts in 2024. They start in April. And then we have 4 rate cuts in 2025. So you would end the year at 4.5% fed funds in 2024 and our assumption you would hit fed funds rate at 3.50% by the end of 2025. On our deposit beta, Page 17, which is our cycle-to-date beta is 30%, and we would continue to expect deposit cost to increase similarly in the fourth quarter before we get rate cuts sometime in the second quarter is how we see it. So deposit costs between 1.70 to 1.80 in the first quarter. So I guess based on all those assumptions, we would expect the full year NIM to average somewhere between 3.45% and 3.55% for the full year in 2024. And we would sort of expect the first half to be in that 3.40% to 3.50% range and exiting the back half in that 3.50% to 3.60% range. So that's kind of how we're thinking about 2024 with those assumptions. As we think about 2025 and you think about another 4 rate cuts in 2025, we're thinking as we model it somewhere in that 3.55% to 3.65% NIM range in 2025 depending on how we exit. And then just kind of the last point I'll make is if we kind of play this out and the forward curve is sort of showing that at the end of 2025, we sort of have a 3% to 3.5% Fed funds rate in sort of a flat or upward sloping curve. 2026 would look a lot like 2018, 2019 when our NIMs were in the 3.75% maybe 3.90% range. So anyway, as we kind of think about the short, medium and long, that's sort of how we're thinking about it related to the forecast.\nCatherine Mealor: That's really helpful. I think the first one I've gotten 2026 guidance in this earnings season to that. That's helpful.\nSteven Young: You want 2028 [ph], we can interrupt it to.\nCatherine Mealor: I love it. I love it. Yes, this is really helpful. And it just -- it's interesting. It feels like you just got upward momentum in your margin. And I think I'm curious how you're thinking about how deposit costs play into that? I mean, you've got such an opportunity to reprice assets all the way up, even if we get rate cuts, I feel like your loan yields are still going to be moving up, just given the way you're structured there. And so are there significant decline in deposit costs throughout all these assumptions? Or is it more kind of a stabilization in deposit costs? And then just -- and really what's driving the higher margin is just upward momentum on the asset side?\nSteven Young: Yes. No, it's a good question. So maybe start with the asset side. I think we talked about it last quarter, but just to reiterate, we -- in 2024, we have a little over $4 billion of fixed rate and adjustable rate repricing that are going to happen in 2024. I think in 2025, it's like $3.3 billion and 2026 to $3 billion. So it's a healthy amount every year. And so those are somewhere in the 4.60% to 4.80% range for all three of those years, so they're kind of fixed in there. As we think about, so that's going to be a tailwind assuming that the five-year treasury doesn't move much lower than three. They'll be spread over that. If you think about the deposit rates. Our money market accounts, you've seen a big increase in that over the last 12 months. I think if you look in the earnings release, I think our money market accounts went up maybe $3 billion or so, and our CDs went up about $2 billion. And a lot of that was negotiated rates. And so in our total portfolio of deposits, we have about a little over $10 billion of negotiated rates that we've given to our team to -- that they've managed to exception price. On the flip side of that, we have about of $10 billion of floating rate loans. About 30% of our loans is floating. So you kind of look at both of those and they sort of maybe not perfectly offset each other, but help. CDs is another $4 billion that eventually will re-price to the front end of the curve over time. And then the -- we have securities that will reprice. So anyway, I guess the big tailwind to your point, is really trying to manage the floating rate assets versus the negotiated deposits and CDs and then the fixed rate loans over time are sort of your -- your help to margin. I don't know if that's helpful, but for how we think about it.\nCatherine Mealor: Yep. Yeah, that's very, very helpful. All right great thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Scouten with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nStephen Scouten: Hey, good morning, everyone. I'm kind of curious, you mentioned the DDA percentage will with kind of back down to the pre-pandemic level. Do we think this can kind of stabilize here at this level? Or do you expect a little bit more mix shift as we move on maybe prior to potential rate cut?\nWill Matthews: Stephen, it's hard to say. I think a few quarters ago, we probably would have thought this would be where we end up. It's -- given that we've seen a continued decline in that percentage, I don't think it's unreasonable to assume it might go down further from here. I don't know what -- how much for that deal that the pace of that change is mitigated quite a bit the last few quarters. But it's hard to say that we're at the end necessarily, but it's hard to know.\nJohn Corbett: Yeah. And to Will's point, I mean, it's sort of been a situation where it's gone down a 1%, 1.2%. Just when does the Fed pivot and probably at that point is when all that changes, but that's -- that's the $64,000.\nStephen Scouten: For sure. Okay. And how should we think about kind of the provision and reserves moving forward? I mean, obviously, you guys have talked about how much you've built relative to net charge-offs and Will said you don't really see material or significant loss content in the book. So it kind of felt like a big directional reversal this quarter. Maybe what's kind of a normalized net charge-offs for you as you think about your portfolio and do you think we could see this reserve start to trend down given no significant worsening in the portfolio?\nWill Matthews: Yes. Yes, Stephen. I think the way I think about it, our charge-offs last year were 8 basis points. And that's -- they've been very low for the last several years. But I think it's reasonable to expect to normalize a bit from such a low level. And to the extent they do, that would impact provision expense. So we did, as we highlighted, build our reserve the last couple of years in advance of potential deterioration in the economy. But depending on our charge-off levels from here that could lead to provision expense to cover those charge-offs and depending on whatever else the model tells us. As far as normalized charge-offs, I don't have a good number to estimate. I mean, if you look back at peer group, it's certainly be higher than what we've experienced, but I think it's hard to say for certain that we could hang in there below 10 basis points every year in net charge-offs, but it'd be great if we could.\nStephen Scouten: Okay. Good. And then just last thing for me. Maybe to John, this is maybe more your side of the coin here, wondering around M&A in this environment. Obviously, I know '23 was a tough year, but you guys turned phenomenally well. So a relatively advantaged currency rate presumably coming down, making the math a little bit better? I'm just kind of wondering how you think about M&A this year and the potential for executing a deal.\nJohn Corbett: Yes, sure. As I've said previously, we were open for business. And to your point, I suspect that the math is becoming easier with the lower interest rate marks. But Stephen, really no change from our prior guidance. I mean our ideal partner, if we were to do something, would be 10% to one-third of our pro forma company. We're in great markets in the Southeast, and we prefer to double down in our existing high-growth markets, but the regulatory environment is a little tough for that right now. So we've updated our population map on page 6. And if we were to do a market extension type of deal, we need to be in a similar high-growth market like Tennessee or Texas. But from a capital management standpoint, I think we're in a good spot with excess capital, and we've got flexibility to use that capital. We can deploy it in share repurchases. We bought a little bit of shares back in the fourth quarter. We could do a bond restructure or we could deploy it at M&A.\nStephen Scouten: Yes. Helpful commentary, John. Thanks a lot guys. Appreciate the time.\nJohn Corbett: You bet.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rose with Raymond James. Your line is open\nMichael Rose: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to get some comments on slide 12, which is the loan production chart. Obviously, it's come down since a very strong 2022. I know some of that is just your kind of conservative nature and maybe not wanted to take on other people's credits as they move out of the banks. But just given your footprint, just wanted to get some thoughts on loan growth expectations as we think about the year, where are areas that you can maybe push the gas pedal a little bit. And I would assume that some of the CRE portfolios are some areas where you'd be a little bit more cautious. But I think you had previously kind of talked about mid-single-digit loan growth rate for next year. So just wanted to get some context there. Thanks.\nJohn Corbett: Yes, Michael, it's John. That graph is very interesting to me on page 12, and we kind of had peak record production in the second quarter of 2022. And if you think back, well, what happened in the second quarter of 2022, that's when the Fed started raising short-term interest rates and precipitously after that, you've seen a steady trend downward of production. So the Fed is getting what it wants. For 2023, we guided to mid-single-digit growth for the year, and we ended at 7% growth. So, given the uncertain economies, I feel like that's a very appropriate level of growth with where we are in the cycle. Pipelines for the end of the year are down considerably from where they were at the beginning of '23, down about 25%. But even though the pipelines are slowing down, Michael, there's kind of an embedded tailwind of loan growth because with rates where the others going to be slowing prepayments and there's continuing to be funding of loans that are unfunded that we made in 2021, '22. So, our guidance really hasn't changed. We think mid-single-digit growth is reasonable and until rates decline. But where do we see that growth for us, we've seen a considerable amount of residential real estate growth in 2023. And we're getting a nice coupon for that growth and there's just more people moving into our markets than there are homes available. So I feel good about those credits from an asset quality standpoint. CRE activity has been very low in 2023 with the rise in rates. You might see a little pickup there in 2024 with the five-year treasury down as much as it is. And then we've just got a continuous push on the C&I middle market space. So that's an area that we're leaning into. So I hope that's helpful, Michael.\nMichael Rose: Very much so. And then maybe just one for Steve. I think you stepped down and corresponded -- this quarter was a little bit greater than what some of us were kind of expecting. I know there's typically kind of a seasonal rebound in the first quarter. Can you just kind of walk us through the dynamics there? And I think you had previously kind of talked about a fee to average assets kind of in the 55 to 65 basis point range. Any reason to think that, that might be different as we progress through the 2024? Thanks.\nWill Matthews: Sure. Thanks, Mike, for the question. Yeah. On Page 31 is our fee income percentage. You can see that it was $65 million this quarter, 58 basis points of average assets. And of course, that was within our guidance. We said at the low-end of the 55% to 65% range in the fourth quarter just with what we saw. Our -- we're just kind of reiterating the same guidance for 2024. We would sort of expect non-interest income to average assets to be in the 55 to 65 basis points for the full year. It's going to start on the lower end of the range, like the fourth -- like we had in the fourth quarter for the first half of the year and probably the upper end of the range in the back half of the year. And the reasoning for that is just sort of the yield curve normalizing and sort of our interest rate-sensitive businesses like mortgage and correspondent -- they just performed better when things are a little bit more normal from that perspective. So as you kind of take that into 2025, we would expect our non-interest income to average assets to return to that 60 to 70 basis points, which was approximately the 2022 level. So the way I kind of think about the variability in margin and our kind of our interest-sensitive businesses is we need a little bit more yield curve normalization for those things to sort of get back to, I'll call it, more normal levels. So that's kind of how we're thinking about it. And like you mentioned, correspondent with the -- and mortgage, although mortgage is probably less volatile at this point. But correspondent, I don't think that probably if you think about the fixed income business until they start cutting rates, that's probably not going to improve a lot our interest rate swap business because of the lack of loan volume in the industry in the fourth quarter, probably in the first quarter, it's probably not going to ramp towards the back half of the year as rates stabilize.\nMichael Rose: Very helpful. And then maybe if I can just squeeze one more in for John. Just reflecting on your comments at the beginning of the call around technology costs, I think I was struck by how much the spend has increased in three years' time or four years' time, up $68 million. As you think about going forward, just conceptually, any larger technology products or rehauls that you need to do? Or is it just more around the edges because that's a pretty big lift in costs in a couple of years? Thanks.\nJohn Corbett: Yeah, sure. I think our motto for 2023 was building a better bank and really was focused on the customer experience, the employee experience and getting feedback from our team, how to take friction out of the technology. For 2024, it's kind of finished the drill is the theme, and it's really the technology and process improvements that were already put in place the last couple of years. We just want to complete those projects. So there's really not, Michael, new significant technology platforms that we've got in the queue to update. So I think the bulk of our technology spending increases is in the rearview mirror. I mean there's always going to be growth in that category, but nowhere near the level we've seen in the last few years.\nSteven Young: Michael, this is Steve. The only other comment I would make is, remember, when we did the MOE back four years ago, that was one of the main reasons we did it. There was an investment in technology that we needed to make. And so we use that period as an opportunity to take cost out of certain areas and reallocate it to the technology. And so that's sort of been the story in the last several years.\nMichael Rose: Make sense. Thanks for all the color.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brandon King with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nBrandon King: Hey, good morning.\nJohn Corbett: Hi, Brandon.\nBrandon King: So I appreciate the near-term guidance on expenses, but are you expecting expenses to stay in that similar range throughout the year? Or what kind of growth rate do you think is a good base case assumption?\nWill Matthews: Yes, Brandon, thanks. I'd say for the full year, I think around that $1 billion number is about what we would expect at this point. There are, of course, some components of compensation, et cetera, that fluctuate with revenue volumes in some of the fee businesses in particular, if that turns out differently, then we expect those could move up or down. But for the full year, I think consensus has us right around $1 billion, and that feels like a pretty good spot based on what we see today.\nBrandon King: Okay. And on fees, with the CFPB overdraft proposal, are you considering any potential changes to your overdraft policies? And I guess if not, what could be the potential impact if that does go into effect?\nSteven Young: Yes, Brandon, it's Steve. We made some changes, maybe 15 to 18 months ago. We aren't contemplating any new changes. I know there was a new paper that came out a few days ago. But as I understand it, the earliest that would be approved is in October 2025. So I think it's probably just too early. And, of course, we're thinking about it. But we haven't run the math on any effect that would have on us for sure. But anyway, that's how we're thinking about it.\nBrandon King: Okay. And then lastly, on deposit pricing. I know CDs continue to be a headwind near-term, but could you potentially quantify or give some context around near-term CDP pricing, and then as you're looking in doing the numbers, when could that potentially turn into a tailwind maybe either in 2024 through 2025.\nSteven Young: Sure, Brandon. This is Steve. I think we have about $4 billion of CDs. I think 90% of that roughly come due in 2024. We have a fair amount coming due in the first quarter, I want to say it's not quite half, but it's a fair amount. So as we think about repricing, we're just -- CDs by nature, retail CDs are generally pretty short in nature, and we retooled a couple of our retail products to continue to shorten those up. But at the end of the day, CDs only make up 12% of our total deposits. So it will be a little bit of a tailwind. I think the exception price for negotiated rates on the money markets, probably the place we put more liability sensitivity as we thought about it.\nBrandon King: Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.\nJohn Corbett: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Samuel Varga with UBS. Your line is open.\nSamuel Varga: Hi, good morning, everyone.\nJohn Corbett: Good morning.\nSamuel Varga: I wanted to go back to the margin discussion just for a little bit. Just to clarify on the -- obviously, I'm not digging too far into the 2025 and 2026 guys, but just to clarify, you're assuming that the mid- to longer end of the curve is staying flattish other levels. So there's a flat curve?\nSteven Young: Yes. If you look at the Moody's consensus forecast, I believe that today, all that five-year part, which is where we put a lot of our assets is somewhere in the 4% range. I want to say by the end of 2025, it's in that 3.5% range, give or take a sort of a flat curve by the time they cut rates and so on. So that's sort of our assumption for rates. We don't see if the five-year part of the curve went up to 5%, of course, our repricing would be stronger, but we might have other issues. And if the five-year goes down to 3%, the next year, then there's probably other rate issues. But anyway, that's help.\nSamuel Varga: But you were saying that for the end of 2025, Steve, so there is at the end of 2024 is Moody\u2019s consensus is a little higher than that.\nSteven Young: It's a little higher than somewhere between 350 and 375, I think. And then by the end of 2025, it's around 3.5. So \u2013 yes. As you know, at the end of October, I think when we had our earnings call, I think the five-year treasury Moody's consistence was 4% like 4.5%. So it does move count for sure. So we'll find out for sure.\nSamuel Varga: Got it. Thank you. That's very helpful. And then in terms of the down betas for 2024, what sort of assumptions do you have there for deposit down betas?\nSteven Young: Yes. Let me take a bit of a longer-term view because there's always a lag in all of this. But from our experience and from our modeling, as I think about our betas, I would say on the down betas, it's about 20% total. So for instance, if I kind of run the map on where a 5.5% fed funds rate. And over the next couple of years, they cut it to 3.5% or 200 basis points, you would expect from our peak, maybe 40 basis points of pressure to be relieved coming back by 2026. I know, I'm not suppose to talk about 2026, but it is a linear ramp, and it takes time to do it. But that would be really consistent, if you kind of look back at our history, it's a 20% beta, but there's always a little bit of a lag in that first couple of rate cuts.\nSamuel Varga: That makes sense. And just a quick one. Do you happen to have the spot -- interest-bearing deposit costs for December or year-end?\nSteven Young: No, we don't \u2013 not here in front of me or John.\nSamuel Varga: All right. No problem. Thanks for answering my questions. I appreciate it.\nSteven Young: You bet.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Russell Gunther with Stephens. Your line is open.\nRussell Gunther: Hey, good morning, guys. Just a couple of quick clarifiers at this point. The 20% down beta you're contemplating that through the cycle, and that would compare to the update of roughly 30%. Did I hear that right?\nSteven Young: Yes, that's right.\nRussell Gunther: Okay. Very good.\nSteven Young: And that would be a total -- with total deposit beta.\nRussell Gunther: Yeah. Okay. Excellent. Understood. Thank you. And then just lastly, as you guys kind of balance, you mentioned the potential for a bond structure versus buying back stock. Just kind of walk us through the thought process there. And then if you could confirm any potential bond structure that would get done would be likely accretive to that NIM guidance for 2024?\nSteven Young: Russell, it's Steve. Yeah. We've talked about that on the call. I think it was last quarter, we talked about it. And I think it's the same kind of calculus. So it's really just trying to think about our uses of capital. I think we talked up to maybe a 10% more than 15% of our portfolio restructure. And obviously, we'd be thinking about it in terms of earn-back, period less than three years. That's how we would think about it. It's a lever. We're thinking about what we're kind of just back to positioning the balance sheet, thinking about the future, if rates come down, we are thinking about liability sensitivity a little bit, and we want to think about how to position if rates do fall how to best position all the balance sheet. And of course, that takes time to do it. But we've been thinking about it for the last couple of quarters. Certainly, we want to think about it for the next 4 or 5. So that's from a perspective of the bond restructure. It's certainly something on the table. And to your point, it's a lever if they continue to have higher rates and our NIM has some pressure, that's a way that we can level set it. But that's just on restructure on the capital side.\nWill Matthews: Yes. And as you noted, I mean, with the 11.8% CET1 that does give us the luxury of considering more than one option. And certainly, share repurchases are users capital that we think about as well. And where we sit today, based on our forecasted risk-weighted asset growth and capital formation rate, if we don't do any of those things, you're going to see that CET1 continue to climb from there. So we like the flexibility we've got with our capital position today and we'll continue to think about all of those options we mentioned.\nRussell Gunther: That's great, guys. I appreciate you taking my questions. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gary Tenner with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.\nGary Tenner: Thanks. Good morning.\nWill Matthews: Good morning.\nGary Tenner: I wanted to ask about kind of the earning asset mix for 2024. You talked about, I think, flattish earning assets from the fourth quarter level with what looks like somewhere in the range of $1.5 billion of net loan growth. So from a funding perspective of that loan growth, what are the cash flows projected about the series portfolio for the year? And how lean would you run cash as you're thinking about kind of remixing the asset side of the balance sheet a little bit?\nSteven Young: Sure. I guess this really -- I don't think it's changed a whole lot as you think about if we have mid-single-digit loan growth, that's -- I don't know, $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion of that. We have our securities portfolio that's running off somewhere depending on rates, $700 million, $800 million a year. So that would imply that you have about 2% to 3% deposit growth assumptions built in there. We think it's slow in the front end, it probably ramps in the back end. If you think about QT and all that stuff, they end up bringing that back, I would imagine that liquidity in the system would get better in the back half. But -- so just to make sure I was clear, our average -- our expected average for the year of earning assets is $41 billion are -- if it will start out a little lower than that, of course, end up a little higher than that based on this assumption.\nGary Tenner: Okay. I appreciate that. And then just with the commentary in the press release with -- of the reduction in brokered deposits, can you tell us what the brokered balances are at year-end?\nWill Matthews: I don't have that in front of me, but I think it's around $700 million -- $720 million or so. We've really brought that down over -- during the March banking situation, we took it up $1.2 billion just to make sure that we had plenty of liquidity, fortress balance sheet and then a source that's run off quite a bit over the year. As I think about 2024, at least in the first half, I certainly think we'll replace those and potentially grow it a little bit, but it will be somewhere in that range. Historically, we run about 3% of average deposits. So it'd be about $1 billion somewhere in that $500 million $1.5 billion range. I don't know somewhere in there is typically how we run it depending on rates.\nGary Tenner: Great. That\u2019s very much.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call to John Corbett for closing remarks.\nJohn Corbett: All right. I know you guys have had a busy morning with a lot of calls. So thank you for joining us. If we can provide any other clarity on your models, don't hesitate to give us a ring. And I hope you have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. We thank you for joining.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Karen Bauer, Vice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Strategy and Treasurer.\nKaren Bauer: Good morning, and thank you for joining the Badger Meter fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Ken Bockhorst, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Wrocklage, Chief Financial Officer. The earnings release and related slide presentation are available on our website. Quickly, I'll cover the Safe Harbor, reminding you that any forward-looking statements made during this call are subject to various risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are outlined in our press release and SEC filings. On today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial metrics. Our earnings slides provide a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial metrics used. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken.\nKen Bockhorst: Thanks, Karen, and thank you all for joining our call. We capped off a record year with strong fourth quarter results across sales, operating profit earnings per share and cash flow metrics. Demand trends remained robust, and our continued manufacturing conversion allowed us to again make modest headway into the order backlog. Shortly after year-end, we added to our suite of smart water offerings acquiring the Telog/Unity network monitoring assets, as previously announced. I want to thank all of our employees for their efforts in delivering another fantastic year for Badger Meter. I'll talk more about the acquisition, provide a recap of the year and discuss our outlook later in the call. For now, I'll turn it over to Bob to go through the details of the quarter.\nBob Wrocklage: Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 4. Our total sales in the fourth quarter were in line with our expectations at $182.4 million, up 24% compared to $147.3 million in the same period last year. This brought our full year 2023 sales to a new milestone exceeding $700 million, specifically $703.6 million or 24% above 2022 sales of $565.6 million. Total utility water product line sales increased 28% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and the same percentage on a full year basis. As we have noted all year, demand for our suite of utility smart water solutions continued to benefit from underlying secular growth drivers, coupled with the differentiated performance of our innovative offerings. In the quarter, we delivered on continuing strong cellular AMI demand, which translated into higher sales of ORION Cellular endpoints, E-Series Ultrasonic meters and BEACON Software-as-a-Service revenue. Additionally, water quality and pressure monitoring sales contributed to the top line growth. There were a few highlights within the full year sales growth that I'd like to touch on. First, Software-as-a-Service revenues exceeded $42 million in 2023, up 27% year-over-year. Our international utility revenue grew more than 30% year-over-year, albeit from a small base. Syrinix, which we acquired at the beginning of 2023, delivered pro forma sales growth of approximately 60%, also from a small base, a sign of both broader market adoption and our early integration efforts. And while we again saw a slight increase in the penetration of ultrasonic meters as a percent of our metering units, mechanical meters continuing to command a leading position in the North American utility market for customers of all sizes for a variety of fundamental reasons. Turning to the flow instrumentation product line. Sales grew modestly in the quarter and were up 7% on a full year basis with solid demand experienced in water-related markets partially offset by lower sales associated with the deemphasized general industrial markets. Looking at margin performance, continued strong execution at both the gross margin and SEA lines contributed to the robust 230 basis point increase in operating margins in the fourth quarter, reaching a record 17.6% and versus 15.3% in the comparable quarter last year. Gross profit dollars increased $14.5 million year-over-year and as a percent of sales increased 50 basis points to 39.2% and versus 38.7% last year. The combination of higher volumes and favorable product mix led to the solid year-over-year improvement. We remain pleased with overall gross margins demonstrating the gradual yet durable structural mix benefit inherent within our smart water portfolio. SEA expenses in the fourth quarter were $39.4 million, an increase of $4.9 million year-over-year, which included higher personnel-related costs such as headcount, salaries and annual bonus incentives. The addition of Syrinix with its related intangible asset amortization also contributed to the dollar increase. Yet as we have demonstrated all year, even with the higher spend levels to support growth, SEA as a percent of sales declined 180 basis points to 21.6% in the fourth quarter from 23.4% in the comparable prior year period. Our effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter was a bit higher than the full year average at 26.1%. Incorporating that effective tax rate as well as interest income on our cash balances, we delivered EPS of $0.84 compared to $0.60 in the prior quarter, representing a 40% improvement. Working capital as a percent of sales was 22.1% consistent with the prior year-end. While overall working capital increased in total dollars to support growth, we were pleased with the overall working capital efficiency. Recognizing we have improvement opportunities in inventory as we move forward. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter was a record $35.9 million and improved from a year ago primarily on the higher earnings. For the full year, free cash flow was a record at $98.1 million with free cash flow conversion of net earnings at 106%. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken.\nKen Bockhorst: Thanks, Bob. Turning to Slide 5, I want to spend a few minutes on our recently announced tuck-in acquisition. The Telog brand of remote telemetry units, or RTUs, along with the Unity monitoring software, bring additional capabilities to our smart water offerings in the form of remote monitoring access across utility wastewater, storm water and source water applications. It also brings talent with the expertise to assist our customers in applying these capabilities. For example, the acquired hardware portfolio adds certain complementary products such as hydrant mounted pressure devices and flexible RTUs for external sensor integrations. These products are cellular enabled and add flexibility and edge computing for real-time monitoring. The devices connect seamlessly to a secure cloud software platform with a GIS-centric interface robust device management, flexible dashboards and a suite of analytical tools that enable data-driven decision-making. Application examples range from the monitoring of water depth at an aquifer or well in a water stressed region utilizing a single sensor to a full suite of instruments at a pumping station to monitor flow, level, pump health, water quality, pressure and more. While overall modest in size with sales and purchase price in the mid-single-digit range in millions, we believe these added solutions bolster our growing capabilities in full network monitoring and continue to competitively differentiate Badger Meter's suite of offerings in the market. Moving on to Slide 6, finishing out 2023 represents a bit of a milestone for me, 5 years as the CEO of Badger Meter. During that time, the Badger Meter team has done a tremendous job evolving and advancing what was already a good business into a great one, through developing and executing on our growth strategy. First and foremost, I'd call out our evolution to a smart water management company effectively leveraging our innovation leadership and targeted acquisitions to build on the suite of tailorable solutions ready to address the persistent macro challenges facing the water industry. We've executed a multiyear transition to more direct sales efforts, building out our team of experts across smart metering, advanced communication technologies, water quality, full water network monitoring and software. We've built on the trust earned over our nearly 119 years, becoming an even more valued partner to our customer base. We've advanced the culture of continuous improvement across not just operations, but working capital management, pricing excellence, talent management and development and sustainability really across all of our enterprise business processes, which have enabled our record results. The tangible outcome of these efforts are displayed here on Slide 7. We've distinguished our performance by executing our strategies exceptionally well in the face of a multitude of macro challenges. For example, in the past 5 years, we've delivered over 13% and compounded annual growth rate in total sales now exceeding the $700 million milestone revenue run rate. We've grown our software revenues at a 28% CAGR to over $42 million. We've improved our margins, reaching 16% operating profit as a percent of sales in 2023, with 220 basis points of improvement over pre-COVID levels despite inflation and supply chain challenges. We've reduced our working capital intensity and consistently generated free cash flow in excess of 100% of net earnings, enabling our ability to continue as the innovation leader in our market, return cash to shareholders in the form of dividends, achieving dividend aristocrat status with a track record of 31 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. And to execute value accretive acquisitions to further enhance our portfolio of smart water solutions. I couldn't be more proud of the global team's achievements over the past 5 years. Finally, turning to our outlook, I'm even more excited about the next 5 years as I've been about the past 5. At a macro level, our solutions continue to see growing adoption as we address the variety of persistent macro water challenges customers face enabling them to be more efficient, resilient and sustainable with their water systems. Our durable business model is underpinned by replacement driven demand, secular AMI adoption drivers and expanding need for real-time water quality information and a growing proportion of recurring SaaS revenues. Our strong backlog, along with constructive customer budgets and inventory levels are supportive of future sales growth. Although as we've consistently communicated, the rate of top line growth is expected to moderate from recent levels and will not be linear in delivery. This rate of growth moderation is simply law of larger numbers math. Finally, while not anticipated to be meaningful, incremental opportunities associated with infrastructure funding could provide modest potential upside, and we are well-positioned to capitalize on them. The continuation of positive structural sales mix and SEA leverage drivers demonstrated in our business are expected to provide gradual margin improvement year-over-year. Finally, our cash flow generation and debt free balance sheet provide us with ample capacity to execute our capital allocation priorities, including an attractive funnel of organic and inorganic strategic growth investments. I want to again thank the entire Badger Meter team for their tremendous efforts and accomplishments in 2023, and I look forward to executing on the many opportunities ahead. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Nathan Jones from Stifel. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nNathan Jones: Good morning, everyone.\nKen Bockhorst: Good morning, Nathan.\nNathan Jones: I guess I will just start off with a couple of questions on the outlook. I mean you guys have said long-term the business should kind of be in that mid single to high single-digit organic growth rate, you've clearly been running significantly ahead of that over the last few years. Is that kind of the range that we should expect for 2024? Or are there anything that you see in 2024 that would meaningfully deviate you from the long-term kind of average outlook?\nKen Bockhorst: Yes. Thanks, Nathan. So we -- as you pointed out, we used to say a few years back that we were in that mid single digits throughout the strategic cycle. As you know, we don't provide guidance for quarters or years. We talk in strategic cycles. And for the past year or so, we've been talking pretty openly about being confident to be in the high single digits through the strategic mode, and we feel certainly reinforcing that today that our outlook is something that we are excited about. We still come into the year with a tremendous amount of positivity and tailwinds. I know everyone likes to talk about backlog, and we don't provide guidance on that either. But an interesting point would be that coming into 2024, our backlog is still higher than it was coming into 2023. So optimism still remains strong going forward.\nNathan Jones: I guess the question -- a follow-up question to that is the strategic cycle then. Can we start that from kind of 2023 and say your expectation is maybe high single digits over the next 5 years? Because I mean if I looked at it from, say, 2021, then it would be a different kind of outlook because you considerably outperformed that over the last few years.\nKen Bockhorst: Yes. Yes, Nathan, that is safe to say we are talking about going forward, not including the double-digit performances of the past couple of years.\nNathan Jones: Great. I think that's helpful. Maybe on incremental margins, maybe just one for Bob, kind of expectations as we go into 2024 or over the next strategic cycle, are there any increased incremental investments you need to make to support growth or anything like that, that might impact the long-term outlook for incremental margins and where does that sit today?\nBob Wrocklage: Yes. So I would say really no change from our historic position. We think about ourselves at both the OP and EBITDA line as being 25% incrementals. It just so happened that this Q4 that we are talking about was modestly ahead of that. But if you look at the full year, pretty much right in that zone. So no real change moving forward.\nNathan Jones: Awesome. Thanks very much for taking the questions. I will pass it on.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Andrew Krill from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Krill: Hey, thanks. Good morning, everyone. I kind of wanted to follow-up on the incremental question and related to that the SEA costs, I think, as a percent of sales dropped a lot year-over-year, which was impressive. I just wanted to ask, any other color you can provide on kind of what help you drive this? Was it simply holding costs steady while you grew your sales impressively and do you think you can sustain kind of that below 22% of sales going forward?\nBob Wrocklage: Yes. So I mean, as in any case, a single quarter doesn't make a year and a year does not make a strategic plan. I think the way I would think about it is, yes, clearly, Q4 had a lower rate of SEA as a percent of sales. If you look at 2023 as a whole, our SEA as a percent of sales was 22.5%. That's about 100 basis point improvement over 2022. I would say, we often talk about SEA percent as an opportunity for leverage and as an opportunity to drive EBITDA and operating profit expansion year-over-year. We are a continuous improvement based business. And so I would continue to expect us to be able to accrete that. But sizing that is not something we will do. But again, 21.6% is an outlier that helped us to get to 22.5% for the year. And I think as we would say, with many aspects of our business, we strive to make those improvements year-over-year.\nAndrew Krill: Okay, great. And then next, just I noticed in the press release, there was some new text about water quality and pressure monitoring contributing to your growth. So just can you size or kind of dimensionalize how big those businesses are now? Maybe add it to your kind of growth rates going forward?\nBob Wrocklage: So we won't size them. I mean, traditionally, we talk about those businesses for the first year after acquisition and then they sort of fold into the base, if you will. I think the purpose in that specific comment is to say, yes, they're growing. If you think about our high single-digit growth that Ken spoke to, and again, all those businesses are reported as part of the utility water line of business. If we were to take that high single-digit growth over the strategic cycle, we do think about those pieces maybe growing faster than high single digits. But again, they're starting from a much smaller base, a base that we won't size.\nKaren Bauer: [Indiscernible] in the high single-digit.\nBob Wrocklage: Yes.\nAndrew Krill: Okay, great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Rob Mason from Baird. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nRob Mason: Yes, good morning. Ken, you may just in framing the outlook high single digits, as well as you go forward. You did make a comment around -- it won't always be linear, which I understand as well. And I suppose we saw that in the fourth quarter with fewer shipping days that you had called out as well. I'm just curious as we go forward, is there anything to think about here in the first quarter that's anomalous like that? Or just maybe how we should think about it from a linearity standpoint to start the year?\nKen Bockhorst: Yes. So I would think over the long-term, I think everybody appreciates the nonlinearity piece. The only piece I'd highlight about the first quarter is, obviously, during 2022, as we delivered the roughly $704 million of sales, there was a ramp Q1 to Q2 to Q3. And so the only thing I'd call about Q1 2024 is it's against an easier comp, but that's one quarter within four.\nRob Mason: Yes. Okay. Fair enough. Also, for the year, you finished up with capital spending it was up year-over-year like you had thought, but at a level that's -- was a good bit above recent history. I'm just curious how we should think about your level of investment as we enter '24 around that number, would it go down, sustain at that level?\nKen Bockhorst: Yes. So Rob, while the number is up on a year-over-year basis, it's still pretty small. I think if you compare it to anyone else in the industry or just in general industry. So I think we are at a period where we've had significant growth, and we've had to make some investments in capacity in certain product lines that I would suspect we'll continue at about the rate that we are at, but we are not certainly not looking at any significant increases from where we are today.\nRob Mason: Okay. Just last question. Ken, you touched on the new assets that you're bringing in from Trimble, could you speak about the go-to-market capabilities there that come with that? What you're maybe able to overlay with that? And just trying to think about opportunities for sales leverage or sales synergies with this business with you.\nKen Bockhorst: Yes. Yes, sure. So while -- again, as I pointed out, it's relatively small. Having said that, it's really powerful. So this is just a really nice extension of how we build out the water quality. And then as Bob mentioned before, we integrate that into our utility business and our sales channels. We followed that with Syrinix with the pressure monitoring and pressure loggers and more software. And now Telog is just another example where RTUs have been on our strategic roadmap here for a couple of years. So we are really excited to bring in the RTUs to add more collection points throughout a distribution system or a wastewater facility. So the ability to integrate this won't be that won't be that difficult. So we've already begun working through it. Our distribution partners, our sales team really understands what it takes to make this part of the business. We've been extremely happy with how we've integrated water quality and Syrinix. I think we have a model to do this, and I think we'll hit the ground running quickly with Telog.\nRob Mason: Very good. Thank you.\nKen Bockhorst: Sure.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question today comes from Ryan Connors from Northcoast Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nRyan Connors: Great. Thanks for taking my question. First off, I wanted to congratulate you on your clean numbers again. It's really appreciated that you guys don't resort to a lot of the non-GAAP stuff. And I think your numbers are particularly impressive when you consider a lot of your peers are trying to adjust their way to success. So it's good to see the way you report cleanly. But my couple of questions were, first off, in regard to -- going back to the prior question on kind of channels to market, has your approach to channel to market changed at all, Ken? I know that a few years ago, Badger was very aggressive on buying forward and vertically integrating down into the channel. And we've heard some talk recently that the company is actually going back to third-party distribution in certain targeted territories. Are those just one-off things? Or has your perspective there changed and you're looking to go back to broader third-party footprint.\nKen Bockhorst: Yes. Ryan, one of the things I think you've come to know about us is we talk a lot about continuous improvement and regular cycles where we review the business, and we tweak as required. Our strategy hasn't changed at all. There are certain areas of the country where perhaps picking up a distributor for a particular region might make sense. There's other cases where we take things direct because it makes more sense. So our overall mix of how much is sold direct versus how much is sold through distribution hasn't changed at all. These are just minor tweaks.\nRyan Connors: Got it. Okay. And then my other question was just on the competitive environment. And obviously, it's been a very noisy time for the industry. I think Badger Meter performed exceptionally well in terms of your supply chain management relative to some of your peers. But now that, that whole situation is normalized, I know there's something, well, maybe some of those peers will be tougher competitors going forward than they had been for a while when they were really struggling with that aspect of things. So I wonder if you can comment on that in terms of the competitive environment? And also in terms of the new entry, I know [indiscernible] has been getting a lot of press and out there and a lot of the trade shows making noise about what they're doing. And I'm curious whether you had any comment on just the competitive landscape and how it's evolving.\nKen Bockhorst: So two things. As again, I'm sure you know and expect, we spend a lot of time understanding every single competitor, how they're doing, what they offer, how that compares to us. And the one thing we've always been confident in is that we offer the most unique, broadest and best portfolio for our customers, whether that be mechanical meters plus ultrasonic, whether that's drive by radios plus the lead in cellular for a decade, whether that's the best-in-class software to tie the whole thing together front to back. We absolutely have a portfolio advantage that we can and will continue to defend. And even as others continue to maybe get better with their supply chains, ours never slowed down and it's in a continued position to keep going. Then when you add to that our growing portfolio of being able to bundle solutions with water quality, pressure monitoring, RTUs. Other people have tried to come in, they just can't match our portfolio and our 119 years of selling in the region. So we respect every competitor. We respect every entrant, we feel uniquely positioned to continue to outperform.\nRyan Connors: Yes. Well, it's evident in the results, so congrats on a great '23. Best of luck.\nKen Bockhorst: Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I'll now hand back over to Karen Bauer for any final remarks.\nKaren Bauer: Great. Thank you. Thanks to everyone for joining our call. For your planning purposes, our first quarter 2024 call is tentatively scheduled for April 18. I'll be around all day to take any follow-up questions you might have. Have a great weekend.\nOperator: Thank you for joining today's Badger Meter Q4 2023 earnings call.

A reconciliation of these measures to the nearest GAAP measure may be found in the appendix to this presentation, which is posted on our website at ir.hilltop-holdings.com. With that, I would now like to turn the presentation over to President and CEO, Jeremy Ford (NYSE:F).\nJeremy Ford: Thank you, Erik, and good morning. Before we go through our fourth quarter results, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on 2023 and outline our priorities for the upcoming year. Despite Hilltop's profitability for the year being hampered by a historically challenging mortgage market, the outstanding performance of our employees combined with our diversified business model, allowed the company to approve across a variety of areas. In 2023, we grew our earnings per share, dividends per share and book value per share, while also strengthening our liquidity and funding positions. Additionally, we enhanced our future earnings potential by improving our cost structure and taking advantage of hiring opportunities given dislocation across the financial services industry. From a balance standpoint, we generated average loan growth of 1% despite muted customer demand, a decline in funding -- deposit funding and tightening of credit standards. This growth is a testament to our long-term relationship banking approach and our ability to identify and capitalize on viable lending opportunities as competitors with strained balance sheets have pulled back. Conversely, our average deposit balances experienced a 7% decline. This trend was initially spurred by the bank failures that occurred in the first half of the year, and was further exacerbated by the intense competition around deposits that persisted throughout the remainder of the year. Our conservative approach to growth allowed us to withstand the decline in deposits without having to significantly rely on expensive wholesale funding options, which resulted in improved net interest income year-over-year. From an expense standpoint, our strategic focus on managing fixed costs, particularly in our mortgage operations, along with an enterprise-wide lens on cost management resulted in a meaningful reduction in noninterest expenses year-over-year. From a credit standpoint, this year, we proactively increased our allowance for loan losses to reflect broader industry challenges and credit migration in certain portfolios, particularly CRE office. Our ongoing monitoring in this area remains a priority. As we enter 2024, our primary focus at the bank remains on prudent risk management and maintaining strong capital and liquidity in order to navigate the fluctuating economic landscape and take advantage of organic and inorganic growth opportunities. Concurrently, we are committed to steering our mortgage business and a trajectory towards profitability, recognizing the mortgage cycle has endured for a longer than anticipated. Additionally, we are strategically positioning our business in Hilltop Securities to capitalize on growth opportunities and adapt to a potentially lower rate environment anticipated in the latter half of the year. Moving to the fourth quarter. Hilltop reported net income of $29 million or $0.44 per diluted share. Return on average assets for the period was 75 basis points and return on average equity was 5.5%. During the quarter, PlainsCapital Bank generated $48 million of pretax income on $13.3 billion of assets, representing a return on average assets of 1.1%. Average loans at the bank declined slightly from the third quarter as normal seasonality occurred in National Warehouse Lending and balances in our single-family residential portfolio declined. The pipeline for CRE lending remains challenged, and we expect that to continue into the new year as clients hold off on projects due to elevated rates and higher equity requirements. Our average balances -- our average deposit balance of $11.1 billion declined 1% during the period, primarily due to management of excess liquidity and the ability to run off more expensive broker deposits. In the quarter, we returned $200 million of suite deposits back to Hilltop Securities and had $200 million of broker deposits run off. In the fourth quarter, the bank did experience some negative migration and asset quality, primarily from a single credit. Nonperforming loans increased to 0.8% and as a result of a $33 million Texas hotel loan being placed on nonaccrual. Overall, asset quality continues to be stable outside of this one notable credit as criticized loans were flat and net charge-offs were less than $1 million in the quarter. Moving to PrimeLending. The fourth quarter of 2023 was significantly impacted by continued low inventory, seasonality, escalating home prices and notably higher interest rates. Which collectively resulted in the lowest affordability for homebuyers in over two decades and a stark year-over-year decrease in refinance activity. In response to these ongoing challenges, PrimeLending continue to take proactive measures to streamline its operations and lower fixed and variable expenses. These measures include reducing non-sales head count and underperforming loan originators as well as closing unprofitable locations. As a result, PrimeLending's pretax loss for the fourth quarter 2023 strength relative to the prior year period. Despite the exceptionally tough business environment, PrimeLending maintained its industry-leading customer satisfaction rating and continue to be recognized as one of the top places to work. These achievements speak volumes about our team's resilience and commitment. Looking forward, we believe the measures already taken to reduce our cost base, combined with improved pricing, utilization of technology to reduce head count dependency and our success in hiring skilled loan originators from peers with less stability, place prime lending in a strong position for the eventual recovery of the housing and mortgage markets. In the fourth quarter, HilltopSecurities realized pretax income of $20 million on net revenues of $120 million, marking a 12% increase over the prior year. This growth was driven mainly by the mortgage trading business and suite products within Wealth Management. Speaking to the business lines at HilltopSecurities. Public Finance Services experienced a 5% decrease in net revenues compared to a strong fourth quarter last year. Municipal advisory fee revenues declined, while underwriting revenues increased slightly. Revenues from the public finance spoke products also improved due to increased fees on our cash pool products. We remain optimistic about our public finance business, particularly with the anticipated need for increased infrastructure spending and our recent opportunistic hiring from large banks that have decided to exit the municipal business. Our structured finance net revenues experienced a significant rise mainly due to our mortgage-related businesses. While this business remains volatile, our dominant position in the taxable housing space and successful activity in key markets like Florida contributed meaningfully in the fourth quarter. In Wealth Management, net revenues improved modestly compared to last year's fourth quarter. The Federal Reserve rate hikes positively impacted our FDIC sweep revenues. We continue to focus on recruiting quality advisers and enhancing our product offerings in both the firm and independent brokerage channels. Finally, for HilltopSecurities, our fixed income business, while facing some challenges, showed resilience, and we're enthusiastic about the growth prospects of the overall group as rates stabilize and our new small business loan effort, takes off. As we move into 2024, our goal is to further enhance our sales distribution capabilities while upholding our strong culture and risk management practices. Moving to Page 4. Hilltop maintains robust capital levels with a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 19.3% and our tangible book value per share increased from year-end 2022 by $1.17 to $28.35. Over the past 5 years, our tangible book value per share has compounded at 10% annually, while our dividend per share has compounded at 19% annually. Before I pass the presentation over to Will to discuss our financial results, I'd like to take a moment to discuss some important changes happening at the bank that we disclosed in the fourth quarter. Jerry Shafner, the President and CEO of PlainsCapital Bank will be retiring on May 1. Jerry has been a cornerstone of our success since PlainsCapital's founding in 1988, and his retirement marks the end of an era. His leadership and dedication over a stellar 42-year career have been nothing short of transformative. I'd like to thank him for his incredible contributions to our company. You are a great partner and a dear friend. In line with this transition, I am honored to take on the role of CEO at PlainsCapital Bank, in addition to my current responsibilities at Hilltop. This step is part of a carefully crafted succession plan, ensuring continuity and stability for our organization. Further, this step is made possible due to the existing depth and strength of our bank leadership team. Notably, in the fourth quarter, Brian Heflin was promoted to President of PlainsCapital Bank, and Pete Villarrea was promoted to Chief Operating Officer of PlainsCapital Bank. Their experience and proven leadership are invaluable assets to our bank. We are excited about this new chapter and the opportunities it brings. With a solid team in place, we are poised for continued growth and success. And we remain committed to our mission of serving our customers, employees, communities and shareholders with unwavering dedication and a long-term focus. Thank you. And now I will turn it over to Will to discuss our financial results in more detail.\nWill Furr: Thank you, Jeremy. I'll start on Page 5. As Jeremy discussed, for the fourth quarter of 2023, Hilltop reported consolidated income attributable to common stockholders of $29 million, equating to $0.44 per diluted share. This quarter's results highlight the benefits of our diversified model. As HilltopSecurities generated $14 million of sweep revenue, which is represented within their Wells management business line. In structured finance posted solid revenue contribution in the period. Somewhat offsetting these positive activities during the fourth quarter, prime lending and the broader mortgage industry continue to struggle as overall market inventory remains very low, assuring both origination volumes and margins in the business. The bank remained stable as NIM pressures persist and somewhat mitigated by lower than expected credit cost and a modest decline in noninterest expense quarter-over-quarter. Turning to Page 6. For the full year of 2023, Hilltop reported consolidated income attributable to common stockholders of $110 million, equating to $1.69 per diluted share. While net income declined 3% versus the prior year, overall diluted EPS did improve by 5%, driven by lower full year average shares. Turning to Page 7. Hilltop's allowance for credit losses increased during the quarter by $600,000 to $111.4 million. The macroeconomic outlook improved in the fourth quarter, which somewhat offset the impacts of collective portfolio changes and an increase in specific reserves. Allowance for credit losses of $111 million, yield an ACL to total loans HFI ratio of 1.38% as of December 31, 2023. I will address additional credit trends later in this presentation. As we've seen over time, ACL can be volatile as it is impacted by economic assumptions as well as changes in the mix and makeup of the credit portfolio. We continue to believe that the allowance for credit losses could be volatile and the future changes in the allowance will be driven by net loan growth in the portfolio, credit migration trends and changes to the macroeconomic outlook over time. Given the current uncertainties regarding inflation, interest rates, GDP growth and unemployment, we expect volatility in the ACL could be heightened over the coming quarters. Turning to Page 8. As provided in previous quarters, this slide highlights our CRE portfolio and the allowance distribution across some of the key loan segments. December 31, the CRE portfolio totaled approximately $3.3 billion, which we segregate in the owner and nonowner occupied or investor real estate. Internally, we view owner-occupied real estate, more like C&I lending. As for the most part, repayment is driven by the operating business that owns the real estate. Nonowner-occupied real estate makes up 57% of the CRE book. And as is noted in the upper right-hand chart is diversified across multiple income-producing property types. In the bottom table, we provide a breakout of nonowner-occupied office and retail within the portfolio to highlight the differentiation in ACL coverage by loan segment type. Our view to date is that the office and retail markets across our footprint represent the highest exposure to both recession, absorption and valuation risk in the portfolio. As you can see, those loan segments maintain larger ACL coverage ratios than other nonowner-occupied real estate products. You should note during the fourth quarter, the bank downgraded one large hotel credit totaling approximately $33 million of outstanding balance to nonaccrual as the property's cash flows are not currently sufficient to meet the cash demands for the property. This downgrade constitutes 89% of the increase in NPAs during the quarter. Further, while the downgrade did not result in a significant increase or decrease to the ACL, we have requested new appraisals and we'll update the status of this loan during our first quarter call. While this credit is clearly a focus for us, we're currently monitoring the entire portfolio very closely. And while credit losses have not normalized to more historical levels to date, we do expect that the ongoing cash flow challenges facing existing and new projects as seen in the broader commercial real estate industry, driven by higher interest rates and ongoing inflation could lead to further credit migration over time. Turning to Page 9. Net interest income in the fourth quarter equated to $111 million, including $1.2 million of purchase accounting accretion. Versus the prior year fourth quarter, net interest income decreased by $12 million or 10%, driven primarily by higher yields on deposits. As we expected, net interest margin declined versus the third quarter of 2023. Falling by 6 basis points to 296 basis points. Our current outlook reflects a scenario where dock Fed funds remained stable for the majority of 2024 and with only one rate reduction contemplated in the fourth quarter. Additional rate decreases will pressure net interest income downward. Turning to Page 10. We have more discussion topics related to NII. In the upper left table, we provide detail on our latest sensitivity analysis for NII related to parallel and instantaneous shocks and interest rates. As is noted in the chart, Hilltop remains approximately 6% asset-sensitive in the down 100 scenario. Over the past few years, we've reduced our asset sensitivity by approximately 50% from 12% to 6%. Going forward, the most significant drivers of NII stability will be driven by our ability to manage the down rate deposit betas, which we are currently modeling at 50% and deposit mix shifts noninterest-bearing into interest-bearing deposit products, which we expect will continue through the first half of the year. To help mitigate some exposure to falling rates, we have begun investing approximately 50% of the cash flows from our securities portfolio and the securities that we believe maintain a better repayment exposure. In addition, we are beginning to retain additional hybrid mortgage loans on the balance sheet. These loans will generally maintain shorter fixed rate periods including 3 and 5 years. While loan retention could be volatile on a monthly basis, we expect to retain on average, $10 million per month throughout 2024. With that said, given our expectation that deposit rates remain elevated, and deposit competition will remain intense. We do expect that NII will be down versus 2023 by 3% to 7% in 2024. Turning to Page 11. In the chart, we highlight the approximately $7.6 billion of available liquidity sources that Hilltop maintained as of December 31. While we consider the Federal Reserve's discount window to be a source of liquidity, we do not plan to leverage that program under our internal liquidity modeling efforts. And as such, it's noted below our other collateralized borrowing sources. Further, the comparable liquidity sources as of December 31, 2022, equated to just over $7 billion and increased steadily throughout the prior quarters of the year. As is shown in the chart, at December 31, Hilltop maintained $1.6 billion of excess reserves at the Federal Reserve. Additionally, in the bottom left chart, we provide detail on the pace of the deposit beta changes to date, noting that our current through-the-cycle beta for interest-bearing deposits of 65%. We currently expect that through the cycle interest-bearing deposit betas will be within the range of 60% to 70%, likely drifting marginally higher over the coming two quarters. Turning to Page 12. Fourth quarter average total deposits are approximately $11.1 billion, remaining largely stable versus the third quarter of 2023. On an ending balance basis, deposits decreased by $40 million from the prior quarter, whereby growth in bank client deposits was offset by the decline in broker-dealer sweep and broker deposits build at PlainsCapital. During the quarter, the bank returned $200 million of sweep deposits and $200 million of brokered deposits in an effort to reduce overall excess cash levels at the Federal Reserve. Over the coming year, we expect that excess deposits at the Federal Reserve will decline to between $300 million and $750 million. As a result of our ongoing pricing efforts, interest-bearing deposit costs rose to 340 basis points, an increase of 17 basis points from the prior quarter. It is our expectation and interest-bearing deposit costs will continue to move higher in the first two quarters of 2024 and then stabilize until the Federal Reserve changes the Fed funds target. As it relates to deposit balances and costs, we remain focused on balancing our competitive position with our long-term customer relationships while we continue to prudently manage net interest income over time. However, the current environment remains very challenging. And as noted earlier, we expect that the intensity of competition for deposits will remain resulting in lower overall balances and continued pressure on yields over the coming quarters. I'm turning to Page 13. Total noninterest income for the fourth quarter of 2023 equated to $179 million. Fourth quarter mortgage-related income and fees decreased by $2 million versus the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by the ongoing challenges in mortgage banking, whereby the combination of higher interest rates, home price inflation, limited housing supply and ongoing overcapacity in terms of mortgage originators across the U.S. has driven volumes and margins materially lower. Further, versus the prior year fourth quarter, purchase mortgage volumes decreased by $198 million or 10% and refinance volumes increased substantially from prior year levels to $1.2 billion. Block volumes were substantially impacted by certain states providing additional state funding to support their state housing authorities and down payment assistance programs. As we've noted in the past, it's important to recognize that both the fixed income services and structured finance businesses at HilltopSecurities can be volatile from period-to-period as they are impacted by interest rates, overall market liquidity and production trends. I'm turning to Page 14. Noninterest expenses decreased from the same period in the prior year by $2.6 million to $251 million. Driving the modest reduction versus the prior year were fixed expense reductions at PrimeLending. As they continue to focus on the work of resizing our mortgage operations to support the current environment. These reductions were somewhat offset by growth in software and computing expenses and higher FDIC assessment fees. Looking forward, we expect expenses other than variable compensation to remain relatively stable between $185 million and $190 million per quarter as the ongoing focused efforts related to streamlining our operations and improving productivity continue to support lower head count and improved throughput across our franchise, helping to offset the ongoing inflationary pressures that persist in the market. Moving to Page 15. Fourth quarter average HFI loans equated to $7.9 billion. On a period ending basis, HFI loans declined versus the third quarter of 2023 by $124 million driven by declines in mortgage warehouse lending of $81 million and the declines in the 1-4 family mortgage portfolio, which equated to $23 million. We expect that loan growth will remain challenged in 2024, as 1-4 family retention levels are expected to remain modest and commercial lending activity continue to remain highly competitive with the pace of new transactions remaining slower than in prior years. Currently, we are expecting full year average bank loan growth of 0% to 2% during 2024, excluding mortgage warehouse lending and any retained mortgages from prime lending. Turning to Page 16. Credit losses have remained steady as net charge-offs for the fourth quarter equated to $674,000. For the full year of 2023, net charge-offs equated to $2.4 million or 3 basis points of ending HFI loans. Further, the graph on the upper right highlights that NPA levels increased by approximately $37 million during the fourth quarter, largely driven by the hotel credit that I reviewed earlier in my comments. Despite the increase in NPAs, our criticized loan levels as a percentage of bank loans were relatively stable versus the third quarter of 2023. We are monitoring our loans and borrowers closely as higher interest rates, potentially lower utilization rates in certain segments of commercial real estate and an expected slowdown in economic activity could have a negative impact on our clients in our portfolio. As is shown on the graph at the bottom right of the page, the allowance for credit loss coverage at the bank ended the year at 1.44%, including mortgage warehouse lending. Moving to Page 17. As we move into 2024, there continues to be a lot of uncertainty in the market regarding interest rates, inflation and the overall health of the economy. That said, we have provided our current outlook metrics for the coming year. As we've noted in the past, we are pleased with the work that our team has delivered to position our company for times like these. And our teammates across our franchise remain focused on delivering great customer service to our clients, attracting new customers to our franchise, supporting the communities where we serve, maintaining a moderate risk profile and delivering long-term stockholder value. Current outlook for 2024 reflects our current assessment of the economy and markets where we participate. Further, as the market changes and we adjust our business to respond, we will provide updates to our outlook on our future quarterly calls. Operator, that concludes our prepared comments, and we'll turn the call back to you for the Q&A section of the call.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Thomas Wendler at Stephens Inc.\nThomas Wendler: It looks like you're still targeting some asset sensitivity reduction. Can you give us an idea on the goals there? How close to neutral are you guys trying to move?\nWill Furr: I think over the next -- this is Will. Over the next year, we'd like to move that to closer to 3%.\nThomas Wendler: And then just moving over to mortgage. I'm a bit surprised to see the gain on sale margins decrease in 4Q. Can you give us any color there?\nWill Furr: What we've seen, again, as I noted in my comments, is that customers have a propensity at this point to want to buy down the rate. So we're seeing more customers paying higher origination fees and other fees versus necessarily is rolling through our gain on sale. Overall, total revenue for the loan remains reasonably stable. But the mix between those two continues to shift towards origination fees versus gain on sale as I noted, we do expect annual sales will rebound slowly over time. But again, it's -- we expect that to occur slowly throughout '24 and into '25.\nThomas Wendler: If I can just sneak one more in. Can you give us an idea of the impact, like increased levels of rate cuts could have on mortgage in 2024. I think you guys have one cut kind of factored into your modeling. Can you give us an idea of how a couple of additional cuts might impact mortgage?\nWill Furr: I think our view is rates lower would necessarily be positive. But again, given where the overall mortgage industry is as it relates to customer mortgage loan rates, we believe that a large percentage of customers have got mortgages that currently yield a rate below 6%. Given that, it will take us what we believe to be a substantial number of cuts to really project forward a substantial return to the refinance business. That said, we believe lower rates would help necessarily drive some of the purchase business. I would say our view is that the largest constraint in the mortgage business right now, certainly that we see as overall inventory levels and the availability of housing across the markets where we participate. And so while rates are important and certainly, affordability matters, the overall availability of homes and again, those inventory levels, we would view as the largest constraint.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Tim Mitchell at Raymond James.\nTim Mitchell: So to start on the hotel credit that moved to nonperforming this quarter. Could you just give some more color on what happened with that property? And then are you looking to move it out of the bank or what potential loss content could be in there?\nWill Furr: Well, I'll try to address those in reverse order from a loss content perspective. As I noted in my comments, we've requested two additional and new appraisals. We'll evaluate those when that information becomes available, but we believe the current quarter's results or current year results reflect the lost content currently in that loan. The short story is the cash flows and the pro formas that we've evaluated -- we've been evaluating really more -- our mortgage business very closely through our overall hotel portfolio, I should say, closely since COVID, the cash flows simply haven't come back for this particular property as quickly and as robustly as we would have expected as the operator would have expected. And as a result, the cash flow challenges, we feel like it was prudent and appropriate to move to nonaccrual in this period.\nTim Mitchell: Perfect. And then just moving to net interest margin. kind of took a step down this quarter. When do you think that could trough and inflect in '24? And how might rate cuts play into that?\nWill Furr: Yes. So we would expect net interest margin to trend modestly lower from current levels. I'll give you the reported statistics. So for the quarter, we ended 2.96%. For December, however, we were at 2.92%. So that gives you some sense that there's headwinds kind of right here in the immediate future. That said, we expect it would trough in the second quarter. And again, depending on where the Fed moves and how quickly they move could start to move higher as soon as the third and fourth quarter. But again, we would expect it to trough in the second quarter.\nTim Mitchell: Awesome. And then just one last one for me. You guys bought back about $5 million of stock this quarter and you announced a new program, I think, $75 million because do you think of 4Q levels are kind of a good run rate through '24? Or how you're thinking about buybacks?\nJeremy Ford: I think that we have a $75 million share repurchase authorization that we just put in place. So I'd kind of look at that as the target for this year, but we're going to be evaluating as we do every quarter where our stock is trading.\nOperator: And currently, there are no further questions on the line. So at that point, we'll conclude today's call. Thank you all very much for attending. This now concludes the conference. You may now disconnect your lines.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor. For more information see our T&C."

Further information is contained within the press release, which we encourage you to review. Additionally, management would refer to non-GAAP measurements, which are intended to supplement, but not substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The press release available on the website contains financial and/or other quantitative information to be discussed today as well as reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Mark Hardwick, Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Hardwick, you may begin.\nMark Hardwick: Good morning, and welcome to the First Merchants' full year 2023 conference call. Thanks for the introduction and for covering the forward-looking statement on Page 2. We released our earnings today at approximately 8:00 AM Eastern and you can access today's slides by following the link on the third page of our earnings release. On Page 3 of our slides, you will see today's presenters and our bios to include Mike -- our President, Mike Stewart; Chief Credit Officer, John Martin; and Chief Financial Officer, Michele Kawiecki. On Page 4, we have a few highlights of the year to include final total assets of $18.3 billion, $12.5 billion of total loans, $14.8 billion of total deposits, and $7.3 billion of assets under advisement. On Slide 5, if you look at the bullet points under our fourth quarter results, we grew loans during the quarter by 6.6% annualized with a new and renewed loan yield of 8.01%. We also increased deposits by 4.8% during the same period and we reported Q4 2023 EPS of $0.71 per share, or $0.81 -- or $0.87 when adjusted for several one-time expense items incurred during the quarter. Those items include $12.7 million in one-time charges that include the FDIC special assessment due to several bank failures in March of '23, severance expense related to a voluntary early retirement incentive plan that we offered to employees in the fourth quarter of 2023, and the write-off of a lease agreement due to our Indianapolis regional headquarter move. Moving down to the bottom half of the page, you will see year-to-date bullet points. We've delivered net income of $221.9 million and produced $3.73 of earnings per share for the year when adjusted for the same one-time expenditures that EPS totaled $3.8 -- $3.89. During a year where safety and soundness became the highest priority of stakeholders, we effectively repositioned our balance sheet to prioritize cash, liquidity and capital. The company's liquidity position improved by $585 million as cash increased $300 million and borrowings declined $285 million. Our tangible common equity increased by $222 million, during the year, driving our TCE ratio up from 7.37% one year ago to 8.44% at year-end. We maintain strong credit quality and top decile allowance for loan losses totaling 1.64%. I'm proud of our team of driven, collaborative and high character employees for rising to the call to deliver an enhanced and resilient balance sheet while also adding high quality risk aware loans at a clip of just over 5%, and for delivering net deposit growth of 3% for the year. Before handing over the presentation, I would just like to thank our 2,000 plus colleagues for tackling a turbulent 2023 head on and for delivering top quartile results that we can all be proud of. Mike?\nMichael Stewart: Yeah. Thank you, Mark, and good morning to all. Our business strategy that is outlined on Slide 6 remains unchanged and is a reminder that the financial results we deliver represent the durability of our business model within the primary markets of Indiana, Michigan and Ohio. We serve diverse locations in both stable rural markets and in growing metro markets. We are a commercially focused organization across all these business segments and collectively the First Merchants team is actively engaged in all of our communities, delivering the solutions listed on this page. Throughout 2023, we have remained committed to our business strategy of organic growth of loans, deposits and fee income, attracting, retaining and building our team investing in technology platforms that enhance the client experience and delivering top-tier financial metrics. Let's turn to Slide 7. This slide validates our ability to deliver organic growth of both loans and deposits. The annualized total loan growth for the fourth quarter was 6.6%, highlighted by the 8% growth in commercial portfolio. During our last quarter call, I noted the strong commercial pipeline and that pipeline did materialize from our C&I focused regional bankers and from our investment real estate team. John has more detail to share around the portfolio mix and his detailed analysis show that nearly 70% of our total loan growth of 2023 comes from the commercial segment, which is consistent with our global portfolio mix of 75% commercial and the rest consumer. Within the consumer portfolio, we have residential mortgage, HELOC, installment and private banking relationships, and during the fourth quarter that portfolio grew at a 2.7% annualized rate. So again, for 2023, the total loan portfolio grew at 5.1%. Mid to high-single digit loan growth is the expectation moving forward in the 2024. While the commercial loan pipeline ended the year lower than the third quarter, the current pipeline is sufficient to achieve our expected organic growth goals. As you know, loan growth can be choppy throughout any given period. The quarterly commercial loan growth trends have gained momentum since April, post the Silicon Valley bank crisis. We were purposeful in how we navigated our bank through those uncertain times and a loan portfolio sell and liquidity management are some examples, but the commercial loan growth improved each quarter since March with the fourth quarter at its high watermark for the year. The overall economic environment in the Midwest, inclusive of the competitive landscape, affirms my expectation of mid to high-single digit loan growth with improving loan yields. Mark highlighted that our new loan yields exceeded 8% during the quarter, which is an increase of 13 basis points from the prior, and Michele has more detail to share on the positive trends in loan yields and loan types. The quarter saw total deposits growing 4.8% annualized and 3.1% for the full year 2023. The consumer deposit portfolio showed continued strong growth at over 11% annualized. This growth is inclusive of both the branch network and our private banking team. The consumer team continues to deliver consistent low-cost depository base. The commercial deposit growth during the quarter was also strong. This was the only quarter throughout 2023 that commercial deposits grew. But both teams are focused on relationship banking and building market share and again, this page demonstrates that the fourth quarter delivered balance sheet growth. As Mark stated in the press release, our bank's liquidity improved throughout 2023. We have a strong capital position. Our team built a resilient balance sheet. So we enter 2024 positioned for continued growth. Our team is positioned for that growth and our underwriting remains supportive, consistent and disciplined. So I'll turn the call over to Michele to review in more detail the composition of our balance sheet and the drivers of our income statement. Michele?\nMichele Kawiecki: Slide 8 covers (ph) our fourth quarter results. On line one you will see we grew assets by $313 million during the quarter, representing a very productive quarter for the company. $203 million was from loans which Mike just covered, and $98 million was an increase in investments reflecting an increase in value of available-for-sale securities. Deposits on line four grew $175 million leading to strong equity growth of $155 million, which you can see on line five. Pre-tax pre-provision earnings, when adjusted for the one-time charges Mark described of $12.7 million, totaled $61.1 million for the quarter. Adjusted pre-tax pre-provision return on assets was 1.33% and adjusted pre-tax pre-provision return on equity was 11.47%, all of which continue to reflect strong profitability metrics. Tangible book value per share increased 11.7% from last quarter, totaling $25.06 at year end. Slide 9 shows the year-to-date results. The variances on balance sheet lines one through five display the work the team has done in shifting the earning asset mix through the year, which resulted in a robust increase in yield on earning assets of 1.46% year-over-year. Year-to-date, pre-tax pre-provision earnings, excluding the one-time charges, I mentioned previously, totaled $275.4 million. Adjusted pre-tax pre-provision return on assets was 1.51% and adjusted pre-tax pre-provision return on equity was 12.95%. Tangible book value per share increased $3.61, or 17% over prior year reflecting strong year-to-date earnings. Excluding the noise from mark-to-market adjustments on the securities, the company has experienced tangible book value growth every year for the last 10 years, and we are pleased to deliver another year of growth in 2023. A graph of this is included on Slide 23. Details of our investment portfolio are disclosed on Slide 10. We sold $43 million in bonds this quarter, resulting in a loss of $2.3 million. We have sold nearly $400 million in bonds throughout the year. Total cash flow generated from the bond portfolio in 2023, including sales, principal paydowns and interest, totaled approximately $660 million, creating liquidity to put to work in a loan portfolio, pay down higher rate wholesale funding and to ensure we have a solid cash position. Expected cash flows from scheduled principal and interest payments and bond maturities in 2024 totals $282 million. Slide 11 shows some details on our loan portfolio. The total loan portfolio yield continues to increase, climbing 13 basis points to 6.71% from 6.58% last quarter. You will see the delineation of our portfolio between fixed versus variable on the bottom right. Two-thirds of our loan portfolio is variable rate and half of the portfolio reprices within three months. That structure has allowed us to increase our interest income very quickly in response to the rising rate environment over the last two years and build capital. As I mentioned last quarter, we have $900,000 of fixed rate loans repricing during 2024 with a weighted average maturity rate of approximately 4.7%, which will provide some incremental interest income given new loans are repricing at 8.01% currently. The allowance for credit losses on Slide 12 declined just slightly from 1.67% to 1.64% of total loans due to net charge-offs incurred during the quarter of $3.1 million, which John will provide details on in his remarks. We recorded $2.3 million of provision for credit losses on loans, which was offset by a reduction of reserves for unfunded commitments of $800,000 due to the decline in unfunded commitment balances. The result was net provision expense of $1.5 million recognized in the income statement. Note that we have $23.2 million of remaining fair value marks on acquired loans. Our coverage ratio, including those marks is 1.82%, which provides exceptional coverage if credit losses were to materialize. Slide 13 shows details of our deposit portfolio. We continue to have a strong core deposit base with 39% of deposits yielding 5 basis points or less, with a low uninsured deposit percentage and a low average account balance reflecting a diverse deposit franchise. Our non-interest bearing deposits were 16.9% of total deposits at the end of the quarter, which was down very modestly from 17.4% in the prior quarter. Our total cost of deposits increased 26 basis points to 2.58% this quarter showing signs of slowing compared to last quarter. Although, we expect the cost of deposits to continue to increase somewhat over the next quarter or two, we expect the pace will be even slower than what we've experienced this quarter. We were pleased to be able to grow deposits during the year by 3.1% given deposits across the industry declined meaningfully in 2023. That growth was achieved while improving funding mix. We reduced brokered deposits and wholesale funding during the year and grew consumer and commercial deposits through customer acquisition and gaining a larger share of wallet. On Slide 14, net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis of $135.9 million declined $3.4 million from prior quarter. Earning asset yields increased 9 basis points this quarter as shown on line five, and was offset by the increase in funding costs on line six, reflecting stated net interest margin on line seven of 3.16%, a decline of 13 basis points from prior quarter. Next, Slide 15 shows the details of non-interest income. Overall, non-interest income decreased by $1.4 million on a linked quarter basis. As noted on the highlights on the slide, there were some non-customer related items impacting non-interest income this quarter, which included a $1.5 million BOLI gain, a $2.3 million loss on available-for-sale securities and a $1 million write-down of CRA investments. Customer-related items declined a modest $800,000, which reflected a $1.4 million decline on the sale of mortgage loans, offset by an increase in fiduciary and wealth management fees. Moving to Slide 16, non-interest expense for the quarter totaled $108.1 million and as previously mentioned, included $12.7 million in one-time charges. Core non-interest expense was in line with expectations and totaled $95.4 million, an increase of $1.6 million over last quarter, driven primarily by seasonal incentive accruals. Our adjusted core efficiency ratio shown at the top right continues to be low, coming in at 55.56% for the quarter and 53.31% year-to-date. Slide 17 shows our capital ratios. Our strong earnings this quarter drove capital expansion in all ratios. The significant growth you see on the top chart in the tangible common equity ratio reflects solid earnings and recapture of unrealized losses in AOCI. We are very pleased with the strength of our balance sheet and strong earnings reflecting a successful year amid real disruption in the industry. That concludes my remarks, and I will now turn it over to Chief Credit Officer, John Martin to discuss asset quality.\nJohn Martin: Thanks, Michele, and good morning. My remarks start on Slide 18. I'll highlight the loan portfolio, touch on the updated insight slide, review asset quality and the non-performing asset roll forward before turning the call back over to Mark. Turning to Slide 18, on line two, where I highlight the various portfolio segments, commercial industrial loans, originated by our regional and middle market banking teams, grew the portfolio by $214 million. We came off a strong backlog in the third quarter as Mike mentioned, with good pull through. Investment real estate, on line five, also had good movement in the quarter from both new originations and with properties moving out of the construction portfolio and to mini-perm. As the sponsor portfolio seasons, we continue to see exits from the portfolio as firms reach their time horizon, resulting in periodic exits and paydowns. As mentioned on prior calls, higher interest rates have driven additional capital investment into platform companies in order to meet our underwriting and stress criteria. Turning to Slide 19, I've updated the portfolio insights slide to provide additional transparency. In the commercial space, the C&I classification includes sponsor finance as well as owner occupied CRE associated with the business. Our C&I portfolio has a 20% concentration in manufacturing. Our current line utilization has remained fairly consistent at around 41% with line commitments increasing roughly $89 million for the quarter. We participate in roughly $740 million of shared national credits across various industries. These are generally relationships where we have access to management and revenue opportunities beyond the credit exposure. In the sponsor finance portfolio, I've highlighted key credit portfolio metrics. There are 86 platform companies with 53 active sponsors in an assortment of industries, roughly 65% have a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.5 times based on September information. This portfolio consists of single bank deals for platform companies and private equity firms as opposed to large, widely syndicated leverage loans. We review the individual relationships quarterly for changes in borrower condition, including leverage and cash flow coverage. Turning to Slide 20. We continue to provide the breakout of our non-owner occupied commercial real estate portfolio with additional detail around our office exposure. Office exposure is broken out on the bottom half of the chart and represents 2% of total loans, slightly down from last quarter, with the highest concentration outside of general office in medical. I've added a chart to the bottom right with office portfolio maturities, refinanced risk appears to be low with $18 million, or 7% of total office loans maturing within the next year. The office portfolio is well diversified by tenant type and geographic mix. We continue to periodically review our larger office exposure and view the exposure as reasonably mitigated through a combination of loan-to-value, guarantors, tenant mix and other considerations. On Slide 21, I've highlighted our asset quality trends and current position, NPAS and 90 days past due loans decreased $1.1 million to 47 basis points of loans and ORE. We continue to experience consistent portfolio performance despite higher rates with relatively consistent levels of classifieds at 1.94% of loans. We've moved past last quarter's last charge-offs with $3.1 million of net charge-offs or 10 basis points of average annualized -- annualized average loans for the quarter. Then moving on to Slide 22, where I've again rolled forward the migration of non-performing loans, charge-offs, ORE and 90 days past due. For the quarter, we added non-accrual loans, on line two, of $10.3 million, a reduction from payoffs or changes in accrual status of $6.1 million on line three, and a reduction from gross charge-offs of $3.7 million. Dropping down to line nine, we wrote down ORE by $1.1 million, which resulted in NPAS plus 90 days past due, ending at $58.6 million for the quarter. So to summarize, asset quality remains good, net charge-offs for the quarter were 10 basis points and for the year 21 basis points, and for the quarter the portfolio grew at a 6.6% annualized growth rate, and both criticized and classified loans remain in check with stable delinquency. I appreciate your attention, and I'll now turn the call back over to Mark Hardwick.\nMark Hardwick: Turning to Slide 23, I'm going to review a few of my favorite charts as they take a more long-term perspective. Look at our performance. On the top right, our 10-year earnings per share CAGR totaled 10.2%. And looking at both the growth and tangible book value per share and dividends paid during 2023, total book value return equaled 23% or if you prefer to look at tangible book value per share excluding AOCI, our total book value excluding AOCI return for the year equaled just over 15%. Slide 24 represents our total asset CAGR of 12.9% during the last 10 years and highlights meaningful acquisitions that have materially added to our demographic footprint that fuels our growth. Slide 25, I've made a few edits to include replacing the word digital transformation with continued investment in. During the last three years, we have delivered a new online account origination platform, enhancements to our commercial loan automation system, and we are just days and months away from completing four big enhancements. This week, we completed the rollout of our personal in branch account opening process, which reduces account opening times from an average of 45 minutes to less than 10 minutes while eliminating error rates by nearly 75%. It's also connected with our online account opening process that can be delivered seamlessly through either channel or both channels. We're also live or in beta with our new online and mobile platform for consumer -- customers and plan to be fully live with 160,000 customers by the end of February. The first half of 2024 also includes the completion of our new wire platform, our new online platform for commercial or treasury management customers, and upgrading the private wealth platform. I should also remind all of you that we have a handful of one-time expenses related to temporarily overlapping systems and customer service center augmentation to handle these upgrades. We expect a first quarter charge of approximately $3 million and a second quarter charge of approximately $2 million. Through these projects, we have truly streamlined and simplified the client experience, and we will continue to focus on modest, relevant enhancements in the future. Thanks for your attention and your investment in First Merchants. And at this time, we're happy to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question our first question comes from the line of Daniel Tamayo with Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nDaniel Tamayo: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Excuse me. Maybe Michele, just first on the margin and the NII outlook. I appreciate all the detail you gave on the funding side as well as the asset side repricing. And I apologize if I missed it. But did you have kind of a baseline assumption for how the NIM trends through 2024 and what NII might look like?\nMichele Kawiecki: Sure. Good morning. So for Q1, we do expect to see a bit more compression in 2024. Our December margin was 312. So that can give you a bit of a data point. And then I would also remind you that because we're so commercially oriented, margin is always seasonally low in Q1, simply due to day count. So just another item. But assuming a flat rate environment, we are expecting margin to stabilize in the quarters thereafter. Now, if there are rate cuts, our model tells us that for each 25 basis point rate cut, margin declines about 4 basis points. We're taking a very proactive approach in managing our deposit costs down in anticipation of the rate cuts, which could perhaps lessen that impact and a couple of other items. We'll be paying down about 40 million of sub debt at the end of this month that had a rate near 10%, which will offer some meaningful savings. We continue to sell bonds, which create some spread when we put that cash back to work and loans and higher cost funding. And the other thing that I'd mentioned too, is typically in a declining rate environment, we tend to see an opportunity for higher mortgage loan gain sales. So although we think that there are definitely some tail -- some headwinds when we have -- a declining rate environment, we think that there's some tailwinds as well.\nDaniel Tamayo: I appreciate all that detail. Is there kind of an all-in NII outlook? You obviously have an expectation for continued strong loan growth in the year. Just curious how you think NII might end up for the year.\nMichele Kawiecki: Yeah, I think in Q1, we will see some compression in net interest income, but then we're expecting stability and growth thereafter, particularly in the second half due to our expected growth.\nDaniel Tamayo: Okay. Terrific. And then lastly, just following up on your comment on mortgage banking, you've maybe not bottomed as low as some other banks, doing quite well, actually, last year. Just curious where you think that number could end up once rates start coming down. I mean, you're -- I think you were doing about 20 million a year during some pretty good times in 2020 and 2021. Do you think you'll be able to get above that given the investments you've made?\nMark Hardwick: Daniel, it's Mark Hardwick. I -- that's a good question. We-- we're really pleased by the enhancements we've made with the team post Level One. So we kind of doubled the size of the business before the downturn in rates. And when I say doubled our portfolio -- our -- First Merchants originations were almost identical to Level Ones. And so by putting the two organizations together, we feel like we've materially strengthened the outlook. And I do think it has a lot to do with rates. But I'm confident that we had potential and capacity in the core First Merchants franchise based on this change that we've had in our strategy around mortgage. So, yeah, I'm confident that if we have a decline in rates, that we should be able to exceed our historical performance, when you look at the two on a combined basis.\nDaniel Tamayo: Terrific. Thanks for all the color. I'll step back.\nOperator: Thank you.\nMichele Kawiecki: Thanks, Danny.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Damon DelMonte with KBW. Your line is now open.\nDamon DelMonte: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Hope you're all doing well today. Just wanted to start off with some questions on expenses. Michele, looking for a little bit more guidance here as we go into '24. Obviously there are some one-time items this quarter, but kind of what are you thinking about for a good core run rate?\nMichele Kawiecki: Yeah. Good morning, Damon. So this quarter, our core expense total when you back out those one-time costs was $95.4 million. So on a core basis, we expect the quarterly expense run rate to be flat to maybe up 2% on the high side in 2024 compared to this quarter. As Mark mentioned, we will incur some one-time charges on top of our core expense run rate in Q1 and Q2 due to the online banking conversion and our private wealth platform conversion of a few million dollars each quarter. But we will disclose that impact and make sure that that's transparent to you. But like I said, I think we're very focused on good expense management for 2024 and feel that -- strongly that we can achieve that.\nDamon DelMonte: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then on the fee income side, you had called out a few items. If you kind of net those three items together, you're probably closer to like a $28 million operating non-interest income result this quarter. I know there's some volatility around potential for mortgage banking income that we just spoke about. But as you look at your other drivers of fee income, how should we kind of look at the quarterly level going forward?\nMichele Kawiecki: Yeah. This quarter, I think, it's -- the total is a little light for a run rate in 2024. We're expecting it probably to average more around the 30 million to 31 million per quarter next year.\nDamon DelMonte: Got it. Okay. And then just lastly, obviously some good recapture on the AOCI, which boosted tangible book value and intangible common equity. I think the TC ratio ended around 8.5%. Just kind of wondering what your thoughts are on capital management and a buyback in particular.\nMark Hardwick: Yeah. Thanks, Damon. Yeah. We were really thrilled to see the return to that TC ratio over 8%. And it was the catalyst to paying down $40 million of our sub debt. We decided to tackle it first. We've got a remaining $25 million, which we're likely to pay down next quarter. And just feel good about managing the bank based on a TC and total risk-based capital level, primarily off of common equity. So thinking about that first, there may be a time, assuming that we have stabilization in rates where we have the -- as we continue to add capital through earnings, we have the capacity to be active in the market. At these prices, I'm inclined to do that, but we have not started that process.\nDamon DelMonte: Got it. Okay. That's all that I had. Thanks a lot. Appreciate the color and commentary.\nMark Hardwick: Great. Thanks, Damon.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy from Stephens. Your line is now open.\nTerry McEvoy: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nMark Hardwick: Good morning, Terry.\nTerry McEvoy: Hi. The $214 million of C&I regional banking loans caught my eye, and I think there was some mention for prepared remarks about pipelines being healthy kind of starting the quarter. Any specific industries, markets that contributed to the outside growth last quarter? And what are your outlooks kind of specifically for the C&I business, which is a big part of the portfolio?\nMichael Stewart: Yeah. Good question, Terry. It's Mike Stewart. You know, the muted growth that we saw the prior quarter was simply because a lot of the C&I transactions really hadn't closed at that point. So we ended the quarter with a really strong high pipeline that didn't materialize. I think John even pointed that out. And it really was through that whole region bank model, which is traditionally the commercial industrial space. And that's the space that I think that we still have good outlooks as we turn the year into 2024. Fully staffed in our marketplace, taking advantage of competitive disruption, strong economic factors, when you think about Michigan, Indiana, Ohio. So that's what's driving a stable pipeline of that. We saw some nice growth in the investment real estate portfolio, solid transactions. Some of it could be growth underneath construction draws, but more of its just the origination has been good in the asset classes that we are deploying in, in addition to some fully funded term loans that we focused on. So just a nice balance mixed across the Midwest here.\nJohn Martin: And Terry, I might just add, in terms of industry, it's pretty much across the board. I mean, we're a Midwest C&I bank or commercial bank, and when we pick up C&I, it's just what's in our footprint. It's not a vertical that we're in, any particular area. So it comes in kind of a broad base as to what it happens to be.\nTerry McEvoy: Thanks for that. And Michele, do you have the level of index deposits as we all attempt to potentially model out lower rates and how that could impact your funding costs?\nMichele Kawiecki: Yeah. We have $2.5 billion of deposits that are tied to an index that we'll be able to reprice along with rate cuts if those occur.\nTerry McEvoy: And then just a last question is kind of the expenses, early retirement, severance lease. Are those connected to kind of broader expense management actions to manage expenses in 2024? And I'm trying to think of the -- their real numbers and how do you think about the earnback on the, call it, $8.4 million?\nMark Hardwick: Yeah. The earnback is quick. It's less than a year. So we're really pleased with the way the voluntarily retirement played out. And as much as anything, just excited about the opportunity that it creates for hungry employees that are ready for the next stage of their career.\nTerry McEvoy: Great. Thanks again for taking my questions. Have a good day.\nMark Hardwick: Thanks, Terry.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next questions. Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Race with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nNathan Race: Yeah. Hi, everyone.\nMark Hardwick: Hi, Nathan.\nNathan Race: Good afternoon. Appreciate you taking the -- I jumped on a little late, but I think I heard kind of a mid-to-high single digit loan growth outlook for this year. And just curious how you guys are thinking about the opportunities to grow the core deposit franchise in 2024. Obviously, it was a difficult year to grow core deposits in '23. So just curious how you guys are thinking about those opportunities, particularly in light of some of the improvements or enhancements on the technology side of things.\nMark Hardwick: Yeah. I would just say that we feel great about our liquidity position, which is you saw us lead with that in the press release and early in the call, we talked about that $585 million change, $300 million of new cash, a reduction of borrowings of $285 million. And so I think it allows us to be smart around our deposit pricing, maybe a little more conservative than what we were in 2023. But I still think our expectations are always mid to low-single digit deposit growth. So if you think about 3%, 4%, is our target kind of year after year. If you think about normal environments, obviously COVID and all the stimulus kind of changed those things, but it does feel like we're starting to settle into a banking environment that feels more like it used to.\nNathan Race: Okay. Great. And just thinking about the size of the securities portfolio going forward, I appreciate the disclosure around how much cash flow you have coming off this year. Is the expectation that just the portfolio shrinks by that amount or -- and you are able to just redeploy that cash flow and incremental deposit growth into new loans, or do you guys see need to maybe grow the securities book to some extent?\nMichele Kawiecki: We're not planning to grow the securities book. We are planning to use that liquidity for loan growth.\nNathan Race: Okay. Great. And then just one last question on credit maybe for John. I think in the past we've talked about a normalized charge-off range between 15 basis points and 20 basis points. Is there anything that you're seeing on the horizon that would cause you to deviate from that kind of historical trajectory into this year and next? Obviously, nice improvement in most credit metrics here in the fourth quarter, but just any thoughts on that kind of historical range as we kind of enter a still somewhat uncertain environment this year?\nJohn Martin: Yeah. Well, no, I don't -- actually, I wait for the question of what the run rate on charge-offs, what I think it would be, and I think of it really between that 10 basis point to 20 basis point range, absent any individual name that might pop up and you go through and you continue your portfolio reviews and your analysis of individual credits. And that still seems like it's reasonable to me given the level of classified, the level of criticized to pencil in.\nNathan Race: Okay. Great. And obviously, you guys are still operating with a very healthy reserve as a percentage of loans and MPLs for that matter. Any thoughts on just kind of where the reserve maybe bottoms over the next year or two as a percentage of loans in terms of kind of how you guys need to provide for kind of that mid-to-high single digit loan growth outlook?\nMichele Kawiecki: Well, I mean, it'll be likely that we'll take some provision to cover at least our loan growth during the year. We'll have to look at the changes in the economic scenarios. Obviously, that'll play a part in that determination. It might still tick down a little bit. We're at 164 for a coverage ratio now. We'll just have to kind of see how the year plays out with whether we get a soft landing or we get a recession. I think that's going to make a big difference.\nNathan Race: Got it. Makes sense. And then just one last housekeeping question. Does the tax rate go back up to around 15% for the first quarter of next year or '24, excuse me?\nMichele Kawiecki: Yeah. Typically our effective tax rate is around 15% to 15.5%. So I think that's what you should expect in 2024.\nNathan Race: Okay. Great. I appreciate you guys answering the questions and all the color. Thank you.\nMichele Kawiecki: Thank you, Nate.\nMark Hardwick: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Martin with Janney. Your line is now open.\nBrian Martin: Hey. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just one for John or two. Just -- I joined late. Just -- John, did the -- did you talk about what the special mention credits did in the quarter? I know that you've got the classifieds in the deck. Just curious what the leading indicator there looks like. It sounds like everything is just very strong on the credit front. Just trying to look a little bit deeper at that.\nJohn Martin: Yeah. We don't have a slide -- sorry, Brian. My voice -- my speaker muted, getting waved down here. So, I don't have my -- we don't disclose our criticized assets within on the slides, but they've kind of trended with the classifieds and we're, from a commitment standpoint, pretty much flat for the quarter.\nBrian Martin: Okay. Yeah, that's help. I just want a direction just kind of how it's looking and it sounds pretty good. Just wanted to kind of confirm that.\nJohn Martin: Yeah.\nBrian Martin: And then maybe just one for Michele on the deposit repricing. Michele, that $2.5 billion, is that pretty immediate on the deposit repricing? I guess, I don't know what that was tied to index-wise, but assume it's pretty immediate.\nMichele Kawiecki: It is, yes.\nBrian Martin: Okay. I got you in that front. Okay. And then maybe just last too, just on the growth outlook, it still sounds very strong. And obviously the focus is on the organic side. I mean, do you guys view or see opportunities out there on the M&A side? I mean there's a lot on your plate, listening to the call and everything going on, but just trying to understand what the opportunities may be on the M&A side, I guess in '24 and beyond.\nMark Hardwick: Yeah. We continue to have communication with a handful of banks that we think would be great fits as part of our franchise. But I'm not sure the environment has really changed to make M&A really attractive yet. A reduction of interest rates helped some return of stock price has been helpful. And we're just going to continue to have conversations. And when sellers are ready and looking for partners, we'll -- hopefully it fits with all of the other initiatives that we have happening. Really pleased to get some of these tech projects behind us by mid-year, by June 30. And when we're in the middle of that kind of activity, there's just no way to really even think about M&A. So -- but the conversations are continuous and we continue to build relationships.\nBrian Martin: Yeah. It makes sense. I mean, organic focus is where you guys have been, and it's been doing a great job. And like you said, all these initiatives, you don't want to drop the ball on those and get those done. So -- and timing is not perfect just yet. So, okay. And then maybe last one for me, maybe for John or whomever, but just as you kind of look at the loan repricing this year, the renewals and the rate increases, I guess, have you taken a look at that portfolio? I guess, can you just give any commentary about how much risk you see in those loans? Repricing is from a credit risk, the renewals getting -- absorbing the stress of the higher rates, or you've done any type of color on that?\nJohn Martin: I missed kind of the first part. Are you talking about investment real estate specifically?\nBrian Martin: Not just in general, in the loan book, the repricing this year...\nJohn Martin: Yeah.\nBrian Martin: And the credit just being able to absorb the impact of higher rates as they reprice and just if you've kind of looked at that maybe on the chunkier credits.\nJohn Martin: So far, what I've seen across the portfolio is that customers have been able to either increase their prices previously and they've been able to absorb the changes in interest rates pretty well, quite frankly. You do see it in some -- in cases where the higher interest rates have led to slightly higher debt service or higher debt service. But there's been a series of maneuvers, either through increases of prices or reduction in expenses or something else in the income statement they've been able to compensate for. So, yeah, I mean, just see it -- you see it, but you've got good business owners there figuring it out.\nMark Hardwick: Yeah. And Michele mentioned we have 900 million at a rate of 4.7% that are fixed rates that will mature in '24. And when we look through those, we're optimistic about how that helps earnings versus feeling like somehow you move into a credit issue.\nBrian Martin: Yeah. I got you. Okay, well, thanks for taking the questions, and a nice finish to the year, guys.\nOperator: Thank you.\nMark Hardwick: Thanks, Brian.\nOperator: I'm currently showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Mark Hardwick for closing remarks.\nMark Hardwick: Thank you, Norma. Yeah, thanks, everyone, for your participation. We're -- we again really pleased with the year that we had, especially in light of some of the challenges that occurred throughout the industry, what people are referring to it as March Madness. And just -- it helped to validate this strength and the safety and soundness of our institution. And I think we end the year with a balance sheet that really is in an incredibly strong position that sets us up for success in the future. So again, we appreciate your investment. We thank you for your time and have a good rest of your day. Thanks.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor. For more information see our T&C."

Welcome to today's Colgate-Palmolive Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Now, for opening remarks, I'd like to turn this call over to Chief Investor Relations Officer and Executive Vice President, M&A, John Faucher.\nJohn Faucher: Thanks, Betsy. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter in full year 2023 earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher. Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the Q4 and full year 2023 earnings press release and related prepared materials and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2022 annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate's website for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in tables 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the Q4 2023 earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website. Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, and Stan Sutula, Chief Financial Officer. Noel will provide you with some thoughts on our Q4 and full year results and our 2024 outlook. We will then open it up for Q&A. Noel?\nNoel Wallace: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us to discuss our strong finish to a very good year in 2023 and our positive outlook for 2024. Over the past two years, we've been particularly focused on sustaining our strong organic sales growth while rebuilding our margins and improving our cash flow performance. We delivered on all three of those goals this year while still investing behind advertising to strengthen our brands and building and scaling capabilities to deliver future growth. 2023 marked our fifth consecutive year of organic sales growth either in line or ahead of our 3% to 5% long-term target range. We delivered balanced organic sales growth, growth in all six divisions, all four of our categories, and with improved balance between pricing and volume as we exited the year. Volume rounded to flat in the fourth quarter and was up for the quarter, excluding the impact of lower private label volumes at Hill\u2019s. Our market share momentum is improving behind strong innovation, higher levels of brand investment with a focus on improving the effectiveness of each dollar spent. We're also seeing the benefits of our digital transformation as our efforts with data analytics continue to proceed. Our commitment to revenue growth management and the strength of our funding the growth efforts combined with our global productivity initiative drove gross margin expansion, double-digit-based business operating profit growth, and high single-digit based business EPS growth. We delivered these results while increasing the investment in marketing and strategic capabilities and absorbing the headwinds from higher interest expense, pension and tax. We drove greater than 60% free cash flow growth, allowing us to invest behind our brands, increase capacity and buy back stock. We also increased our dividend for the 61st consecutive year. I am deeply proud of the results Colgate people have delivered in a challenging operating environment. 2024 will offer many of the same challenges as 2023, geopolitical unrest, foreign exchange headwinds and a challenged consumer, continued softness in China, and a large number of political elections around the world. We enter 2024 with strong momentum and the plans in place to deliver in this environment, as well as greater flexibility in both our income statement and our balance sheet. As we have mentioned over the past few quarters, we're focused on returning to consistent, compounded EPS growth, and our 2024 guidance reflects this ambition. We will continue to invest to drive high-quality, balanced organic sales growth and with both volume and pricing growing. We plan to deliver our productivity to fund this incremental investment while growing earnings per share. This should enable us to deliver strong cashflow growth to invest back in the business and return cash to shareholders. I look forward to discussing our 2024 plans in further detail at CAGNY next month, so you can share the confidence the Colgate-Palmolive team has in our continued growth. And with that, I'll take your questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey guys. So just wanted to focus on market share results in Q4 and as you look ahead, oral care share was obviously strong again and you delivered healthy expansion for the full year. Can you just talk about your forward positioning on the share front in oral care? You've got a tougher comparison here. So how do you think about the sustainability of those share gains as you look out to 2024? And then a similar question on pet. Obviously some industry pressure points, can you sort of juxtapose your market share relative to those industry pressure points and if the unlocked capacity is a significant driver of market share opportunity in the longer term in that business? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Great. Good morning, Dara. Thank you. So let me start a little bit broader on the categories, particularly oral care. We're really encouraged to see the inflection of positive volume growth in the categories around the world. And in many of the regions where we had seen negative volume growth, we started to see an inflection of that towards the end of the fourth quarter in the category. So that gives us great confidence that the category and the pricing that we put in place is continuing to turn. And importantly, we're going to see that growth continue in 2024. As you bring that back to our business, a really strong quarter for oral care, as you mentioned, both from a organic and sales standpoint, but likewise, as that transferred into better market share growth. If I take oral care in general, we were up double digits in the quarter. That translated into strong market share growth, particularly in regions like Latin America, Europe, Africa, Eurasia, and you saw some improved scanner data in the US as well. I think this is a reflection of the core business strategy that we have in place, the increased advertising that we're putting behind the business, as well as a strong innovation pipeline that continued in the back half of 2023 and will continue in 2024 as well. So market share is around the world strong and we would anticipate that, that will see continued growth as we move through the balance of 2024. And I would caveat with some of that, obviously the markets will be challenged given some of the upfront issues I mentioned, but pleasing to see the strong volume growth in some of our bigger regions. If you take Latin America, particularly three strong quarters of strong volume growth, very much driven by oral care, but quite frankly, that was a cross section of all of our categories, and you see that volume improving across all of our divisions. So again, I think we're well positioned on that. Let me talk a little bit about pet, because I think there's some important context to our strategy and why what we're doing is different for the market and what we're doing is working for the marketplace as well. We talked about Colgate being the most penetrated brand in the world. We also know that Hill\u2019s is low penetration, so we will continue to execute a series of differentiated strategies on Hill\u2019s in order to continue to accelerate our growth on that business. So, if I take the three aspects that we think about for Hill\u2019s, reach, awareness, and conversion, reach obviously is a reflection of the strong advertising that we're putting in place to get the message out. With low single digit penetration on Hill\u2019s, we want to ensure the awareness of our superior science is well understood, hence the strategy to drive more TV spending, more digital spending consistently through the quarters. We're spending a lot of time on the effectiveness of that reach to ensure that we're getting the awareness of it. We're using obviously a strong professional endorsement that we have behind vets and continue to accelerate our science and our clinical communication with that key opinion [really] (ph) is critical to the success of the brand. And importantly, as we think about conversion, a lot of non-users in the category, as I mentioned I think on the third quarter call, 5% of consumers are using a therapeutic nutrition, but theoretically 80% should be using a therapeutic nutrition. So a lot of opportunity to continue to drive share. The dynamics in the category, hence you're seeing a little bit of trade down from wet into dry. I mentioned that on the third quarter call, treats have suffered. Now we're not immune to the category softness, but if you take a step back and look at our principal retail environments, pet specialty, neighborhood pet, we're growing share nicely across all of those environments, which means we're helping our retail partners grow category dollars. Penetration was up roughly 10% in the US, our biggest and largest market, so we're very pleased with the progress we have there. Yes, the category is a little softer, but we have the right strategies and differentiated strategies in place to continue to accelerate growth.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nBryan Spillane: Hi. Thanks, operator. Good morning everyone. Maybe this question both for Noel and Stan, just related to Argentina. I think there was maybe a write-down that ran through the other expense line. So if you could give us a little bit more color on that and how much of that may recur and maybe, Noel, just kind of stepping back, I think this week we've heard from a several other companies who maybe even rethinking how they approach Argentina given the devaluation. It's been a while right since we've had this kind of currency crisis in Latin America. So, I don't know, just your perspective, both short-term, how we should be thinking about it from a accounting perspective, Stan? And then, Noel, just how you're thinking about Argentina maybe longer term?\nNoel Wallace: Okay, great. Bryan, good morning and thank you. Let me talk again a little bit of history in Argentina. And I apologize to go down with an extended answer, but I think it's important for the audience to understand how we operate in these hyperinflationary environments. We've been in Argentina close to 100 years. We have an extraordinarily capable management team that understands hyperinflationary counting, understands how to manage the income statement and the balance sheet, understands how to prevent further devaluations on the balance sheet as we move forward. And that's a reflection of just years and years of experience dealing with this level of volatility. We can go back to 2001, 2002, which I think was the last major devaluation in the country. 2014 had one as well. So we're very accustomed to ensuring we're doing everything to manage the potential volatility in a market like Argentina, and that experience has certainly played out. We have always, always continued to invest for the long term in Argentina. We have manufacturing on the ground. We have good relationships in terms of our ability to access dollars. But importantly, given some of the limitations that we've seen over the years on the ability to access dollars, we now have flexibility in the business to import product into the country as well. So we're very attuned to the volatility. I would say on the flip side, good news that price controls seem to have been settled a bit, and we're not going to see as much of those moving forward. So we continue to operate in an environment where we can bring value to the consumer and take pricing in order to offset some of the significant transaction. Now, we're not immune to the devaluation. We'll see that ultimately unfold as we go through the next couple quarters, more on the margin line than the profit line, but ultimately we will make sure we get pricing in the market and that will take some time to flow through into the P&L. But overall, experienced team which I want to thank for their incredible diligence in how they do --they deal with the economic environment there and feel pretty good that we've got real control of what's going on in Argentina notwithstanding there will be continued volatility. So with that, let me give Stan a chance to talk a little bit about how we're managing more closely the income statement.\nStan Sutula: Thanks, Noel. And, Bryan, let me start and pick up where Noel left off on the team. So as an example, we have a gentleman that I work with, Jose Fernando and he is my CFO for Latin America. But, he was also the CFO or the Finance Director in Argentina in 2002. So we have a depth of experience and I think that manifests itself with a very proactive approach to market conditions. So he and I talk on a very regular basis about changing market conditions, and then more importantly the proactive nature of what we do about that. So they've operated in a hyperinflationary environment for a very long time. They take the actions necessary where we look at the long term. So while we operate hyperinflationary environment, we account for it appropriately. You do see the impact of the devaluation and other income other expense. It was not the majority of that line item. So there are other items in there but we dealt with that, we delivered our overall numbers, we improved our productivity, we delivered margin expansion, profit expansion and cash flow. So I think the team's done a very nice job looking at it proactively and dealing with it decisively. So you mentioned on a go forward basis, obviously when you [de-val] (ph), your balance sheet gets smaller. We'll continue to take those actions going forward. We have a growing business there. So, going forward, I would not anticipate a major impact to our results from Argentina.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you [indiscernible] and good morning, everyone. I was wondering if you can talk, Noel, a little bit more about marketing investments. And you elaborated just recently that you mentioned increased [marked] (ph) advertising. And are you also seeing a normalizing promotional environment in the past? You had said that you dialed down and you're reinvesting in promotional capabilities in the US. Can you comment on how you stand right now and how the category promotional levels are? And separately, if you can talk a bit about the supply chain changes that you implemented with the new leadership and also how your position in light of the disruptions in the Middle East and the learnings from the pandemic? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Great. Thanks and good morning, Andrea. So let me take the advertising and promotional piece, and I'll come back and add a little bit of context on some of the great work that Luciano has done as he's come into the new role. The strategy has been quite consistent for the last three to four years about our ability to build brands through great communication and great innovation. And you've seen that obviously flow through the P&L. And despite the fact that we have obviously grown and accelerated advertising meaningfully over the last couple of years. We've continued to deliver against our guidance and exceed our operating profit objectives, which is terrific. Well, that just gives you a sense for the health of the P&L today and our ability to continue to fund investment going forward, and that will clearly be our strategy. Now, likewise, it gives us flexibility to be very focused on the efficiency of that spend. And I can assure you there's not a discussion that goes by where we don't talk about reach and frequency, and the ROI associated with our spend, both at the digital level and the linear TV level. So we're very, very, very focused on the ability to drive more efficiency through the P&L as we accelerate our advertising. And as we said in the prepared comments, we anticipate to continue to accelerate the advertising into 2024. Promotional environment is very constructive right now. I would say it's about 75% to 80% of the pre-COVID levels. So it's come down. It's more moderated. We -- as I've mentioned, in second and third quarter calls, that we will be very selective on increasing the cadence of our promotions in some of the geographies where we may have taken a little bit too much pricing as we led in some of those markets. That will be prudent and thoughtful and focused in certain select markets. But overall, the promotional environment seems very constructive. And our objective is to drive category and healthy volume growth through obviously the accelerated advertising line. On the supply chain, Luciano has come in and really thinking about the continued transformation of that, bringing a lot of good ideas on automation and data analytics and driving network optimization. A lot of our focus over the last couple of years, particularly at Hill's, was increasing capacity, and you saw that through our capital expenditure line. That will moderate as we move forward with more spending being allocated towards efficiency and savings and optimizing the network and very much digitizing the supply chain and getting very aggressive on using data analytics to optimize our efficiency and our case field level. So overall, pleased with where he's taking the group and that team has done just an extraordinary job getting us ready for further optimization moving forward.\nStan Sutula: And, Andrea, I'll just pick up on your last comment around the issues out in the Red Sea and the shipping. So we've been also proactive on that, looking at alternate methods where available, planning for the lead time disruption. And the rest of the supply chain has remained stable, so we don't see issues there. But we have anticipated longer lead times than planned appropriately for 2024.\nOperator: The next question comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi. Please go ahead.\nFilippo Falorni: Hey, good morning, everyone. So, Noel, going back to Hill's, clearly, high single-digit top line growth, excluding the private label, discontinuation, very strong results in the quarter. As you think about '24, like, can you give us a sense of how you see the volume for that business evolving and also the pricing environment in pet food. And then at the margin line, you saw a pretty significant cost headwinds in 2023. Are you seeing any moderation on the cultural and protein side for the Hill's business? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. Good morning, Filippo. Thank you. We see more balanced volume and price as we move into 2024. Obviously, we've had roughly six quarters of aggressive pricing, seven quarters where we've had to take pricing to offset a lot of the inflation that we've seen in agricultural products. To get to your second part of your question, we do see ag prices beginning to moderate, which is good, which over time, as we see the pricing settle out in the markets, we anticipate that volume will come back. But remember, this is the one category we compete in where we've seen prolonged inflation as we move through the back half of 2023. But we anticipate that will definitely moderate as we move into 2024, and pricing likewise will moderate, and we'll see a return to really continuing to drive that successful household penetration number that I shared with you earlier, which is obviously our ability to continue to support strong advertising. So overall, we'll see that more balanced growth as we move through 2024. And on the margin line, as I mentioned again, a more moderating cost. We're still lapping some of the strong inflationary environments that we had in the first half of last year. So that pricing that we've taken in the back half of this year and early in the quarter will stay, but we'll see the volumes start to come back as we move through the back half of the year more meaningfully.\nOperator: The next question comes from Callum Elliott with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nCallum Elliott: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. Really good to see the big uptick in brand spending this year and the success it\u2019s having on competitive performance and growth. My question is, can you talk about some of the other investment buckets outside of advertising and brand spend? I'm thinking R&D, CapEx, some of the more infrastructure capability investments that sit in the P&L. Where are you guys today now versus where you think you need to be? And what's the relative importance of these non-brand spend buckets in your view? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Yeah, Callum, thank you and good morning. A good question because we've talked a lot about positioning ourselves to win in the short term, but more importantly, succeed consistently in the long term. And that has been a lot around obviously the advertising investment. But as you well point out, investing in other areas, specifically capabilities, our digital transformation would be at the forefront of that, training and developing talent, bringing in talent, ensuring that we're optimizing our agency and the talent that they have on that side. So that's an important part of ultimately building the capabilities to continue to drive the effectiveness of our spend and ultimately setting ourselves up for better data architecture and the infrastructure required to do that and do it consistently over the long term. So a lot of investment going in that space as well. On the capital side, we've had, obviously, a lot of spending on the capital side in terms of increased capacity. As I mentioned earlier, we're going to see that start to shift to a lot more optimization and savings projects moving through our manufacturing facilities. As I mentioned earlier, setting up infrastructure for our data architecture and our data transformation. So overall, these are all investments for the long term that we think will continue to play out and allow us to drive that consistent earnings growth that we talked about earlier. Stan, anything to add to that?\nStan Sutula: Callum, the only thing I'd say is when you look at the face of the income statement or balance sheet, the absolute numbers, it doesn't reflect the one of our key jobs here is to allocate resources and we reallocate to those high-growth areas or the areas with the most potential. While that may not show on the absolute line, underneath the covers, that reallocation of resources, whether it's dollars or human capacity is what supports us in analytics and digital and data and S/4 HANA and to enhance all those capabilities. So lots of work under the covers to drive resource to those key areas.\nNoel Wallace: And I'd mentioned very indirectly tied to your question, is the strong cash flow, right? The cash flow is giving us the ability to have a lot more flexibility in how we invest across the business, and that is pleasingly up significantly as you saw in the quarter and the year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nSteve Powers: Hey, thanks and good morning. I wanted to ask about gross margin. It was obviously very strong in the quarter and you expect progress in '24. Maybe just some perspective on the work you've done to get here, the drivers this quarter. But then also, as we look at '24, I'm assuming from a year-over-year perspective, that expansion is heavily weighted to the first part of the year. But sequentially, how should we think about gross margin? Is the fourth quarter a high watermark? Or is there a sequential progress that can be made? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. Let me top line, and I'll let Stan answer a couple of questions. Obviously, I think that pricing, I think cost, I think foreign exchange is obviously the big drivers in the cost line for us. So we've done a terrific job in delivering strong funding to growth. I think a lot of opportunities as we had the supply chain settling down, our ability to start ramping up a lot of the projects that were in many respects on the back burner during COVID. That has allowed us to drive strong funding to growth. We anticipate that that will continue as we move forward into 2024. The pricing has been a big part of the gross margin expansion that we've been very aggressive with over the last six quarters. Yes, pricing will be more balanced as we move forward. So you would anticipate that will be a lesser impact as we move through the gross profit and raw materials will continue to, I think, be inflationary, but far more benign than we've seen in the past and there's clearly a moderation there. So ultimately, hopefully, an opportunity for us. With that, let me turn it over to Stan to give you a little bit more construct to that.\nStan Sutula: So first, we're very pleased with the progress on gross profit through 2023. We had sequential improvement across the categories driven by a broad base of innovation, productivity, that helped offset that commodity situation that we all had to deal with. Now as you think about going forward, coming off of Q4, there are a number of items that always impact the timing, Q4 to Q1. And this year, there's a couple of new ones with a little bit of Argentina, timing of some events worldwide, like Chinese New Year, the timing of when that occurs and where some of this price rolls through, roll through from 2023 and incremental new price. So as we go through the year, we expect that, that will expand, but not at the same kind of levels, obviously, as 2023. So working through that, the teams are focused on productivity. The balance of the top line will change from pricing being the predominant driver to pricing and volume and that productivity will help us drive the margin improvement as we go through the year.\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. I would just simply underscore that there will be a sequential impact at the margin line on Argentina as we will take pricing in the quarter, but that will take a while to flow through to recover the transaction impact of the de-val.\nOperator: The next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS. Please go ahead.\nPeter Grom: Thanks, operator and good morning, everyone. So I wanted to ask specifically about Latin America volume performance, up 8% this quarter, three straight quarters of growth. And I recognize that the comps are somewhat easy, but the growth is still really impressive. Can you maybe just unpack how much of that is a function of category growth versus share performance? And really, how does that inform your view on volume growth looking out to '24 in Latin America specifically? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Thanks. We talked about it, I think, on the second and third call -- on third quarter call that the strength of our Latin America business and ultimately, our ability to lead in pricing and then the consistent history we have of seeing volume return to the categories. And so if I talk at the category level first, what's great is we've seen all three of the categories in which we compete, inflect positively from a category standpoint. And you've obviously seen us growing quite considerably on the volume side, the last three quarters, which is generating good volume share growth for our business. So we're very pleased with the overall performance there. And based on where we see the categories inflecting right now, we're pretty confident that we're going to continue to see balanced growth as we move forward. We'll have to take some currency pricing for sure through the year. But as we've indicated before, we would expect the volume to come back in these markets, and that's exactly what we're seeing. If you drill down to some of our biggest markets, particularly Brazil and Mexico, really strong quarter for both those markets with double-digit volume growth for Brazil and for -- and strong double-digit growth for Mexico as well. So again, a clear indication that the strategy of putting in strong innovation across all price points, getting the advertising, which we accelerated in the fourth quarter, likewise in Latin America, is helping to recover the categories and drive good volume market share in that business.\nOperator: The next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nNik Modi: Yeah. Thank you, good morning, everyone. Just wanted to follow up maybe on the raw material packaging inflation. Just some more perspective. You cited specialty products, I just wanted to get some context around that and what exactly some of those elements are.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Let me throw that one to Stan and he can give you a little bit more context there.\nStan Sutula: Sure. Unlike the prior two years, we don't expect a material impact here. So we see modest inflation in 2024 and there are some areas like every year that go up and down. But there are some new ones this year, things like fish oil has increased significantly. But overall, we expect modest inflation. And so while commodities overall are off of their highs, they're still elevated versus pre-COVID levels. And we expect that as we go through this, there might be a little bit of benefit moving in our favor, but not dramatically. And the only thing I'd say after that is raw materials are one component. So we deal with conversion costs, we deal with transport and logistics costs, and we drive productivity across all these areas through our Funding the Growth program, and that's why we're confident on margin expansion for 2024.\nNik Modi: Great. And Stan, if I could just follow up on Filippo's question. I think he was asking on proteins as it relates to Hill\u2019s. So you cited ag costs, but maybe just comment on protein? What you are seeing\u2026\nStan Sutula: Yeah. Pleasingly, at least at the current point in time, we're not seeing an impact to Hill's in total on an increased basis year-on-year. So we look in total around Hill\u2019s as ag has kind of stabilized here a bit as well as proteins, we don't see a big headwind heading into 2024 based on total for commodities for Hill's. And that's important, because as we drive productivity with modest levels of flow-through on price and the innovation, that will allow us to continue to expand margin on the Hill's portfolio.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nChris Carey: Hey, good morning. So I wanted to ask about productivity and maybe go down to the regional level. I think this was the best productivity in our model anyways, going back roughly 20 years. And so is there anything abnormal about this quarter, any pull forward of productivity? Or are we talking about maybe just productivity muscle continues to build here? And that this is something that we can think about being at a slightly higher run rate go forward? And then just connected to that, this was the best North America margin we've seen in some time. Was there any outsized productivity benefit in the quarter? Or are you just starting to see some easing costs and better efficiency relative to the stabilization we're seeing in the business? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. Thanks, Chris, and good morning. Yeah, a little bit of all of that, quite frankly. Obviously, with the incredible inflation that we've seen over the last 1.5 years across the bulk of our commodity basket, we've had to obviously accelerate the funding the growth and the higher cost obviously have allowed us to generate higher funding the growth. As I mentioned earlier, a lot more efficiency in the plants and our ability to utilize our manufacturing facilities to drive more of the funding the growth projects has likewise allowed us to step up a little bit of that funding the growth in 2023 that we historically had not had the time to do. So a bit of it will be symptomatic of the year and the opportunity. But I think the discipline that we've ingrained and the culture that we have ingrained at Colgate around funding the growth in parallel, likewise with the global productivity initiative that we put in place, has allowed us to generate obviously strong contraction in our costs overall. I wouldn't say use it as a benchmark for going forward. There will be a lot of moving parts to that, but we feel like structurally, we're in a better place on funding the growth. Structurally, we've managed to execute the GPI in line and slightly towards the high end of the guidance range that we provided earlier on that initiative. So we feel like we're in a good place. Pricing will moderate, so it's important that we continue to generate the strong funding the growth and through the P&L in order to generate the margin growth that Stan talked about.\nOperator: The next question comes from Olivia Tong with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nOlivia Tong: Great. Thank you, good morning. First, I wanted to ask you a little bit about the top line, obviously, coming off a very impressive 7% top line growth in Q4. The guide for the fiscal year at sort of 3% to 5%. Can you just provide some perspective thinking about first half versus second half, perhaps the cadence of volume growth as the pricing contribution sort of begins to lap? And then similarly on EPS, obviously, a very strong '23 and Q4, talking about the mid- to high single digits. That, of course -- that range implies potential for growth deceleration in 2024. So just talk about what has to happen to get to the high and what you incorporate in terms of the low end and perhaps an incremental conservatism built into the guide? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Thanks, Olivia, and good morning. So as I said in my front comments, we believe we are well positioned to deliver consistent compounded earnings growth moving forward. And that's certainly reflected in our guidance in the range that we provided. We have a good strong momentum coming out of '23 and heading into '24. And I think most importantly, the flexibility in the P&L and the balance sheet has allowed us to set ourselves up for continued success. As we look at the cadence of that, we will see the balance overall change as we lap the higher pricing that we've had through the bulk of 2023, that will rebalance itself down to be sure and we'll see the volume come back in the categories. As I talked about earlier and ultimately, our focus on driving household penetration with the increased advertising and the market share position that we have. So we think we're in a good position. Comps will get tougher as you say, but we feel that we'll see the volume growth come back and will offer balanced growth throughout the balance of the year. Now recognize that we still have some inflationary markets, Argentina, we talked about, obviously, Nigeria and Turkey that will drive some pricing. We've got some flow through. Most of the pricing we'll see in 2024 will be pricing flow through. We are going to take a little bit of new pricing in certain select markets. But overall, we're going to see a much better balance, as I mentioned upfront. How that ultimately unfolds we shall see but we're definitely planning for more balanced growth as we move through the back half of this year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Hey, everybody. Good morning. Could you maybe just give us a kind of state of play in China, starting maybe with the market and then getting into new business specifically?\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Thank you, Kaumil, and good morning. In China, you've heard it, I think, consistently throughout the earnings season so far that there's a real slowdown in China, and we're not immune to that slowdown. I will say with respect to some of the numbers out there, we feel we've performed very, very well across Greater China. Our business roughly down low to mid-single digits and that was very much commensurate with the category declines that we saw in those markets. Clearly, on the skin health side, we've seen a more acute decline in the categories and therefore, a bigger decline in our business as well. Long term, the market fundamentals remain intact. And I think it will take some time as we move through 2024 for those markets to come back. Obviously, a lot of stimulus money, as you've read, going back into the market, but we shall see the impact that has on consumers and consumption. But we think we're well positioned. The business continues to build share on the Colgate side. We talked about the Holly & Hazel. We think we're now shipping more closely to consumption as we move through the price increase and some of the inventory allocations that we've seen across the trade and we've got a strong innovation pipeline for next year, but we will be thoughtful and prudent on our investment structure in China until we see the categories come back to levels that invite us to invest more. But we feel long term, a good market and the dynamics are there, but we want to be thoughtful in the short term.\nOperator: The next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks, good morning. On North America, it was great to see volumes inflect a positive this quarter, and you called out growth not just in oral care, but also in bar soap, liquid hand soap and cleaners. So I know there's a lot of things that kind of contribute to that better performance. You mentioned more balanced promotions. But I was wondering if could you spend a little bit of time talking about innovation across the business and any plans for '24? And maybe also if you could talk a little bit about any plans you may have around hand dish and plans to kind of stabilize and regain share in that business? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. Hi, Lauren. Good morning. Thanks. I can't really talk specifically to the innovation that we have in 2024. But I can say, obviously, that we've got a strong pipeline and a much more balanced pipeline across all of our businesses. The acceleration in advertising is thoughtful and strategic as well that we will support more of our businesses in North America. I think that's a reflection of the really strong operating profit growth that we've reinjected back into the business. So we feel like we're in a much better place to support some of the categories that had been declining in advertising over the years. So we feel we're in a good place to reflect continued growth on the volume side. Obviously, the pricing will moderate quite considerably in the US as we move through 2024. And we've got a strong innovation pipeline across the categories in order to ensure that we continue to drive market share. The other aspect of it is, as I've talked about, a more balanced cadence of promotions, and we will make sure we execute those very, very thoughtfully. We have no intentions on going back to the historical numbers there, but we feel we've got some opportunities in select accounts in select parts of the country in order to accelerate where we've seen competition be quite aggressive. So good position. Really happy with the health of the P&L. Really happy with the advertising that we put back in the P&L, which will bode well for the long-term health of that business.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMark Astrachan: Yeah, thanks and good morning, everybody. Two questions for me. One, on North America. So global market share better, in North America markets for toothpaste a little bit weaker, advertising spend obviously increased in 4Q and for the year. How much is the right level? And is there a correlation in the US between advertising and volume performance? Is there more to it than that R&D, whatever, curious there? And then on the Hill's business, given the weakness in pet specialty channel, has it made you think at all about whether your distribution mix in terms of where the product is sold, is right at this point? Or do you potentially think about expanding that to other retailer areas? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. Good morning, Mark. Thanks. So North America first. Clearly, we're trying to get much more balanced investment across North America. We needed to get the P&L, particularly the middle P&L in the right shape, and that was a strategic choice that we made. A strategic choice enabled by, I think, the broadness of health of our business around the world that has allowed us to obviously accelerate the investment in North America as we took more pricing in the market. So we have a strong innovation pipeline. We anticipate that we'll continue to increase our investment levels. This is not for the short term, this is for the long-term health of that business, which we believe to be a very, very vital market for our success in the future. And we've seen the benefits coming through across our overall consumption. See some -- a little softness in the Nielsen tracked channels, I'll say that our non-tracked channels are growing at 3 to 4 multiple of the tracked channels. So we feel the overall investment in its entirety is proving to grow the consumption and the sales that we need in that marketplace. So long story short, we think we're in a good position for that. On your Hill's comment, our focus is in the channels where we compete. And we believe we're a differentiated unique product that drives the premium nutrition side. Science clearly is the segment that continues to grow, particularly amongst pet specialty. We have no plans to expand distribution in the food drug mass. We believe that would deteriorate the brand and we have very unique distribution policies that require us to be in the channels that we're in. And we continue, as I've mentioned earlier, to feel we have significant upside in those channels and the brand penetration that I mentioned earlier continues to grow. So in a good place, no intentions on expanding distribution. That being said, as you know, the bulk of our business is done in the US. We will be very selective about market expansion on the Hill's business, making sure we get the business model right, making sure the vet becomes a core part of that expansion strategy because that would drive long-term sustainable profitability for the business. And so we'll continue to look for opportunities as we increase the health of that business and the expansion needed in markets around the world.\nOperator: The next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nRobert Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. Noel, I was wondering if you can talk about India for a little bit. A lot of the companies that we talk to are very excited about the market and see it increasingly vibrant. So perhaps maybe review your position there, market share trends, if you're seeing more opportunities and what your plans are? And then just a kind of a housecleaning item for Stan. It looked like there was a $0.07 impact on the other income item under -- on other income, but there were some offsets there and some asset sales and a value-added tax refund. If you could kind of just let us better understand exactly what's going on there. Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. Thanks, Rob, and good morning. So India, you saw the results this week, very strong results across the board, 9% organic, continued strong pricing and sequentially better volume in that market. I would likewise say we remain very excited and bullish on the market in India. We'll see the continued return to the rural segment, the vitality of the rural segment, which will bode well for volume as we move -- as we look forward. The other aspect, which I won't get into a lot of specific details, we have some really strong innovation plan for India, particularly around our core businesses. And we're excited to see that obviously be delivered in the market and executed. The team is doing an exceptional job finding added distribution points to make sure that we continue to capitalize on investment strategy. So bullish on India, good results and sequentially right where we'd like to see their business today and setting us up for ultimately another strong year in 2024.\nStan Sutula: Hey, Rob, let me pick up on your second questionnaire and other income, other expense. As we talked earlier, that is made up of a number of items, both from this year and last year. And Argentina devaluation is certainly an impact, but not the majority of it. We also have some start-up costs in there, some onetime items from this year and last year. What I would say is that's not a new run rate. That's not going to continue into next [year at] (ph) that level. And you should think about these as kind of onetime events in nature. So these change as you go through the year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Edward Lewis with Redburn Atlantic. Please go ahead.\nEdward Lewis: Yes, thanks very much. Just wanted to talk on Europe. Another quarter of strong pricing this quarter. And looking back, I think it's 9.5% for 2023 or 4.5% in 2022. So just be really interested to hear how you're thinking about pricing over here because consistently, I guess, in the past, pricing hasn't been a big part of the story in Europe. Is this kind of a new kind of attitude we should expect to continue doing sort of more pricing in general coming out of Europe?\nNoel Wallace: Yes. Thanks, Ed. Good question. We think we've learned a tremendous amount on pricing in Europe and really work closely with our retail partners to find ways to drive value and ultimately their categories. Clearly, a significant inflation over the last six or seven quarters, which certainly helped to take more pricing in the marketplace. But I think our teams have exited \u201823 with more confidence. Now there's no question as inflation declines in 2024, we'll get a much more balanced view of pricing and volume moving back into the P&L. But I think some good stories that have allowed us to really accelerate our innovation and drive real value in the categories by relaunching our brands. You heard Jean-Luc talked about that at Deutsche Bank Conference, and I think that continues to be a consistent theme. So a lot of learning there, not saying it's going to be a challenge as we move forward to get more pricing in Europe, but we believe we've got the tools and the vehicle is to continue to find ways to accelerate category growth and therefore, our margin growth in the business.\nOperator: This concludes the Q&A portion of our call. I would now like to return the call to Noel Wallace, Colgate's Chairman, President and CEO, for any closing remarks.\nNoel Wallace: Well, thanks, everyone, for joining the call this morning. We hope you agree that the strategies and plans we have in place to deliver consistent compounded profitable growth to drive value for all of our stakeholders is there. And let me particularly thank all the Colgate employees around the world for their incredible hard work and dedication to deliver these strong results in 2023 and thank them in advance for the results they're going to continue to deliver in 2024. Thanks, everyone. We'll see you down in Florida.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's call.

        "article_content": " \n\nThe First of Long Island Corporation (FLIC) has disclosed its financial outcomes for the fourth quarter of 2023, revealing a net income of $6.1 million with a net interest margin of 2%. Despite this, the company experienced a year that did not surpass the record earnings of 2022, primarily due to a diminished net interest margin. \nThe bank's non-interest income was stable, while non-interest expenses saw a $3 million reduction. The company anticipates an improvement in the net interest margin in the latter half of 2024 as short-term rates are expected to decline. They also project an increase in fee income from checking account program changes and a further decrease in non-interest expenses. \nThe bank continues to pay dividends at the current rate and may consider buybacks depending on future earnings and capital levels.\nThe First of Long Island Corporation's financial results for the fourth quarter of 2023 show a mix of challenges and strategic plans to navigate the upcoming year. While the bank did not achieve the record earnings of 2022, they have laid out a clear roadmap for recovery and growth in 2024. The bank's commitment to maintaining dividends and the possibility of share buybacks reflect a focus on shareholder value, even as they manage the impacts of macroeconomic factors such as the Federal Reserve's rate increases. As the bank moves forward, stakeholders will be looking forward to the first-quarter update for further insights into the bank's performance and strategic initiatives.\nThe First of Long Island Corporation (FLIC) has shown resilience amidst a challenging financial landscape, as evidenced by its recent financial disclosures. To provide additional context and depth to the company's current situation and future prospects, let's delve into some InvestingPro insights.\nInvestingPro Data highlights a Market Cap of $290.07 million, underscoring the company's presence in the market. With a Price/Earnings (P/E) Ratio of 9.74 and an adjusted P/E Ratio for the last twelve months as of Q3 2023 at 9.7, FLIC is positioned below the industry average, suggesting a potentially undervalued stock.

On the call today are Chris Becker, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Janet Verneuille, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded. A copy of the earnings release is available on the corporation's website at fnbli.com and on the earnings call webpage at https://www.cstproxy.com/fnbli/earnings/2023/Q4. Before we begin, the company would like to remind everyone that this call may contain certain statements that constitute forward-looking statements made under the Safe Harbor provisions of the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any such statements, including as set forth in the company's filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors should also refer to our 2022 10-K filed on March 9, 2023, as supplemented by our 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, for a list of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated or implied by such statements. I would now like to turn the call over to Chris Becker.\nChris Becker: Thank you. Good afternoon. And welcome to The First of Long Island Corporation's earnings call for the fourth quarter and year end of 2023. I'm proud to say key aspects of our transformation strategy, which began in 2020 are largely in the rearview. The Bank has a fresh look, top-notch technology, innovative partnerships, a more efficient branch network, bankers focused on commercial relationship growth, a proven history of strong asset quality, all of which is underpinned by a strong capital position with leverage and tangible capital ratios of 10.1% and 9% respectively. Combined with optimism about short term rates moving lower, especially for a bank that remains generally liability sensitive, we entered 2024 with a bright outlook for the future. As reported in our first quarter 2023 earnings call, we proactively completed two balance sheet repositioning transactions that converted approximately $450 million of fixed rate assets to floating rates to lessen our liability sensitivity. These two transactions were generating over $2 million in quarterly pre-tax earnings as we entered 2024. It was the right move in our early 2023. As we considered similar transactions throughout the remainder of the year, the benefit of rates staying flat or moving up did not outweigh the risk of rates moving down. We will consider additional strategies for 2024. But based on the current sentiment for rates, we believe we have struck an appropriate balance so our net interest margin can begin to bounce back nicely as short term rates come down. The technology upgrades announced in the summer of 2022 are built, tested and planned to go live in February 2024. Upgrades to our technology include Fiserv (NYSE:FI)'s DNA core processing system, business online banking, business mobile app, branch platform and teller systems, biometric identification and paper eliminating efficiencies. I cannot thank our team enough for their outstanding work and dedication to this project. We believe our new best in class systems will enhance customer experience and provide our bankers with the tools needed to service our clients and generate new relationship based business. The transition to a more commercially focused institution that began in 2020 continued to make progress in 2023, thanks to the hard work of our commercial lending teams and their branch partners. A key component of this objective is growing our commercial and industrial loan and owner occupied mortgage business. This combined relationship based portfolio has increased 12% per year on average since 2020 and our total commercial loan portfolio has grown $0.5 million over the same period. Other moves such as consolidating our back office operations into a new administrative headquarters, selling vacated buildings, closing branches and adjusting branch hours are all starting to pay dividends. Refreshing our brand and building a social media presence are getting the Bank noticed. We believe the Bank is now a much better company with a solid footing both physically and digitally. Our team is 25% smaller than it was just four years ago, but much more adept at meeting today's challenges. Janet Verneuille will now take you through financial highlights of the full year and fourth quarter. Janet?\nJanet Verneuille: Thanks Chris. Good afternoon, everyone. Net income for 2023 totaled $26.2 million and fully diluted earnings per share were $1.16. The company's return on average assets was 0.62% and its return on average equity was 7.14%. Our performance for 2023 did not match up to the record net income and fully diluted earnings per share performance the company produced in 2022 of $46.9 million and $2.04 respectively. In 2022, ROA was 1.11% and ROE was 12.13%. The overwhelming reason for the decline in earnings was the drop in net interest margin to 2.16% in 2023 from 2.89% in 2022. The pace of decline in the net interest margin has slowed significantly throughout 2023 with the quarterly margin declining 57 basis points in the first half of the year compared to 17 basis points in the second half of the year. The Bank's non-interest income, excluding net losses on sales of securities, pension credits and other onetime items was relatively flat when comparing 2023 and 2022. The Bank's non-interest expense for 2023 of $64 million decreased $3 million from $67 million in 2022. Salaries and employee benefits declined by $3.7 million, mostly due to lower incentive and stock based compensation expense as the Bank fell short of its performance metrics this year. An increase of over $700,000 in FDIC insurance expense due to higher assessment rates partially offset the savings and incentive compensation. The Bank's effective tax rate was 11% for 2023, down from 19.4% in 2022. The decline in the effective tax rate was due to an increase in the percentage of pretax income derived from the Bank's real estate investment trust and the Bank owned life insurance. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2023 totaled $6.1 million, down $741,000 from the linked quarter. The decrease is mostly due to lower net interest income of $1.5 million, resulting from alternative higher priced funding that replaced seasonal deposit outflows. Additionally, the provision for credit losses increased $1.1 million as $1.16 million in net charge-offs were partially offset by net improvements in various qualitative and quantitative factors in our ACL model. These items were partially offset by lower salaries and employee benefits expense and lower income tax expense for the same reasons mentioned previously for the full year of 2023. The Bank's net interest margin was 2% in the fourth quarter compared to 2.13% in the linked quarter. The 13-point decrease in the net interest margin in the fourth quarter was largely due to seasonal outflow of lower cost nonmaturity deposits being replaced by higher wholesale funding costs. The Bank's quarterly noninterest income was $2.4 million, which is consistent with prior guidance and prior quarters. The Bank's noninterest expense decreased $1.4 million to $14.8 million compared to the linked quarter. The decline is mostly attributable to lower incentive and stock based compensation expense, the same reason as for the full year. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2023 was down $3.8 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease was mainly attributable to the reasons cited with respect to the year-over-year linked quarter changes, including a $7.8 million decline in net interest income, an increase in the provision for credit losses of $818,000, a decline in salaries and employee benefits expense of $2.7 million and a decline in income tax expense of $1.7 million. The yield curve has been inverted for approximately 18 months, one of the longest periods in history, and it continues to make it difficult for banks to utilize their excess capital to leverage the balance sheet. As far as the balance sheet is concerned, on the asset side, the bank continues to deploy approximately $80 million to $90 million in quarterly cash flows from our securities and loan portfolios into new assets at current market rates. The bank has approximately $860 million or 21% of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year, but remains liability sensitive. On the liability side of the balance sheet, pricing pressure continued through year end. Although the bank priced competitively to maintain deposit balances, total deposits on a linked quarter declined 4.85% to $3.3 billion, mostly due to seasonally lower municipal and tax escrow deposits. The deposits were replaced by overnight borrowings and FHLB advances. The Bank's total wholesale funding, including brokered deposits, was $648.7 million or 15% of total assets on December 31, 2023 and had a weighted average cost of funds of 4.6% and an average maturity of six months. In addition, the bank has $352 million in retail time deposits that mature in 2024 with an average cost of funds of 4.2%. As this funding matures in the coming quarters, we anticipate some final additional upward cost pressure. However, management believes additional interest expense from liability repricing will be largely offset by additional income as asset cash flows repriced higher leading to margin stabilization. Once the Federal Reserve begins to lower short term rates, we believe margin expansion should follow shortly thereafter. Liquidity indicators remain ample. We maintained $1.1 billion in collateralized borrowing lines with the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and the Federal Reserve Bank. We also had $386 million in unencumbered cash and securities. In total, we had approximately $1.5 billion of available liquidity at the end of the quarter, which is well in excess of our uninsured and uncollateralized deposits. The bank did not repurchase any shares during 2023. We still have approximately $15 million authorized under the most recent Board approved stock repurchase plan, and given our strong capital levels, likely will resume the buyback program in 2024. Chris will talk a little bit now about 2024. Chris?\nChris Becker: Thanks, Janet. In preparing for today's remarks, I reviewed our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call, which included forward-looking challenges for 2023. I specifically cited that Federal Reserve's increases in interest rates have not been at this pace in over 40 years, putting downward pressure on the bank's net interest margin. We projected a lower margin. I mentioned the political and regulatory message of removing so-called junk fees is limiting the Bank's ability to charge for the fundamental services we provide. We projected noninterest income of $2.5 million per quarter in 2023. I stated that regulatory oversight continues to pile on operational costs, no matter an institution size. But management efforts to create efficiencies through branch and back office consolidations have kept expense growth in check. We projected noninterest expenses between $16.5 million and $17 million per quarter in 2023. As we all know now, the Federal Reserve increased rates four more times during 2023, putting more pressure on our net interest margin than anticipated. Backing out our net loss on sales of securities, we were spot-on with our 2023 projected noninterest income averaging close to $2.5 million per quarter. And while thousands of more pages of regulatory guidance were issued, our noninterest expenses came in lower than projected principally due to lower incentive compensation expense. Other than incentive compensation, noninterest expenses were in line with 2023 projections. Let's consider these same three areas as we enter 2024. First, our net interest margin. Our 2024 projections include the Federal Reserve beginning to lower rates during the second half of the year. As Janet reported, our net interest margin in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 2%. We currently believe there will be downward pressure during the first quarter of 2024 with a leveling out during the second quarter of the year. During the third and fourth quarters of 2024, we are projecting the net interest margin to begin to recover as short term rates begin to come down. Our current thinking is consistent with my comments during our third quarter earnings call that the margin should bottom out over the next two quarters, referring to the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024. Next, our noninterest income. During 2023, we fine tuned our business checking account analysis program and adjusted service charges on consumer checking accounts to encourage more debit card and e-statement usage. These changes should produce some additional fee income in 2024, and as such, we are projecting noninterest income to average $2.6 million per quarter in 2024. Lastly, our noninterest expenses. Even though we are investing in new technology, our continued success with our branch optimization plan, back office consolidations, selling vacated buildings and eliminating our residential mortgage group, among other initiatives, have reduced our run rate of noninterest expenses. We are projecting noninterest expenses to average $6.25 million per quarter in 2024 or $250,000 to $500,000 lower than 2023 guidance. Please note that our noninterest income and noninterest expense guidance are averages and quarterly variants are likely. With that, I will turn it back to our operator for questions.\nOperator: Our first question for today comes from Chris O'Connell from KBW.\nChris O'Connell: Just on the last item on the guide, you said 6.25% -- that seems low\u2026\nChris Becker: 25%\u2026\nChris O'Connell: And does the compensation line, is that kind of reset back to normal immediately for the first quarter?\nChris Becker: It will reset back to normal for the first quarter. But we do have some efficiencies going in there as from some of the branch consolidations and back office consolidations, our computer upgrades and such, and just from the work we've done throughout the year on staffing in the branches. So we realized an entire year's benefit of that in 2024.\nChris O'Connell: And then on the margin, I mean, it sounds like maybe down a little bit in the first quarter, but the pace of that should probably slow based on the funding cost kind of having a little bit less pressure into the first quarter, and some of the deposits may be coming back in on seasonality.\nChris Becker: If you look at the fourth quarter with some of the deposit outflows, which were -- the bulk of that was some municipal deposit outflows and in November and December each year, we pay out from our escrow accounts, the real estate tax bills. So that number alone was $35 million. And with those outflows and as Janet mentioned, that money going into overnight borrowings, that's more expensive, that obviously pushed down the fourth quarter margin a little bit. So far, we've already brought $35 million back in this first quarter. So that will also help relieve some of that pressure as that money flows back in.\nChris O'Connell: And regarding the second half of the year with Fed cuts, maybe you guys could provide a little bit of color as to how you see the margin reacting depending on the level or the pace of Fed cuts and how much kind of upward mobility it has?\nJanet Verneuille: So for every 25 basis points of the Fed cuts, over time, we're predicting that the margin will improve 4 to 5 basis points. Again, this is over time. It depends, obviously, on many factors. But that's where we're projecting it to increase.\nChris O'Connell: And last one for me, just what's a good go-forward tax rate for 2024?\nJanet Verneuille: So looking at between 12% and 13% for the next year, some of the benefits of the REIT are capping out. So it's going up slightly.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Twerdahl of Piper Sandler.\nAlex Twerdahl: I just wanted to -- I guess I'll start with sort of the outlook for the loan portfolio. Obviously, you guys have plenty of capital, liquidity, obviously, not as much and maybe that's a little more strained. But as you kind of set yourself up for potential rate cuts and maybe some easing liquidity or funding costs. Do you think we could see a little bit more loan growth in 2024?\nChris Becker: We do think there will be some growth in 2024. We don't think it's going to be as robust as we would all like, but we do think that there will be some lower single digit loan growth during this year. Last year, loans were pretty flat throughout the year to down. And with some -- hopefully, some rate relief, and really, you've already seen some of that because you've seen five and 10-year rates come -- call for their high. So that does also provide some rate relief as the loan rates are pricing off more of that end of the curve. So we're anticipating to see some additional volume. The pipeline at the end of the year was not overly robust, about $100 million at year end. But there's certainly some more conversations going on and some more activity, so we're encouraged that, that pipeline is going to grow.\nAlex Twerdahl: And I think in the past, you've given us sort of the average yield on the pipeline. Are you able to provide that?\nChris Becker: The pipeline is always difficult, right, because it's floating kind of with the rates moving every day. But I can tell you that the loan closings that we had in the fourth quarter, it was right -- the yield that was right around 7%. So it should be pretty much in line with that. I shouldn't stray too much from that.\nAlex Twerdahl: And I just wanted to ask you, how you guys are thinking about the dividend going forward?\nJanet Verneuille: Well, we look at the dividend, obviously, every quarter. We analyze it. And right now, we're expecting that we'll continue to pay the dividend going forward.\nAlex Twerdahl: Yes, at the current level because I know you guys have a pretty extensive history of increasing the dividend annually, and it's something that probably has given you a lot of -- I don't say people would rely on it, but it's a nice streak. Is that a consideration, is it really going to take it sort of one quarter at a time and sort of look at it from a payout ratio standpoint and from a capital standpoint?\nChris Becker: We appreciate that streak. I think our shareholders appreciate that streak. Our Board of Directors appreciate that streak. And again, in an environment like this, you look at it quarter-by-quarter, but obviously, our Board declared the fourth quarter dividend to keep it going. It just we just paid that out in early January. And so at this point, they've committed to continue to pay the quarterly dividend. But last year we did not have an increase -- we usually do one increase a year. Last year, we did keep the quarterly dividend flat at $0.21 a share.\nAlex Twerdahl: And then I guess, Janet, I think you said in your prepared remarks that buybacks will be back on the table in the near term. Can you just give us a sense for sort of what would trigger buybacks or capital levels that you feel comfortable with or things like that?\nJanet Verneuille: The capital ratio is at 10%. So we're going to analyze that each quarter, take a look at it and if there's room for buybacks -- like we said, we didn't do any last year. We'll definitely based on where we project earnings to go for the year. We do have to watch that. We would consider buying back. But I don't think we have a number at this point.\nChris Becker: I think we've talked before that as a National Bank, we do watch our dividend ability to dividend money up to the holding company based on the prior two years retained earnings in the current year. So we do monitor that also. So that's also something that could be a little bit of a governor on how much money we dividend up to the holding company. So that's why it's kind of a quarter-by-quarter item that we have to consider.\nAlex Twerdahl: And then I just wanted to ask about the sort of the pickup in NPLs this quarter? If you can give us a little bit more color on something that is relatively uncharacteristic for you guys?\nChris Becker: So unfortunately, when we seem to have any LPLs, it seems to come up. So we actually have a grand total of about $1 million in non-accruals. There was one C&I relationship that we took the -- $1.4 million charge-off in the fourth quarter. It was a business that generally had longer term fixed rate contracts and that created some losses due to pandemic price increases and delays and such. And we take proactive steps to resolve that and do it quickly. But we charge that as a part of charge off. There's still about a $600,000 balance on that loan, which we have fully reserved for. But that $600,000 is part of that. And then we have one small residential mortgage, just over a little over $300,000, that's part of an estate. So we're not concerned about that. And then there's a even smaller, less than $100,000 SBA small business line, SBA guaranteed small business line that is in that list. So the grand total is three loans in there, all below $1 million. And in the total, it is $1 million.\nOperator: This concluded our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the floor back to Chris Becker for closing comments.\nChris Becker: Thank you for your attention and participation on the call today. I want to reassure our loyal shareholders that the Board of Directors and management team are focused on returning to and improving on our historical performance metrics. We look forward to talking to you at the end of the first quarter. Have a good rest of the day.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

I will now hand over to our CEO, Mikael Bratt.\nMikael Bratt: Thank you, Anders. Looking on the next slide, I\u2019d like to recognize the entire team for delivering another strong quarter, which reflects our strong execution culture. We ended 2023 on a strong note as we achieved or exceeded all our 2023 indications. In the quarter, our organic sales grew by 16% outperforming light vehicle production significantly, especially in rest of Asia and Japan. The strong growth was mainly a result of product launches and customer compensations for inflationary pressure, as well as higher than expected light vehicle production. We generated a broad-based improvement in key areas, including gross margin and adjusted operating margins both year-over-year and sequentially. Our cash flow was strong and the net depth leverage improved, while we increased our dividend and repurchased shares for 150 million in the quarter or approximately US$352 million for the year. We are making progress towards our intention of reducing our indirect workforce by up to 2,000. We now expect savings of around $50 million in 2024 from these initiatives. Order intake developed well. It is especially encouraging to see the strong order intake with fast growing Chinese OEMs. For 2024 we foresee sales growing in mid-single-digit despite an expected modest decline in light vehicle production. 2024 should take us one important step closer to our adjusted operating margin targets, driven by improved call-off stability, growth, structural and strategic initiatives, and customer compensations. However, the heightened seasonality of earnings of prior years is likely to be repeated in 2024. Now looking at the order intake more in detail on the next two slides. Our order intake for the full year continued to develop well, supporting long-term growth in a rapidly changing technology environment with many new OEMs and EV platforms. The estimated lifetime value of our 2023 order intake was the highest in the past five years. The strong order intake is an evidence that our company remains the clear leader in the passive safety automotive industry. One of our internal key performance indicators, customer satisfaction, continues to be on a high level. We continue to strive for improving products, services, processes and cost while maintaining industry-leading quality. Our strong order intake with a good mix of EV and ICE platforms, and the high level of customer satisfaction supports our confidence regarding growth also beyond 2024. Looking on the next slide. In 2023 order intake for new EV platform was high, both with new EV makers and traditional OEMs. We estimate that around 45% of our order intake in 2023 was for future electric vehicles. Consumer demand for EVs may have faded somewhat in the short-term, but regulatory changes supporting EVs will increase, at least in Europe. Although our products are drivetrain agnostic, it is important to have balanced exposure both to EVs and ICE to capture future market growth. With the order book that we have built, we believe that we have a good exposure to all growing segments. New automakers, mainly North America and China, accounted for around 25% of our order intake. Fast-growing Chinese OEMs accounted for around 50% of our order intake in China and we expect this group of OEMs to account for close to 40% of our Chinese sales in 2024, up from 22% in 2022. We won multiple awards supporting new markets and industry trends like Pretensioner Seatbelts for rear-seat passengers, airbags with low-carbon cushion material, as well as anti-submarining airbags for zero-gravity style seats for self-driving vehicles. As a result of the strong order intake in the past years, we expect an increase in overall product launches in 2024, especially in China and Europe. This development contributes to building an even stronger platform for our long-term success. Now looking at the significant sequential cost improvements during 2023 on the next slide. Year-to-date, we have generated a broad-based improvement in key areas, both year-over-year and sequentially. On this slide, we highlight the sequential improvements. In the fourth quarter, we continued to actively address our cost base, while successfully negotiating with our customers to secure pricing and other compensations that reflect the higher inflation. Our direct labor productivity continues to trend up, supported by the implementation of our strategic initiatives, including automation and digitalization. Our gross margin improved by 410 basis points compared to the first quarter and by 140 basis points from the third quarter. This is mainly the result of the higher labor efficiency and customer compensations. The positive trend for RD&E and SG&A in relation to sales have continued and have now declined by 270 basis points since Q1, partly as a result of normal seasonality with high engineering reimbursements in the fourth quarter. Combined with the gross margin improvement, this led to substantial improvement in adjusted operating margin. Looking now at financials in more detail on the next slide. Sales in the fourth quarter increased by 18% year-over-year, mainly due to higher light vehicle production, new product launches, higher prices and other compensations, and favorable currency translation effects. The strong sales increase and cost reduction activities led to substantial improvement in adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income increased by more than 40% to $334 million from $233 million last year. The adjusted operating margin was 12.1% in the quarter, an increase by over 2 percentage points from the same period last year and by almost 7 percentage points from the first quarter. Operating cash flow was $447 million, which was $15 million lower than the same period last year. The main reason for the lower cash flow was the unusual strong cash flow last year, which was related to timing effects of customer recovery. Looking now on the structural cost savings activities on the next slide. To secure our medium- and long-term competitiveness, and to support our financial targets, we launched a cost reduction initiative in June 2023, with the intent of reducing our indirect headcount by up to 2,000 and a direct workforce headcount reduction of up to 6,000. We estimate that the annual cost reductions will amount to around $130 million when fully implemented. With around $50 million already in 2024 and around $100 million expected in 2025. Total accrual for capacity alignment in 2023 amounted to US$280 million. We do not plan to announce further major reduction initiatives details. At the end of 2023, around 75% of the planned indirect reductions were detailed and announced. We already see positive impact on direct payable productivity as a result. Looking now on our sales growth in more detail on the next slide. Our consolidated net sales increased to almost US$2.8 billion, a new quarterly record. This was over $400 million higher than a year earlier driven by price, volume, mix and currencies. Out-of-period cost compensations contributed with US$45 million. Out-of-period compensations are retroactive price adjustments and other compensations that mainly relate to the first three quarters but were negotiated in the fourth quarter. Looking on the regional sales split, Asia accounted for 41%, America\u2019s for 31% and Europe for 28%. We outline our organic sales growth compared to LVP on the next slide. I am very pleased that our organic sales growth significantly outperformed global light vehicle production growth in the fourth quarter, as we continue to execute on our strong order book. According to S&P Global, fourth quarter light vehicle production increased by 9% year-over-year. This was more than 5 percentage points higher than expectations at the beginning of the quarter, with most of the higher than expected production coming from domestic OEMs in China and in North America as the impact of the UAW strike was smaller than expected. In the quarter, we outperformed global light vehicle production by around 7 percentage points with strong performance especially in the Rest of Asia and Japan. The modest underperformance in China was mainly driven by a negative customer mix following strong light vehicle production growth for lower safety content vehicles. On to the next slide. For the full year, we outperformed global light vehicle production by around 9 percentage points despite a negative regional light vehicle production. We outperformed in Japan by 15 percentage points, in the rest of Asia by 14 percentage points and in China by 8 percentage points. The performance in China was mainly driven by increasing sales to domestic Chinese OEMs. Our sales to this group outperformed light vehicle production by 17% percentage points and accounted for 28% of our sales in China up from 22% in 2022. In 2023, our global market share was around 45%. This is almost 6 percentage points higher than five years ago when the electronics business was spun up. Our global market position is strong in all categories with 45 -- 47% of airbags, 45% of seatbelts and 40% of steering wheels. Supported by new launches, market share gains and content per vehicle growth, as well as our further price increases, we expect sales to outperform light vehicle production by 5 percentage points to 6 percentage points in 2024. On the next slide, we see some key model launches for the fourth quarter. During 2023, we had a record number of product launches, especially in China, Europe and Japan. For 2024, we see another step up in number of product launches, particularly in the first half of the year. The trend towards electrification is clear on this slide, with seven models being available as electric versions. The models shows -- shown here have an out-of-date content per vehicle of around $110 or higher, with the highest at over US$800. In terms of out-of-date sales potential, the Zeekr 007 launch is the most significant. I will now hand it over to our CFO, Fredrik Westin, who will talk you through the financials on the next slide.\nFredrik Westin: Thank you, Mikael. This slide highlights our key figures for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Our net sales were almost $2.8 billion. This was an increase of 18% year-over-year. Gross profit increased by $131 million or by 33% to $530 million, while the gross margin increased by 2.2 percentage points to 19.3%. The adjusted operating income increased from $233 million to $334 million and the adjusted operating margin increased by 220 basis points to 12.1%. Non-GAAP adjustments amounted to $97 million, almost entirely for capacity alignments. Adjusted earnings per share diluted, increased by $1.91, while the main drivers were $0.75 from higher adjusted operating income, $1.09 from tax and $0.10 from other items partly offset by financial items. Our adjusted return on capital employed and return on equity increased to 33% and 47%, respectively. We increased the dividends to $0.68 per share in the quarter and repurchased and retired 1.5 million shares for around $150 million under our existing $1.5 billion stock repurchase program. Looking now on the adjusted operating income bridge on the next slide. In the fourth quarter of 2023, our adjusted operating income of $334 million was $101 million higher than the same quarter last year. Our operations were positively impacted by improved pricing and other customer compensations, higher volumes, lower costs for premium freight, as well as our strategic initiatives, but partly offset by headwinds from general cost inflation. The impact from raw material prices were $14 million positive. Out-of-period cost compensation was approximately $37 million higher than during the same period last year. The FX impact was limited. Cost for SG&A and RD&E net combined was $30 million higher, mainly due to lower engineering income and labor cost inflation. In relation to sales, it was unchanged compared to last year. The margin was also affected by the accruals for warranty and recalls of $17 million or 65 basis points. The accruals are related to three different cases. As a result, the leverage on the higher sales, excluding currency effects and warranty and recall costs, was in the upper half of our typical 20% to 30% operational leverage range. Looking now at the full year financial results on the next slide. Despite higher than expected light vehicle production, 2023 was again a turbulent year with labor cost inflation, supplier disruptions, customer price negotiations and continued volatile light vehicle production. Our net sales were $10.5 billion, with sales increasing organically by over 18%, twice the increase in the underlying light vehicle production and 3 percentage points higher than expected in the beginning of the year. The adjusted operating income increased by 54% to $920 million. The adjusted operating margin was 8.8%, compared to our guidance of around 8.5% to 9%. The operating cash flow was $982 million, compared to the guidance of around $900 million. Adjusted earnings per share increased by $3.79 per share to $8.19 per share, where the main drivers were $2.51 from higher adjusted operating income and $1.31 from lower income taxes, partly offset by $0.18 from financial items. Dividends of $2.66 per share were paid, and we repurchased and retired 3.7 million shares for around $352 million. Sales, adjusted operating income, operating cash flow, as well as the adjusted earnings per share were all the highest we have ever achieved. Looking now at the full year adjusted operating income bridge on the next slide. In 2023, our adjusted operating income of $920 million was $322 million higher than last year. The impact from raw material prices was limited. FX impacted the operating profit negatively by $54 million. This was mainly a result of negative translation effects from the Mexican peso. Costs for SG&A and RD&E net combined was $95 million higher. However, in relation to sales, it was down 60 basis points. As a result, the leverage on the higher sales, excluding currency effects, was slightly above our typical 20% to 30% operational leverage range. This is despite not getting any leverage on the inflation compensation from our customers. Looking now on the cash flow on the next slide. For the fourth quarter of 2023, operating cash flow decreased by $15 million to $447 million compared to the same period last year, which was impacted by positive timing effects of customer compensations. Capital expenditures net decreased to $150 million from $165 million. In relation to sales, it was 5.4% this year, down from 7.1% last year. Free cash flow was $297 million, about the same as last year. Our full year operating cash flow was $982 million, a new record for the company. Full year capital expenditures net in relation to sales was virtually unchanged at 5.4%. Free cash flow for the full year improved year-over-year by $186 million to $414 million. Our cash conversion, defined as free cash flow in relation to net income was 85%. Now looking on our trade working capital development on the next slide. During the fourth quarter, trade working capital decreased by $71 million, driven by $120 million higher accounts payables, partly offset by $30 million higher inventories and by $19 million in higher receivables. The higher inventories and receivables were mainly due to the higher sales. Our capital efficiency program aims to improve working capital by $800 million and to-date we have achieved $580 million. Improvements in receivables and especially in inventories are lagging due to the high call of volatility and hence planning changes resulting in inefficiencies. We expect this to improve significantly in tandem with reduced call of volatility over coming years. Now looking at shareholder returns over the past five years on the next slide. Over the years, Autoliv has shown its ability to generate solid cash flow in periods with difficult market environments, such as COVID lockdowns, the war in Ukraine, industry supply chain challenges, and related volatile and declining light vehicle production. We have used both dividend payments and share repurchases to create shareholder value. Historically, the dividend has usually represented a yield of approximately 2% to 3% in relation to the average share price. Over the last five years, we have reduced the net debt significantly, while returning almost $1.4 billion directly to shareholders. This includes stock repurchases of 5.1 million shares for a total of US$467 million as part of the current stock repurchase program. Since we initiated the stock repurchase program, we have reduced the number of outstanding shares by almost 6%. We do consider several factors when executing the program, such as our balance sheets, the cash flow outlook, our credit rating and the general business conditions and not only the debt leverage ratio. We always strive to balance what is best for our shareholders both short- and long-term. Now looking on our leverage ratio development on the next slide. Despite increased stock repurchases and higher dividends, the debt leverage ratio at the end of December 2023 improved to 1.2 times from 1.3 times at the end of the third quarter. This was a result of $108 million higher 12-month trailing adjusted EBITDA as the net debt was unchanged. We expect that our debt leverage and positive cash flow trend will allow for continued high shareholder returns going forward. I now hand it back to you, Mikael.\nMikael Bratt: Thank you, Fredrik. On to the next slide. After a year where the global outdoor industry finally reached pre-pandemic levels, 2024 is shaping up to be something of a transitional year. With many regions having already rebuilt inventories, S&P continues to see a production outlook that is more reliant on the end customer demand. Globalized vehicle production is projected to decline by close to 1% in 2024. This is due to affordability of new vehicles, somewhat softer interest in EVs in some regions and high interest rates. Most of the expected decline is in Japan and Europe. S&P Global expects first half year global light vehicle production to increase by 1%, while the second half declining almost 3% compared to last year. Light vehicle production in China continues to be supported by strong EV demand and export activity. In North America, the UAW strike and the strong vehicle sales towards the end of 2023 have reduced inventories somewhat, bolstering production volumes slightly for 2024. Production in Europe is expected to decline, as inventory restocking will no longer boost output, as was the case over the last two years. We base our full year sales indication on a global light vehicle production decline of around 1%. Now looking on the next slide. In 2023, the main cost challenges were around labor, cost inflation and energy. For 2024, we expect inflation mainly to impact labor costs for us and for our suppliers. We estimate the combined labor exposure, our own and our suppliers, represents more than 40% of our cost base. Already during 2023, the tight labor market in some countries resulted in significantly higher than normal labor inflation. For 2024, we foresee further headwinds from wage increases, especially in Europe and North America. Although, many commodity indices are down since their peak in 2022, we currently assume raw material costs to only decline slightly in 2024. The reason being that the prices of specific raw material used in our products, such as automotive-grade steel, has not declined as much as the generic steel indices indicate. Additionally, we see higher costs for some material, such as yarn and resin. The Red Sea situation has not yet had any measurable impact on our own operations. We have noticed that some customers have reduced their volume short-term, but it is too early to estimate what potential impact it may have for 2024. Cost compensation negotiations will again be challenging, but nevertheless, we expect that price adjustments and other compensation will offset cost inflation. Looking at the 2024 business outlook on the next slide, we expect a significant improvement in adjusted operating margin in 2024 compared to 2023, supported mainly by organic sales growth, a more stable light vehicle production, structural and strategic initiative, cost control and customer compensation. We expect the adjusted operating margin in the first quarter to be around 7%, a significant decline from the fourth quarter in 2023 due to lower light vehicle production, lower engineering income, cost inflation and timing of cost compensation. This is in line with the seasonality in the past two years. We anticipate price adjustments and cost compensations will gradually throughout the year, offset cost inflation and the pattern is expected to be similar to the quarterly pattern seen in 2022 and 2023, with limited positive effects in the first quarter. This trajectory should be further supported by improvement from strict cost control, structural savings, as well as expected gradual improvement of the supply chain and light vehicle production stability. Looking at our 2024 financial guidance on the next slide. This slide shows our full year 2024 guidance, which excludes costs and gains from capacity alignment, antitrust related matters and other discrete items. Our full year guidance is based on a light vehicle production decline of around 1%. Despite lower light vehicle production, our organic sales is expected to increase by around 5%. No net currency translation effects are expected on sale. The guidance for adjusted operating margin is around 10.5%. Operating cash flow is expected to be around US$1.2 billion. Our positive cash flow trend should allow for continued high shareholder returns. We foresee a tax rate of around 28% in line with our previous indications of 25% to 30% as the new normal tax rate. Looking to our sustainability approach on the next slide. Guided by our vision of saving more lives, our mission is to provide world-class life-saving solutions for mobility and society. Sustainability is an integral part of our business strategy and an important driver for market differentiation and stakeholder value creation, helping to ensure that our business will continue to thrive and contribute to sustainable development in the long-term. Our sustainability approach is based on four focus areas, saving more lives, safe and inclusive workplace, climate and responsible business, each consisting of long-term ambitions and more specific short-term targets. Our sustainability approach is anchored in well-established international frameworks such as the UN Global Compact and Science Based Targets. We aim to be carbon neutral in our own operation by 2030 and further aim for net zero emissions across our supply chain by 2040. These ambitions place Autoliv among the front runners in the broader group of automotive suppliers. Now looking at the sustainability progress in 2023 on the next slide. During 2023, we initiated and concluded a number of activities that highlight our commitment and contribution to the UN Sustainable Development Goals and our own sustainability targets. For example, we are the fore -- we are at the forefront of broadening test models to include more body shapes and parameters such as age and gender. We have increased the use of renewable electricity, contributing to a significant decrease in greenhouse gas emissions from our own operations. The incidence rates have improved and we carried out our annual climate survey at direct material suppliers to track their alignment with our climate requirements and ambitions. Turning the slide to look at progress towards our targets. In the medium-term, we are expecting to continue to grow our core business, airbags, seatbelts and steering wheels, through execution on the current strong order books. The other important growth driver is safety content per vehicle, which is driven by continuous updates of government, regulation and crash test rating. Our growth target for the three years, 2022, 2023 and 2024, was to grow organically by around four percentage points, more than light vehicle production growth per year on average. This excludes any price compensation for raw material and other inflationary costs. The growth in 2022 and 2023 and the guidance for 2024 means that we expect to exceed these targets. To maintain the growth momentum beyond 2024, we are pursuing an ambitious innovation program. The strong 2023 order intake supports continued growth momentum. Now looking on the multiple levers for modern improvements on the next slide. In the past two years, Autoliv has significantly reduced its cost base. We have implemented hundreds of cost efficiency projects, especially in production and supply chain. Our adjusted operating margin target of around 12% is based on the framework communicated at our Investor Day in June 2023, a business environment with a stable global light vehicle production of at least $85 million and that headwinds from inflation is offset through price compensations. We remain confident that when these conditions are met for the full year, we are capable to reach the 12% adjusted operating margin target. We now expect that the light vehicle production conditions will be fulfilled during 2024. We expect that call of volatility through 2024 will be lower than in 2023, but remain higher than the pre-pandemic level, having a negative impact on our productivity and efficiency. We expect continued inflationary pressure in 2024 with customer compensations lagging behind the cost increases. To offset the negative effects from inflation and market conditions, and to secure our long-term competitiveness, we have launched a number of cost-saving activities. We believe that the net effect of our actions and headwinds should result in a substantial step in 2024 towards our adjusted operating margin targets. Now looking on delivering shareholder value through our 2024 business agenda on the next slide. To drive towards our financial targets and deliver shareholder value, the health and safety of our employees is our first priority. While continuing more activities to further improve quality and efficiency. We also continue our efforts of flawless execution of new launches, improving customer satisfaction further and thereby supporting our new and strong market position. Through our capital efficiency program, we aim to unlock capital from receivables, inventory and payables. Combined with the execution of our strategic plan, this should lead to a strong cash flow generation, which sets Autoliv up for attractive shareholder value creation. By executing on our strategic initiatives, footprint optimization and negotiating compensation from OEMS, we believe we will mitigate headwinds from cost inflation. To progress towards our climate targets, we will focus on increased resource efficiency and reduction of carbon footprint. I will now hand it back to Anders.\nAnders Trapp: Thank you, Mikael. Turning to the last page, this concludes our formal comments for today\u2019s earnings call and we would like to open the line for questions from analysts and investors. I now hand it back to you Nadia.\nOperator: Thank you so much. [Operator Instructions] And now we\u2019re going to take our first question and it comes from Colin Langan from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please ask your question.\nColin Langan: Oh! Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just looking at the -- you comment on this a bit. Your long-term target is 4% over market. The guidance implies about 6%, I think, it\u2019s 5% to 6%. Any reason why it\u2019s so strong this year and maybe is that including some of the inflationary cost recoveries that you\u2019re expecting? I know that was a bit of a help last year and any thoughts on the China headwind you called out in the quarters, is that also kind of going to continue?\nMikael Bratt: Thank you for your questions there. The 4% outperformance versus LVP takes us into 2024. So this is the last year of the three-year period that we have communicated on, and as we said there, we expect to over deliver on that target. And of course, it is thanks to the growth we have created through the order intake over the last couple of years, and of course, we have seen a good development on the content per week and also -- and we expect to see that also next year. This excluded, as we mentioned here, also the price negotiations that is on top of that. Then beyond 2024, we have the 4% to 6%, where the core -- 4% to 6% organic growth targets where the current, let\u2019s say, core business should be 2% to 4%. So that is our target going there beyond 2024. Regarding China, the minus 2% versus LVP we saw in the fourth quarter is due to mixed effects. As we mentioned here, we had growth -- significant growth on the low-end vehicles, or let\u2019s say, the vehicles with lower safety content than usual. But if you look at the full year, we had a very strong outperformance there of 8% for the full year. So we look very positively on China and we feel that we are well-positioned with, let\u2019s say, the new EV players and also the OEMs in general there. So positive view on China going forward.\nColin Langan: Got it. And any color on, you called out labor inflation again with other questions. Any way to frame how large this is in terms of dollars or the impact that\u2019s dragging your margins this year?\nFredrik Westin: Yeah. I mean, we expect it to be about the same level as we had last year, which where we said would be somewhere mid-single-digit above normal inflation, so pre-2023, basically and we\u2019re also giving some breakdown here on the slides on the labor cost of our percent of sales. So with that, you can calculate what the impact is and that\u2019s the major inflation we\u2019re expecting. Then on top of that, we also expect some energy increases based as a surcharge on materials that we\u2019re buying especially on textiles. So those are the main two components.\nColin Langan: Got it. All right. Thanks for taking my questions.\nMikael Bratt: Thank you.\nFredrik Westin: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Now we\u2019re going to take our next question. Just give us a moment. And the next question comes from Giulio Pescatore from BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Exane. Your line is open. Please ask your question.\nGiulio Pescatore: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. The first one on the buyback. Just wondering if you\u2019ll be comfortable getting closer to the upper end of the leverage range in 2024, especially considering a further uplifting margin potentially in 2025 and the good cash flow generation you expect for this year. Then the second question on inflation and compensation. You mentioned that you expect full compensation for costs. Does that mean at the end of the year, so we shouldn\u2019t expect full compensation on 2024 as a whole, but by the end of the year, you think you can have full compensation with potentially some slippage in the first few months. Is that a fair way to describe it? Thank you.\nMikael Bratt: Thank you for your questions there. On the buybacks, as you know, we only report on what we have done on a regular basis here through our webpage here. We are, I mean, very committed to our program that we have and I think you can see that we have in the fourth quarter here a healthy level of buybacks, and the -- of course, we are focusing a lot on making sure that we have the cash flow generation needed, and as you see from the report here, we are committed to be a shareholder friendly company when it comes to both the regular dividend and also to the buyback program and we will come back on that as we progress here. But that\u2019s as much as I could say here today. Regarding the inflationary, there is a lead time, and as we have indicated here already, you see, let\u2019s say, the cost effect from inflation hitting us earlier in the year and then we have the negotiation throughout the year. And in the same fashion as we were stating last year, our focus here is to get the full compensation and the height of the compensation rather than to looking at the quarter-by-quarter here. So it\u2019s the full year compensation that is the priority and the height of it. So therefore you get this, let\u2019s say, new seasonality, if we call it that, where you have obviously Q1 and then gradually improve throughout the year. So that\u2019s the reason behind that. I don\u2019t know, Anders, if you would like to add anything there, Fredrik, or?\nFredrik Westin: No. Well, in overall, our expectations, we should be compensated also for the full year effect and that was also the case in 2023. Whereas 2022 with the raw material compensation, there was a component that we were not compensated for in 2022. Hence there was a carryover effect into 2023, but we don\u2019t expect that same pattern for 2024.\nGiulio Pescatore: Okay. Very clear. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Now we\u2019re going to take our next question. And the next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please ask your question.\nEmmanuel Rosner: Thank you very much. My first question I was hoping to ask you about, could you comment a little bit more about your path towards the 12% reiterated operating margin target? I very much appreciate the scorecard that you put at the end of the slide deck. So if I\u2019m understanding it correctly, it looks like production is probably in the right level at least. Maybe cost recovery sort of like offset by some of your cost reduction programs. So is the main impediment to getting to your targets the co-op accuracy, and if so, I guess, what is the line of sight? Is it fair to assume that this will normalize or are there further actions that you need to get you to the target?\nMikael Bratt: Okay. I mean, there are a lot of components in your question. So, overall, the framework is I think pretty clear. $85 million we say -- as it looks right now, 2024, $85 million seems to be in place as an assumption here for 2024. Then when it comes to the other two that we are made whole on the inflation compensation, that will potentially have an impact also on a full year as long as we have inflation and there\u2019s always this catch up effect from when the costs come in until we are compensated for. Again, here, our ambition is to have that also in place for 2024, but that remains to be seen also how inflation develops during the year. Then the last component is on call of stability and here we have a graph in our presentation where it\u2019s clearly not in place going into the year. I mean, we have seen it kind of temp or stabilizing at around 90% now during the second half of last year. We are not assuming it right now that this will improve significantly during 2024. And then there\u2019s also even if it were to come up to pre-pandemic levels, closer to the 100%, there\u2019s also a time lag of when that accuracy is actually in place until we can also get the efficiency out in our network. So it\u2019s -- yeah, it\u2019s trending towards the framework, but for sure 2024 will not be in place and it remains to be seen how much of that number two and three here will come in place during 2024 and then what the impact is for 2025. Looking at the building blocks of how to get from the 8.8% that we had now in 2023 up to the 12%, it\u2019s roughly, you can divide it into three buckets. One is the structural initiatives and the headcount reductions. The second one is the volatility improvement combined with the labor productivity development. And then the third component is sales growth and our strategic initiatives and it\u2019s roughly, I would say, one-third margin contribution from those three buckets.\nEmmanuel Rosner: That is great color. Thank you. So let me just hone in for my second question on the sales growth piece of it. As we look past this year and towards some of your targets. I think we started in the past, you had reported sometimes on your annual win rate and oftentimes they were at like 50% or better. Obviously, your market share, you reported that it\u2019s 45%. What is your -- can you comment on the win rate and I guess what is the confidence level in being able to capture additional market share over the next few years beyond the 2024 framework?\nMikael Bratt: Yeah. As you know, we have since last year communicated here around the lifetime revenue on the order intake and I think we had a very good 2023 and the highest in five years here in terms of lifetime revenue. And what we are saying here is that, we reached the 45% market share in 2023, which we have indicated since some years back that that was what we expected us to grow into, and with the order intake and order book we have, we expect to defend this market share. We do not have, I would say, a target or an ambition to set a new level of our market share here. It is really to defend this market share position with healthy business, of course. If we can grow more in a healthy way, of course, we will do it. But it is not the target in itself. So the growth that we expect going forward, the 2% to 4%, as I talked about, and we have announced earlier beyond 2024 is connected to light vehicle production and content with more sophisticated products.\nEmmanuel Rosner: Thank you very much.\nMikael Bratt: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Now we\u2019re going to take over the next question. Just give us a moment. And the next question comes to line of Michael Jacks from Bank of America Securities. Your line is open. Please ask your question.\nMichael Jacks: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. First one just on price recoveries. Some other suppliers have struggled to secure compensation for wage inflation and Autoliv has clearly been more successful. Is there anything structural you could point towards that gives you the confidence that you can achieve the same in 2024? And then second question is just on working capital, what is the magnitude of improvement expected in 2024 in relation to the remaining gap of $120 million to the $8 billion reduction target that you have in mind? Thank you.\nMikael Bratt: Thank you. Let me start with the price recovery, and Fredrik will comment on the working capital there. But on the price recovery, I can\u2019t say there\u2019s a structural to it. I think it\u2019s -- I mean, of course, I can only comment on what we are doing here and we have now for the last two years have had very constructive dialogues with our customers around the over and above normal cost increases we see in the system here. And I mean we\u2019re starting out with raw materials and there we have also mentioned that we have made some indication, a higher level of indexation to those contracts here also. So I mean it works both ways obviously. So when we see that come down we will also hand that back to our customers. When it comes to the other components here, it\u2019s a little bit different to its nature, but I think, it\u2019s very important to get compensation for what is the inflationary components here and we -- for this year definitely have the labor in focus here. And I mean that\u2019s the nature of inflation, it needs to be passed on into the end consumer here and meaning the price of the car at the end of the day. So we need to push that on, because there is no possibility for us to compensate our suppliers unless we get the pass on here. It\u2019s not sustainable and that\u2019s something we just need to continue to work hard with and we will do that and that\u2019s our focus here going forward as well.\nFredrik Westin: And then, Michael, on your second question, working capital. Yeah, so we reported here that we have achieved around $580 million of the $800 million target that we set ourselves. In the $800 million target, we had also detailed that around $500 million of that would come from improved payables and that we have achieved or even overachieved already to-date. So we don\u2019t expect more to be contributed from that component. So the inventory is challenging right now due to the call of volatility as we show here that it\u2019s kind of stabilizing at still to the poor levels. And as I mentioned, we don\u2019t expect this to improve significantly during 2024. And accordingly, we do not expect that we will be able to do so much on the inventory side either in 2024. And we do not guide for working capital specifically, but you see a very strong operating cash flow guidance here of $1.2 billion. But there is then more opportunity coming later from improving working capital further.\nMichael Jacks: That\u2019s very clear. Thank you.\nFredrik Westin: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Now we\u2019re going to take our next question. Just a moment, please. And the question comes from Hampus Engellau from Handelsbanken. Your line is open. Please ask your question.\nHampus Engellau: Yeah. Two questions for me. Despite and it\u2019s the good questions, but I\u2019m curious about the drop in Active Seatbelt sales during the quarter minus 11% given the big spread to the LVP that increased by more than 9%. If you don\u2019t have, we can take that later. But that -- it\u2019s just by curiosity. I mean, I\u2019m sorry to come back on this cost inflation, because I\u2019m trying to understand the dynamics here. I can definitely see that the OEMs are retroactively compensating you guys for rising costs in the quarters. But on the labor side, could you maybe give us some more detail on how those negations are going, given that those cost savings are quite permanent and sticky and are you guys getting compensated retroactively for these also and well how does the process work? Thanks.\nMikael Bratt: I think on the Active Seatbelts side it\u2019s no drama in into that, of course, you get mixed effects also in specific years where you have maybe some outgoing car models where you have a high level of in this case than Active Seatbelt and my expectation here is that you should see that recovery recovering in the next year here or so. So no drama to that, it\u2019s more of a, yeah, temporary mix effect. And then on the cost compensation here if I understand you right. I mean the nature of OEMs, as you said labor cost increases is sticky and therefore it\u2019s, I mean, it will not come down, I think we can call it. So of course there is an absolute necessity that that inflationary component has to come through. There is no room for anything else and that is what we are doing here and we of course have very detailed supporting documents to when we go to our customers how that\u2019s connected to their specific business and how it\u2019s correlated. So that\u2019s something we need to go through and I mean we went through that partly already last year when we saw in some cases and in some regions that impact already in 2023. So we expect to do more of that.\nHampus Engellau: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Now we\u2019re going to take our next question. Just give us a moment. And our question comes to land of Bjorn Enarson from Danske Bank. Your line is open. Please ask your question.\nBjorn Enarson: Thank you. I have a question also on price. I mean you have been very successful in getting compensation, but also we have seen, I mean, OEMs coming from high profitability, and as I said you mentioned yourself, we need to see inflation coming to the price of the cars, but we\u2019ve also seen price cuts on cars we also seen OEMs reporting lower profitability and accepting perhaps a lower profitability as they are investing in price in a way. Is this a situation that impacts some suppliers in general or how has it been in the past? That\u2019s my first question.\nMikael Bratt: Thank you. Thank you, Bjorn. No. I think, I see what you\u2019re referring to here. But I mean, it -- first of all, it has never been easy these negotiations, not even when we saw record profitability at the OEMs. And I think the point from my side here is that that\u2019s nothing to do with their profitability or our possibility. This is inflation that needs to be passed on. It\u2019s not sustainable for us to pay our suppliers unless we can get the pass-through. So that is just something that we are very firm on and needs to continue to be firm on. There is no other way uh than that. Then I think when you look at the price reductions and so on at the towards the end consumers. I think there is of course different reasons for that you see those prices coming down, which probably is more on an individual basis between the OEMs, so I have no comments around that, but we need to focus on our business here, which we are doing, so just to continue to press on there.\nBjorn Enarson: And just to follow up and perhaps in the past we have not really seen a correlation between car prices and your price negotiations. I mean you have your negotiations with the team at your customers and then there are other teams setting the price for on the actual cars or is there a correlation?\nMikael Bratt: No. I mean, not from our perspective it\u2019s no correlation and I think that\u2019s my point here that they need, I mean, each company take care of their business and in our case here we need to get compensation for the inflation in our system, which includes ours.\nBjorn Enarson: Got it. And one more thing, I mean, last year I would like to remember that you had an outlook that was based on an LVP a little bit below what was in the market back then or by S&P and now you\u2019re in in line with that. And last year we also saw this catch up driven sales and now it\u2019s more, as you highlight, more in line with the market. Is there a nervousness on where the market will end up when you are talking to your customers or people in the industry? As we are maybe heading into more of a slowdown or more, more visible this year than last year?\nMikael Bratt: No. I think, I mean, at least from the dialogues we have with our customers on the way forward here, I don\u2019t see any discrepancies to what we refer to here as the minus one from S&P Global in general here. I think there is more of this mix effect between ICE and EVs and -- especially in Europe where maybe the EVs is slowing down somewhat, but it\u2019s more a mixed effect there. And for us that is neutral, because as you know, we are well represented in both categories and we are agnostic to the driveline question here, so we don\u2019t see the effect on our end here.\nBjorn Enarson: Sure. Very good. Thank you.\nMikael Bratt: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Dear participants due to time we are not taking any further questions. I would like now to hand the conference over to Mikael Bratt for any closing remarks.\nMikael Bratt: Thank you very much, Nadia. I am confident that we will deliver a substantial increase in sales, operating cash flow and adjusted operating income in 2024, while maintaining substantial shareholder return. Our actions are creating both short-term and long-term improvements, and we believe these actions enable us to take important steps towards our targets, while we remain agile and prepare for more adverse market development, should that be necessary. Autoliv continues to focus on our vision of saving more lives, which is our most important direct contribution to a sustainable society. Our first quarter earnings call is scheduled for Friday, April 26, 2024. Thank you everyone for participating in today\u2019s call. We sincerely appreciate your continued interest in Autoliv. Until next time stay safe.\nOperator: That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for participating. You may now all disconnect. Have a nice day.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor. For more information see our T&C."

Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions with instructions to follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Steve Crockett, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of South Plains Financial. Mr. Crockett, please go ahead, sir.\nSteven Crockett: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your participation in our earnings conference call. With me here today are Curtis Griffith, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Cory Newsom, our President; and Brent Bates, our Chief Credit Officer. The related earnings press release and earnings presentation are available on the News & Events section of our website spfi.bank. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that this call may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated future results. Please see our Safe Harbor statement in our earnings press release or on slide two of the earnings presentation. All comments made during today's call are subject to those Safe Harbor statements. Any forward-looking statements presented herein are made only as of today's date, and we do not undertake any duty to update such forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Additionally, during today's call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe are useful in evaluating our performance. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures can also be found in our earnings release and in the earnings presentation. Curtis, let me hand it over to you.\nCurtis Griffith: Thank you, Steve, and good morning. On today's call, I will briefly review the highlights of our full year 2023 results as well as provide an update on our capital allocation priorities. Cory will discuss our loan portfolio as well as our initiatives to drive deposit and fee income growth in the year ahead. Steve will then conclude with a more detailed review of our fourth quarter financial results. I would like to start by thanking our employees for their efforts and commitment to both the bank and our customers during an extremely challenging year for our industry. Our success would not be possible without their dedication and hard work. As shown on slide four of our earnings presentation, we delivered 9.7% loan growth for the full year driven by the expansion of our lending platform, combined with a resilient economy as Texas continues to benefit from in-migration and a favorable business climate. If inflation continues to moderate and the Federal Reserve begins to reduce their benchmark interest rate, we expect economic growth to accelerate as we look to the second half of 2024. Looking back at the past year, our community-based deposit franchise grew modestly, which is impressive given the significant dislocation that occurred following the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and  Signature Bank  (OTC:SBNY) in the first quarter. For the full year, our core deposits grew 1%, excluding brokered deposits to $3.26 billion, which demonstrates the resilience of our franchise combined with our strong customer relationships. At quarter-end, 81% of our deposits were in our rural markets with 19% in our major metropolitan markets of Dallas, Houston and El Paso. Additionally, our average deposit account balance is approximately $36,000 with only an estimated 16% of our total deposits being uninsured or uncollateralized. The credit quality of our loan portfolio also remained strong through the fourth quarter as our classified loans have remained at the lowest level since the start of the pandemic as we ended the year. Lastly, we increased our return on average assets to 1.54% for the full year 2023 as compared with 1.47% for the full year 2022. We also completed the sale of our Windmark Crop Insurance subsidiary in April for a pre-tax gain of $33.8 million. The gain that we recorded positioned us to strategically sell $56 million of investment securities at a loss in a tax-efficient manner and reinvest those proceeds into higher-yielding loans. Given our strong capital and liquidity position, our Board of Directors authorized a $15 million stock repurchase program in May, which has been exhausted. We repurchased 218,000 shares in the fourth quarter and a total of 686,000 shares during 2023. Through the year, our Board has believed that our shares have traded below intrinsic value, and we have been aggressive buying our stock in the open market. Looking to the year ahead, we will maintain our liquidity and continue to watch for opportunities to expand the bank and our earnings power. M&A is an area of interest and we believe you will see transactions take place in the market as sellers' expectations are becoming more realistic. The decline in interest rates at the end of the year also led to a recovery in bank securities portfolios, which will increase the probability that we will see deal volumes pick up. However, we will only be interested in acquiring the bank with the right culture, excess liquidity, a stable deposit base and at a valuation that makes sense for us and our shareholders. In the meantime, we remain focused on organic growth while returning a steady stream of income to our shareholders through our quarterly dividend. Our Board of Directors again authorized a $0.13 per share quarterly dividend as announced last week. This will be our 19th consecutive quarterly dividend to be paid on February 12th, 2024 for shareholders of record on January 29th, 2024. Now I'll turn the call over to Cory.\nCory Newsom: Thank you, Curtis, and hello, everyone. Starting on slide six, loans held for investment increased $20.6 million or 2.8% annualized as compared to the linked quarter. Loan demand was primarily in commercial real estate during the quarter and was partially offset by an approximate $10 million decline in our indirect auto portfolio. As we've said on previous calls, we're carefully managing our indirect auto portfolio with a focus on maintaining the portfolio's credit quality while reinvesting a portion of the monthly principal amortization into higher-yielding loans. The yield on our loan portfolio was 6.29% in the fourth quarter as compared to 6.1% in the linked quarter. We continue to price new loans to account for the higher interest rate environment that we are operating in combined with the upward pressure on our deposit costs. Skipping to slide eight, we grew loans by $44 million or 17.8% annualized to $1.04 billion in our major metropolitan markets of Dallas, Houston and El Paso as compared to the linked quarter. Our metro markets continue to be an important source of loan growth and more than offset the paydowns that we experienced in our community markets as well as the expected decline in our indirect auto portfolio. We remain in a hiring mode as we look for good lenders who fit our culture and can bring new business to the bank though we'll remain extremely selective. Turning to slide nine. Demand across our markets remains healthy as we continue to experience solid economic growth, though we continue to be selective in who we do business with and what loans we underwrite. As a result, we expect low single-digit loan growth for 2024, though we expect to continue to deliver interest income growth as many lower rate loans continue to experience principal repayments and/or rate resets. While we expect the majority of this repricing to begin accelerating in the second half of 2024, we believe loan yields will remain elevated, even if the Fed begins to cut interest rates given lower liquidity in the market which will benefit our net interest income, NIM, in the third and fourth quarters. In conjunction with our effort to drive loan growth, we also need to deliver deposit growth while stabilizing our noninterest-bearing deposit balances. Though our lenders have always had an emphasis on deposits as part of their incentive comp plan, we have brought a renewed focus on the type and value of these deposits. More specifically, true core deposits and noninterest-bearing balances now carry more weight in these plans. Better said, we are focused on the profitability of the whole relationship. We're also getting much better at putting in loan covenants to new loan originations centered on deposit requirements and liquidity maintenance agreements. While we've always targeted this, we're getting much better negotiating these covenants. Treasury management is another area where we have made real progress as we've improved our team, our product and our capabilities over the last year. During the fourth quarter, we recruited a senior treasury management executive from a top seven US bank to head this business, which follows several additions to our team as we improve the talent of this group. I'm so excited with the level of people and product that we have today, which is unmatched in our history. We're also doing a better job than we ever have in making sure we align the right treasury products with the customer's financial needs, thus allowing us to continue to drive both deposit growth and fee income. Turning to slide 11. We generated $9.1 million of noninterest income in the fourth quarter as compared to $12.3 million in the third quarter. This decline was largely due to a $2.9 million decline in mortgage banking revenues, which includes a $2.2 million decline in the fair market value adjustment to our mortgage servicing rights portfolio. Importantly, we've aggressively managed our mortgage banking expense base as volumes have decreased over the last 18 months with a focus on maintaining profitability. While this downturn in mortgage originations has been the most severe in more than three decades, we've experienced negligible lawsuits while maintaining our mortgage capabilities for the eventual turn in volumes as mortgage rates continue to decline. And as I mentioned, we expect our initiatives in treasury management to begin to impact fee income beginning in the second quarter. For the fourth quarter, noninterest income was 21% of bank revenues as compared to 26% in the third quarter of 2023. To conclude, we delivered strong results through the fourth quarter. I believe we will remain well positioned. That said, we're not standing still and are aggressively addressing the current environment to manage deposit cost pressures while accelerating fee income growth. We need to stabilize our noninterest-bearing deposits and grow our deposit franchise in order to position us to take advantage of improving loan demand as we move through 2024. I'm confident that we have the right people and plan, and I'm excited about the opportunities ahead. I will now turn the call over to Steve.\nSteven Crockett: Thanks, Cory. For the fourth quarter, diluted earnings per share was $0.61, which compares to $0.78 per share in the linked quarter. We recorded a $1.5 million write-down at the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights asset during the quarter as compared to a $700,000 write-up in the linked quarter. The current quarter impact on our earnings per share was $0.07 after tax. Turning to slide 13. Net interest income was $35.2 million for the fourth quarter as compared to $35.7 million for the linked quarter. Our loan production in the third quarter, combined with the rise in new loan rates lifted the yield on our loan portfolio by 19 basis points in the fourth quarter, resulting in a $1.7 million increase in loan interest income. The rise in loan interest income was offset by $1.3 million increase in interest expense due to the rise in short-term interest rates on interest-bearing liabilities and a decrease of $900,000 in the income on other interest-earning assets as average investable liquidity declined in the fourth quarter. Our net interest margin calculated on a tax equivalent basis held steady at 3.52% in the fourth quarter as compared to the linked quarter. Higher loan balances and loan yields offset the rise in our cost of deposits and the decline in noninterest-bearing deposits. As outlined on slide 14, our average cost of deposits was 224 basis points in the fourth quarter, an increase of 17 basis points from the linked quarter. Given the rising interest rate environment through the year, we've had to be proactive in maintaining deposit relationships, which has led to the rise in our funding cost. Overall, our core deposit franchise continues to remain steady with only a slight decrease in the fourth quarter. As Cory touched on, we put initiatives in place designed to stabilize our noninterest-bearing deposit balances while also driving core deposit growth. We expect these initiatives to begin to have an impact as we move through 2024. In the meantime, we expect continued upward pressure on deposit costs, which will modestly pressure our NIM. That said, we expect our NIM to trough through the first half of 2024. Turning to slide 15. Our ratio of allowance for credit losses to total loans held for investment was 1.41% at December 31st, 2023, which is unchanged from the end of the prior quarter. We recorded a $600,000 provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter, which was largely attributable to our organic loan growth as well as net charge-off activity in the quarter. Skipping ahead to slide 19. Our noninterest expense was $30.6 million in the fourth quarter as compared to $31.5 million in the linked quarter. The $900,000 decrease was largely due to lower mortgage costs as we continue to manage through the decline in mortgage volumes. That said, we would expect noninterest expense to modestly rise through the first half of 2024 as mortgage volume increase through the spring selling season. Moving ahead to slide 21. We remain well capitalized with tangible common equity to tangible assets of 9.21% at the end of the fourth quarter, an increase from 8.4% at the end of the third quarter of 2023. The increase was largely driven by $32.9 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income or AOCI, and $8.2 million of net income after dividends paid. AOCI was positively impacted by decreases in long-term market interest rates during the fourth quarter. Tangible book value per share increased to $23.47 as of December 31st compared to $21.07 as of September 30th, 2023, largely due to the impact of AOCI in our net earnings in the fourth quarter. I'll turn the call back to Curtis for concluding remarks.\nCurtis Griffith: Thank you, Steve. To conclude, I'm very proud of our performance over the past year. Our community-based deposit franchise remained resilient, while our lenders continue to drive high-quality loan growth that contributed to our strong earnings growth in 2023. We also sold Windmark, which provided capital for share repurchases as well as a strategic reposition of a portion of our securities portfolio. The bank is operating very well as we enter 2024, but we know we have much more to do. As Cory outlined, we have initiatives in place that we believe will stabilize our noninterest-bearing deposit balances, grow core deposits and drive fee income growth. This will provide improved liquidity for loan growth looking to the second half of 2024, when we expect to see a meaningful portion of our loan portfolio reprice and an acceleration in the Texas economy from already healthy levels. We expect competitor liquidity to fund new loans in our markets to be limited and believe we will be well positioned to add high-quality customers and attractive loans to our portfolio. We also expect our fee income to improve starting in the second quarter. We remain optimistic on the year ahead as we focus on delivering value to our shareholders. Thank you again for your time today. Operator, please open the line for any questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Graham Dick from Piper Sandler. Your line is now live.\nGraham Dick: Hey, good morning, guys.\nCurtis Griffith: Good morning, Graham.\nGraham Dick: I just wanted to start on loan growth. I heard your guidance there for low single-digit growth, which I guess, aligns with the last two quarters pretty well, but for the full year 2023, 10% is definitely slower. And then also for you to sort of frame that up with, I guess, what you see between your community markets and in the metro markets because it sounds like, the growth in the metro markets has been pretty strong, which is a little different than some of the metro-focused or headquartered banks in Texas. So I just would like to hear maybe what you are doing differently to grow loans faster there? And then also how the community banking payoffs might play into that low single-digit growth?\nCurtis Griffith: Graham, this is Curtis. Yes. I think a lot of our growth, it's getting -- it's a result of making some great hires that we've done in some of those markets in the last couple of years and all that's kind of coming to fruition. It is still a little more challenging to get the growth out here in some of the more rural markets, but we're seeing good activity, too. I'm going to let Brent Bates to kind of elaborate on that and what he kind of sees going forward a little here in '24.\nBrent Bates: This is Brent. Last year, in '23, we saw a real strong growth in the first half and closer to that 3% second half of the year. And I think what we're expecting this year is still to see some tailwinds from our construction portfolio, advances in the first half of the year on the construction portfolio, which is predominantly multifamily and industrial projects in our metro markets and still see some pullback in residential construction. And then we're still seeing good activity from our existing clients even out in our rural markets. So I think the low single-digit growth for '24 is realistic. It's attainable and definitely '24, I would expect to be much more of a smooth growth period than 2023 was.\nCory Newsom: Graham, this is Cory. I think the other thing we've got to keep in mind is we're being much more selective about what we're wanting to fund. So we've had opportunities to look at a number of transactions that we just passed on. We don't think it's the right time on some of those for us right now or for some of the clients. So we just -- we have selectively pulled back a little bit, and we're okay with that.\nGraham Dick: Yes, definitely makes sense, and that's helpful, Brent. Thanks for that. And I guess just moving to the margin a little bit, it was flat quarter-over-quarter. I know you guys said that you're calling for a trough maybe in the first half of the year. I was wondering if you'd be willing to maybe give an idea of where you see that trough. I mean, is that low 3.40s or is it just slightly below this level? Just trying to get an idea for the trends going forward given we saw flat margin quarter-over-quarter. And it seems like the rate environment should get a little bit better to start the year, but obviously, still very competitive out there.\nSteven Crockett: Yes. Graham, this is Steve. I'll start, and then I'll let Cory or Curtis jump in as well. I mean we were fortunate that we were able to keep it flat during the fourth quarter. We do continue to see pricing pressure, particularly on the deposit side. We did -- while we did increase the cost of deposits during the quarter that rate of growth did slow down, and we're prepared for that to still increase but that overall growth has continued to slow down. Yes, we hope there will be some relief inside depending on what they do with rates, been a little bit of mixed messages in the first three weeks of the year so far, it seems like looking like they're headed down and then kind of pulling back up a little bit, not on ours specifically, but just when you look at the treasury market and some other rates. So we are hopeful that we can keep NIM close to where it is. A little bit of a drop. I hate to put any specific number out there, but I mean, 5 basis point drop, 3 to 5, 3 to 7 or so, something like that would not be unrealistic, but we're going to do everything we can to try to keep it close to where it is today.\nCory Newsom: Graham, I think one thing, though, that this is the first quarter that we felt comfortable to start making minor changes in less sensitive -- less rate-sensitive deposits throughout the company. And so I think that's really says a lot when you start looking at the fact that we finally feel comfortable to start making some minor rate reductions across the board. Those are going to be small and incremental, and it's going to take a while for it to start really showing. But I think that says a lot if you kind of think about the fact that we're finally willing to start doing that.\nGraham Dick: No, absolutely, definitely does. And I guess just stand here with the NIM. So is some of the trough that's going to happen, I guess, the pressure in one half , is that because the fixed rate repricing is weighted towards the back half of the year, Curtis, did I hear that correctly?\nSteven Crockett: We definitely have more of that repricing that will occur as we get to the second half of '24. We have some going along, but it accelerates a lot more as we get to the second half.\nCurtis Griffith: One other point. This is the time of year that our ag loans do pay down. And in the big scheme of things, it's not a significant number, but it does move things a penny or two here and there because most of those operating lines were priced up at current rates, as we went through 2023, and they'll be priced at current rates when they renew and they start drawing up again in '24. But there is a little drop there, and it will be in some of our higher-yielding notes that are out there right now.\nGraham Dick: Okay. Okay. That makes sense. And then the last one is just more housekeeping. I just want to make sure I got the mortgage servicing right adjustments correctly. So you said that there was a $1.5 million mark this quarter -- negative mark compared to last quarter, what was the $700,000 write-up, which is the -- that's the 2.2 number is really the delta between the two quarters, right?\nCory Newsom: Yes. Yes.\nGraham Dick: Okay. All right. I just wanted to make sure I understood that correctly. All right. That's all from me guys. Thank you.\nCurtis Griffith: Thanks, Graham\nCory Newsom: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Brett Rabatin from Hovde Group. Your line is now live.\nBrett Rabatin: Hey, guys. Good morning.\nCurtis Griffith: Good morning.\nCory Newsom: Good morning.\nBrett Rabatin: Wanted to first just talk about the deposit initiatives. And you talked quite a bit about stabilizing DDA. And I know you're hopeful for treasury management to possibly be a part of that. Can you guys maybe go through a little bit on the stabilization of DDA, what that entails in terms of product or strategy? How you're going to achieve that? And then just maybe talk a little bit about the growth of deposits and where you expect that to come from?\nCory Newsom: Yes. So, Brett, good morning. This is Cory. So we've had this conversation. We talked about our sales quite a bit. I mean we'd like to sit here and tell you that, I mean treasury's got a quarter-over-quarter just immediate change. It's not going to happen. You know what I mean? our -- what we're trying to do is an overall initiative that chases the trend long-term and the way that we chase relationships. Lot of it is going to come back specifically around the lending relationships and making sure that we require much more emphasis on the deposit gathering. So historically in the past, our lenders have always -- we've always had deposit a bit of the forefront when we looked at relationships, but we were never as picky about the type of deposits. Now we've really changed that focus in incorporating that into the loan covenants that we have, requiring the full operating accounts, all of the things like that, that really come back around. But when we talked about continuing to step up delivery on the treasury side, I mean, it's real. I mean, we continue to tweak till we get treasury leadership the way we really want it, and we're there. We are continuing to enhance our team. And we're focused on education with our lenders and our staff better than we've ever been. So I mean, it's not a sprint. I mean it's a marathon of one that I think that we're continuing to build it in the right way, but that's the focus of our deposit initiative. I mean we -- it's all day long every day, looking at the value deposits, which ones are sticky, which ones that really do mean core to us, and which ones that will ultimately help us drive profitability in the relationships.\nBrett Rabatin: Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate that. The other thing I wanted to ask about was the expenses going forward. Obviously, they've been managed well the past year and maybe some of that mortgage incentive compensation going down, which should probably revert some this year, but as you indicated, aside from the mortgage piece, are there pressure points inflationary or otherwise that would drive expenses in '24 relative to '23?\nSteven Crockett: Brett, this is Steve. So one other piece that we didn't specifically talk about earlier, but we did previously during the year, some of our technology initiatives that we've been working on during '23, in particular, some of our transition to the cloud is some -- we'll have some increased expenses. Some of that was just being built out and some of it was infrastructure and different things that we would start seeing some more depreciation on during the current year. I mean there's always a little bit of inflationary pressures on some of the other items. I don't think there's a -- I don't think we're looking to drastically increase noninterest expense, absent mortgage, just changing a whole lot as far as volume and production that would warrant that. But outside of that, again, we should be probably closer to the Q3 number. I think we were at about $31.5 million versus $30.6 million. I don't think we'll be quite that high, but fourth quarter was definitely down a little bit more than probably what we'll see on a go-forward basis.\nCory Newsom: This is Cory, though. I think to go along with what Steve was saying, though, I do anticipate the mortgage side actually picking up from the expense number in second half. I mean we're very much getting geared up for that because we are kind of proud of the fact of the way we managed mortgage through the last 18 months. And I mean we basically managed to a net zero. That's been our focus to make sure we could keep capabilities in place but manage the -- keep it nimble like we've always said we would do. Now we feel like that we'll be making sure that we got the right productions in place to really take advantage of the step in the second half of the year.\nBrett Rabatin: Okay. Good color there.\nCurtis Griffith: Brett, this is Curtis. Yes, one more quick point. And again, this is I'm giving you a reason not an excuse. As we have grown our team and added real high-quality people to that, we're doing so in what to me is probably the toughest hardest market for banking talent that I remember in 50 years of doing this, and so to bring the people on that we're doing, which we know is the right thing to do. The personnel cost is going to be what it is to get them and keep them. So there's just a little extra tightness right there that's -- over time, it's still going to generate a lot of good revenue for us. And if we've got to have the right people to do it across all sectors, not just lenders, but it doesn't come cheap, and we're not going to lose sight of it.\nBrett Rabatin: Okay. That's helpful. If I could sneak in one last one. You guys mentioned M&A in the call, and it sounds like you're somewhat optimistic that you'll see some activity and maybe you guys will be able to do a deal that makes sense to add to the platform. Can you guys talk about, from here, some folks' strategy has evolved, they're now looking to maybe buy more rural franchises that are deposit funded versus metro markets. Can you guys just talk about what's your M&A strategy would be from here from a geography perspective and what you'd look for a community bank to bring to your platform?\nCurtis Griffith: Well, I'll stick with what I said. I think in the call, the recorded part right there, that we believe that we know what we're looking for, and that is -- I got a script back in front of me, a bank with the right culture, and that's number one because we're not going to try to make a culture that doesn't look like us fit in. It's -- we've seen too many failures with that. Excess liquidity, a stable deposit base and the valuation that makes sense. Well, you look at excess liquidity and stable deposit base, to me, you're almost by definition in Texas, you're looking at more rural markets. So I think you're quite right. And that's the way some other people are looking now too. For so long, they didn't -- they weren't interested in banks out in smaller communities, and now we've seen that pick up. So, yes, we've had some phone calls. We're going to have a few discussions. We're still not anywhere close to doing a deal. But if the right one comes along, we -- and right one also means the right size in all of that as well, then we believe we've got the capital and we've got the people, and we believe we can make it work. But after watching what we've seen right here in our Lubbock market and the Permian as well, in the past couple of years, we don't want to go down the road of having the kind of difficulties that we've seen from some other acquirers. I'll just leave it at that.\nCory Newsom: Brett, this is Cory. It's kind of interesting though that you talked about the fact that people are starting to recognize the value of some of these rural deposits. We always have. That's the thing that back even when we went public in '19, we had discussions around this. We have always seen the value of the rural deposits. And I think that probably puts us in a better position than a lot of the other ones that are just kind of changing their focus and looking at it. But I do think that we're very good at it and we're very focused on being community-minded when we lead some of these rural markets.\nCurtis Griffith: If you're going to have do well in those smaller markets, you really have to understand that you have to be the hometown bank, no matter where your headquarters are, and that's always been our philosophy in all of our smaller markets.\nBrett Rabatin: Okay, great. That's really helpful. Thanks for all the color.\nCurtis Griffith: Thanks, Brett.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Joe Yanchunis from Raymond James. Your line is now live. Joe, perhaps your phone is on mute. Joe from Raymond James, your line is now live. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Mark Shutley from KBW. Your line is now live.\nMark Shutley: Hey, guys. Good morning.\nCurtis Griffith: Good morning, Mark.\nMark Shutley: So on the buyback, I know you guys continued that this quarter and sort of finished the current authorization. Do you still favor the buyback as sort of near the top of the list as far as priorities for '24. And do you expect a new authorization coming?\nCurtis Griffith: It's going to be a decision by the Board. I think clearly, we were doing the right thing at the time in '23. We'll take a hard look at it. In fact, it will probably be discussed in our February Board meeting. And we'll decide where we think we ought to be for the year. As long as we have the capital levels that we do, if we collectively think we're trading at a level that makes that a good investment for our shareholders' money, then yes, I think we'll reauthorize and have something out there. But right now today, I can't give you any real firm metrics on it, but it is going to be a topic of discussion for sure. Obviously, I guess in terms of priorities on things, we're going to be sure we have plenty of capital for organic growth because we do think we'll get a chance to do some during the year. And we're going to keep paying a steady dividend. And if a deal came along for M&A, we'd want to know we've got to the dry powder to do that. But right in there, it's about that same tier is buyback of our existing shares. And as long as we think it's a good value for the money, we're not going to be bashful about doing it.\nMark Shutley: Great. That's helpful. And maybe just one for Steve. Apologies if I missed this, but when you think about the NIM for 2024. What are the rate cut assumptions that you all are using when you think about those margin projections.\nSteven Crockett: Yes. So right now, and again, it's a moving target. But as of right now, we've kind of just got two rate cuts baked in at this point, in the first quarter, early second quarter would be kind of the first one and then later, I think end of third quarter, first of the fourth quarter is when we've got the second one. So again, that's -- the viewpoint on that can shift day-to-day sometimes, but I know some people have got more up to maybe four [Technical Difficulty], but at this point, we're just kind of baking in two.\nMark Shutley: Got it. Thanks. That's it for me guys. Appreciate it.\nSteven Crockett: Thanks, Mark.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Joe Yanchunis from Raymond James. Your line is now live.\nJoseph Yanchunis: Good morning. Sorry about that, are you able to hear me?\nSteven Crockett: Hi, Joe.\nCurtis Griffith: Yes, Joe. We can. Go ahead.\nJoseph Yanchunis: Perfect. So just kind of piggyback off that rate question, what's your model sensitivity to a 25 basis point rate cut? And as we think about that, what kind of deposit betas are you assuming on the way down?\nSteven Crockett: So I'll start here. I mean, as far as 25 basis point decline. I don't have the 25 here in front of me, but we definitely are liability sensitive. But we do -- on the deposit side, we've got about -- we've got about 20, I'd say, close to 20% of the deposit book that is tied to the short-term rate that would reprice down most of that full 25 basis point decline within 30 days or so. The majority of our public fund book and our brokered deposits and then some of the other indexed accounts that we've got at a -- for the full 1% drop, I think we're about a 3 -- around a 3% increase to net interest income, sorry, I don't have those down to the 25 basis point level.\nCurtis Griffith: This is Curtis, Joe, one of the things that will be helpful for us on this is we have continued to be very reluctant on increasing our CD balances out there. We haven't been running any specials or any of that. So the bulk of our deposits are in transaction accounts and we will be able to adjust those rates fairly quickly. Another factor we talked -- touched on treasury management, one that we can and will certainly move because you can move it in very small increments as our earnings credit rate. To the extent that we're using that to the treasury management side, we'll certainly be aggressive in trying to adjust those as rates in fact do decline.\nJoseph Yanchunis: Perfect. I appreciate that. And last one for me here. As asset qualities, it's remained pretty strong throughout the December quarter. So as we think about this next year, is there a potential if we move through the year and we hit the soft landing that we could start to see some reserve relief for you, which would be somewhat of a tailwind. Just kind of curious your thoughts of kind of provisioning year-over-year in the credit outlook.\nBrent Bates: Joe, this is Brent. We're still seeing, I mean, past dues normalizing and occasional credits that have deteriorated. We're just working hard. I mean it's where we wound up at the end of the quarter was because of the work we accomplished during the quarter of exiting some, repairing some, downgrading a few. So we're still seeing some activity coming in and out of there. And I think it kind of really all depends on the long-term effect of the rate rise and how that moves through the economy and we still are modeling in our model, having some more stress than we have today in the overall economy. If we don't see that at some point in time, of course, we're going to reassess it. But right now, we're still kind of thinking, there's still a chance of a little bit of volatility in the overall economy. So when we, I guess, move away from that thinking process, there's a potential we would see some reversal out of there.\nCory Newsom: I think if you start seeing from our standpoint, we see enough rate relief. Our volume is going to pick up enough that we're probably going to offset that pretty quickly from a growth standpoint. So while we -- I would say this. While we would like to see relief in that, we are not dependent upon that for the -- where we're trying to drive earnings.\nCurtis Griffith: I think you can count on us always leaning on the conservative side about what's in that reserve. It just lets everybody sleep a little better at night. And there are metrics that do justify it. We're just -- we're not seeing huge difficulties in our portfolio. But as Brent said, when we spot something, we start working it right then. We don't let problems fester because that usually doesn't end well. So we will stay as conservative as reasonably possible, I would say, in keeping the reserve in there. If the mathematics really do indicate we need to pull some out, we will. But as Cory said, the hope is that we get enough additional organic growth moving into '24 that it will use up any adjustments that would be related to the overall improvement in the economy. And purely speaking for myself, there's still a lot of unknowns out there and one of them is we got an election coming this November. And I don't know what the world is going to look like after that. So we're going to just err on the cautious side.\nCory Newsom: Joe, you know we're conservative and we're always going to underpromise and over-deliver whenever we can.\nJoseph Yanchunis: Got it. All right. Well, I appreciate you taking my questions. Thank you.\nCurtis Griffith: Thanks, Joe.\nCory Newsom: Thanks, Joe.\nOperator: Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Curtis for any further closing comments.\nCurtis Griffith: Thanks, operator. Thank all of you for joining our call this morning. You've heard us discuss we are entering '24 in a real solid position. We think we have some good opportunities for growth in the bank and to highlight just a few of those one more time. We do have an improved treasury management team. We think that's going to drive both fee income and core deposit growth during the year. We are getting a gradual remixing of loan and securities portfolios into higher-yielding loans. And coupled with what we expect is low single-digit loan growth if the Texas economy remains healthy, we'll drive our net interest income growth. And as we've touched on multiple times, mortgage has certainly been challenging over the last several months, but we remain positioned to handle some improving volumes. And I think we're getting a build-up out there of needs for some financing that is going to start breaking loose as rates begin to come down, we're going to be well positioned for that. And most importantly, the credit quality of our loan portfolio does remain solid. So I'm excited for the year ahead. We thank you all for your time today and we hope to see you again soon. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor. For more information see our T&C."

All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Nicole Stokes, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nNicole Stokes: Thank you, Chuck and thank you to all who have joined our call today. During the call, we will be referencing the press release and the financial highlights that are available on the Investor Relations section of our website at amerisbank.com. I'm joined today by Palmer Proctor, our CEO; Jon Edwards, our Chief Credit Officer; and Doug Strange, our Managing Director of Credit who will be taking over for Jon when he retires at the end of this quarter. Palmer will begin today with some general opening comments and then I will begin to discussing the details of our financial results before we open up for Q&A. Before we begin, I'll remind you that our comments may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. The actual results could vary materially. We list some of the factors that might cause results to differ in our press release and in our SEC filings, which are available on our website. We do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, early developments or otherwise, except as required by law. Also during the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in reference to the company's performance. You can see our reconciliation of these measures and GAAP financial measures in the appendix to our presentation. And with that, I'll turn it over to Palmer for opening comments.\nPalmer Proctor: Thank you, Nicole and good morning everyone. I appreciate you taking the time to join our call today. I'm very pleased with the financial results, we reported yesterday, and I'm excited to be able to share some of the highlights in our overall strategic view for 2024 before Nicole gets into some of the financial details. 2023 was certainly a year of discipline and resilience for our company and the fourth quarter was a solid close to our plan. Throughout the year, we focused on strengthening the balance sheet to prepare ourselves for 2024 with a healthy margin, strong capital, and increased reserves. We grew deposits this year by over 6% and then controlled loan growth of 2%, improving our loan-to-deposit ratio to 98%, all while maintaining an above-peer net interest margin of 3.61% for the year. During the fourth quarter, we recorded $23 million provision for credit losses, bringing our year-to-date provision expense to over $142 million and that improves our coverage ratio up to 1.52% of loans and 365% of portfolio NPAs. And once again, this provisioning was model-driven and not related to any credit deterioration. We built and preserved capital this year such that our TCE ratio is well over our stated goal of 9% and we also grew tangible book value by over 12% this year. So, as we move into 2024, a lot of the confidence that we have is based on several factors. First, we have and will continue to fight to protect our margin and we're starting the year from a position of strength there, fortunately. We also have, as you know, a very granular deposit base, a very sticky deposit base. And then when you combine that with a well-capitalized balance sheet and a healthy allowance and obviously, as we've proven a culture of expense control, we also have a diversified revenue stream that generates above peer PPNR ROA. And last but not least, what gives us a lot of comfort too is just knowing that we have established individuals and a lot of the top growth markets throughout the Southeast. So, when it's appropriate to accelerate growth, we can do so. So, a lot of those are the main things that give us a lot of positive outlook as we look through the remainder of this year. But with that, I'll turn it over to Nicole now to discuss our financial results in more detail.\nNicole Stokes: Great. Thank you, Palmer. So, for the fourth quarter, we're reporting net income of $65.9 million or $0.96 per diluted share. On an adjusted basis, that's $73.6 million or $1.07 per diluted share. That brings our adjusted return on assets for the quarter to 1.15% and our adjusted return on tangible common equity of 12.81%. For the full year, we're reporting net income of $269.1 million or $3.89 per diluted share. On an adjusted basis, we earned $276.3 million or $4 per diluted share. That brings our full year adjusted ROA to 1.09% and our full year adjusted ROTC to 12.55%. Excluding the FDIC special assessment, our PPNR ROA was just over 2% coming in right at 2.01%. We continue to build capital throughout the year. We ended with tangible book value of $33.64, that's a $3.72 increase or 12.4% increase from the $29.92 at the beginning of the year and the fourth quarter increase was $1.26. Our tangible common equity ratio increased to 9.64% at the end of the quarter compared to 9.11% at the end of last quarter and 8.67% at the end of last year. On the revenue side of things, interest income increased $1.7 million to $332.2 million for the quarter. And for the year, interest income increased $387 million to $1.3 billion. Our net interest income increased $34 million or just over 4% for the year and that's been one of the most aggressive interest rate cycles we've seen in history. Our margin remains above peer and was stable this quarter at 3.54%, and we're encouraged by that. Beta catch-up was about eight basis points this quarter and was completely absorbed by our positive deposit mix and our asset yield. We were able to pay off about $1 billion of wholesale funding during the quarter, with that being about $700 million of FHLB advances and $324 million of brokered CDs. We continue to be very close to neutral on asset liability sensitivity, which positions us very well for the next Fed decision, whatever and whenever that is. We've updated our interest rate sensitivity information on Slide 11 in the presentation. Our non-interest income for the quarter decreased about $6.9 million, mostly in the mortgage division due to the normal fourth quarter seasonality. But the good news there from a profitability standpoint is their non-interest expense declined in step with that decline in income as they do a great job managing their variable costs. And as a company, we once again did a great job this quarter. Our adjusted expenses primarily excluding the $11.6 million FDIC assessment, decreased $2.1 million, almost all those variable expenses in the mortgage divisions as I just mentioned. That brought our adjusted efficiency ratio to 52.87% for the quarter and 52.58% for the year. We continue to look for expense reduction opportunities. And although there's always a cyclical first quarter bumps, we still believe we can maintain an efficiency ratio below 55% next year -- or this year 2024, even with the low single-digit non-interest expense increases this year. On the balance sheet side, we ended the year with total assets of $25.2 billion compared to $25.7 billion last quarter and $25.1 billion last year. Loans increased $68 million this quarter and $414 million for the year. Deposits grew $118 million during the quarter and $1.2 billion for the year. Non-interest-bearing deposits still represent 31% of our total deposits and represent just a minimal decline over last quarter. We do anticipate 2024 loan and deposit growth to increase to mid-single digits, in line with our prior guidance. So I want to close by reiterating how well positioned we are and how focused we are on a successful 2024. So, with that, I'm going to turn the call back over to Chuck for any questions from the group, and we certainly appreciate everyone's time today.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Brady Gailey with KBW. Please go ahead.\nBrady Gailey: Hey thanks. Good morning guys.\nNicole Stokes: Good morning Brady.\nBrady Gailey: I wanted to start with the net interest margin. It was great to see that flat on a linked quarter basis and I mean 3.5% is a great level. There's some of your peers that honestly are at 2.5%. But how do you think about -- you're neutral to rates, so how do you think about what the NIM could do as we look to 2024?\nNicole Stokes: Yes, that's a great question, Brady. And I'll tell you that really -- we were very pleased with that stable margin for the quarter, but margin guidance really hasn't changed. The stableness in the fourth quarter was really due to that deposit mix. We still expect that same single-digit compression that I had guided to last quarter. It's just that we were kind of able to punt that one quarter because of that mix, because of those public funds coming in and paying off those wholesale funding. So, we still say that we see some compression for one to two quarters. We were just able to punt it kind of buy ourselves one quarter of time. We still say that anything above 3.5% through this cycle would be a victory. We are very, very close to asset, liability sensitive neutral, as you can see on Slide 11. We do believe that deposit betas will be greater on the way down that if we do have the Fed cuts coming in potentially later in the year that we would be able to reduce rates faster on the way down, which would certainly help us. If that helps answer that question?\nBrady Gailey: Yes, that's helpful. And then when I look at your capital base, you have the goal of 9% tangible common equity. You're at 9.6% now and with your profitability pretty soon you'll be north of 10%. So, what do you do with that excess capital? I mean, you bought back a little bit of stock in 4Q. Do you increase the dividend? Do you look for other ways to grow the company? What do you do with that excess?\nPalmer Proctor: Well, Brady, you mentioned a lot of optionality there, which is exactly what that creates for us. But I think I would tell you during this point in time, just on where we are in this economic cycle, until we get a lot more clarity, I think the most prudent thing for us is to continue to preserve that capital. But to your point, as soon as we feel comfortable or we see some green shoots to be able to accelerate any growth, we will certainly use that accordingly.\nBrady Gailey: Okay. And then finally for me, Ameris screen is a little heavy in commercial real estate and specifically in office. Maybe just an update on how you guys are thinking about the office and CRE portfolio?\nJon Edwards: Yes, Brady, I don't know exactly where -- what you want to hear from that. But I mean, we haven't really been looking -- I think there were small -- three or four very small loans made during the quarter, but we're not really in the office sector really and haven't been for a while, but it's held up well. And we have less than 2% of office loans that are on our watch list and the performance of those in the -- better sectors, the essential use in the Class A has been pretty good. But we look at it a lot, right? I mean you've got to keep looking at it. You got to keep kind of dealing with turnover risk and things of that nature. So, we stay on top of it pretty well. And the rest of the portfolio, we've got the Slide 23 in there for you to get a good look at what the rest of the portfolio past dues and NPAs look like, and they're really not there. So, overall, our NPAs in the CRE book were six basis points. And I think that's still -- that is very, very good for this time.\nBrady Gailey: Okay, that's great to hear. And Jon, good luck in retirement. Great working with you over the years.\nJon Edwards: Thank you, Brady.\nOperator: The next question will come from Casey Whitman with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nCasey Whitman: Hey, good morning.\nNicole Stokes: Good morning Casey.\nCasey Whitman: Nicole, maybe just how are you thinking about expenses at the bank level here as we think about the growth rate that maybe we should expect in 2024. Can you just walk us through some of the puts and takes there?\nNicole Stokes: Sure. So, I think when we kind of look at our non-interest expense adjusted kind of take out the FDIC. And when I look at -- I'm looking at maybe about 3% to 5% -- and take out mortgage because of cyclicality of the mortgage and so much of that being variable. So, take out the mortgage segment. If you look at a 3% to 5% salary and benefits, 2%, everything else, you probably got a little bit more in IT and risk a little bit less in some of the other more general categories blend to that 2% and everything else. So, when you put that together, you end up with maybe a 3% blended rate. I think right now, consensus has about 4.5% growth. And I think that excess between that 3% and 4.5% is in the mortgage group. When you built in some growth in mortgage with some of the potential rates coming down, build in some mortgage. So, I think right now where that consensus is pretty close to where I think -- I mean, I think consensus has us about right, but that's kind of where I'm looking at it from an expense growth standpoint.\nCasey Whitman: Okay, got it. Thank you. Helpful. And I guess, Palmer just bigger-picture question, just with your comments around the loan growth outlook, I mean, which I appreciate mid-single-digits is still really good for you guys. But I guess, what would you -- what do you think would need to change or will need to happen before we kind of that need to turn up the growth engine, I assume that, that's going to be largely dependent just on the general economy, but what do we need to see there?\nPalmer Proctor: Well, a lot of our pullback obviously was on the CRE front, too. And capital has certainly helped us improve there in terms of our ratios. But I would tell you, as we start seeing things improve and obviously, the consumer data came out this morning, which looked right on target in terms of estimates. And if things start to improve there in terms of the outlook and the optimism and we feel it and see it in the markets. I will tell you the demand is still there. And that's -- the beauty of our footprint is that if and when we're ready, the opportunities are there. We're not going to have to be scrambling around to try and find those opportunities. They already exist. So, we have put a governor on this that's been self-induced, not by a lack of demand in the markets we're in, and we're fortunate to be able to say that. So, right now, I would tell you, is more of a time for in my opinion, for people in the industry to probably continue to be a little more selective which we'll continue to do, and we continue to take good care of our existing customers. And obviously, any new relationship -- I mean, any new opportunities they have, we will certainly entertain. But we remain very discerning and selective in the new business front. So, until we start seeing other improving metrics in CRE and in the economy overall, we'll kind of stay where we are.\nCasey Whitman: Makes sense. Thank you.\nPalmer Proctor: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from Christopher Marinac with Janney. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Marinac: Hey thanks. Good morning. Palmer, it's been two years since Balboa came on with the company. And I guess I just want to do a look back in terms of how you are adjusting the credit type that you're bringing in from that division? And then also the charge-off outlook either from Jon or Doug for what we should expect this year?\nPalmer Proctor: Yes, I'll touch on the strategy there and then Jon can chime in on the specifics on the charge-offs. I would tell you that line of business has been a great line of business for us. Obviously, it's a cyclical business in terms of the economy and these are small business operators. So, when the small business is under stress, we're certainly going to feel it. And more specifically, as we've talked about for us and many others that trucking industry has really been kind of the hot point. So, we have pulled back on that. And I think the important thing to understand there is that the credit box, obviously, there and the appetite for anything related to the trucking industry does not exist. So, we'll have to work that through the system. And now all of those loans are obviously not troubled loans, but some of them are, and they're feeling the stress from the economy like a lot of other small businesses are. But in terms of our -- being glad we have the business we are, I think it adds additional diversification. And as the market improves, I think that line of business will continue to deliver. The charge-offs are higher than we would like them, but we've done an excellent job of being able to reserve for any potential losses there, as you can see. And it still remains a small part of our balance sheet. And as we've said from the inception, it's got a cap in terms of what percentage it would become of the balance sheet, which is 10%. I would tell you right now, it's kept pretty much right where it is until we start seeing some improvement in the overall economy. So, that's kind of the overall. And Jon, you can kind of talk to the specifics in terms of the net charge-offs, if you like.\nJon Edwards: Chris, Palmer did a great job of overviewing that and I agree,100% with everything. The charge-offs just as a context. Remember, the charge-offs in 2022 were only $8 million. And so clearly, what he said about trucking, and we took a little market share in 2022 and that's what we really dealt with in 2023. But we did tighten the box as we saw what was necessary. We tightened it a little more and we're just continuing to tweak as we need to make sure that we're getting the credit in there that we really want. And to his point, it's -- we're seeing good trendlines in terms of past dues and things of that nature that would make us believe that -- I don't know if you want to call it egg through the snake is coming to the end, and I don't anticipate that this year we'll have the same level of charge-offs as last, certainly.\nChristopher Marinac: Great. Thank you, both. That's very helpful. And then just a quick one for Nicole. Are you seeing any deposit rate exceptions? Or have those slowed down in the last quarter or so?\nNicole Stokes: We have definitely seen some deposit rate exception slowing, and we have also seen competitive pressure starts to slow, specifically where we had seen some very heavy pressure in Florida from credit unions, we have started to see that slow, which is good.\nChristopher Marinac: Great. Thank you for taking my questions.\nOperator: The next question will come from David Feaster with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nDavid Feaster: Hey, good morning everybody.\nNicole Stokes: Good morning David.\nDavid Feaster: I'd like to follow-up kind of on that deposit question side. I mean given the prospects of rate cuts, I'm curious how you think about your ability to reprice deposits if we do get Fed cuts this year? Or just given liquidity challenges in the industry competitive landscape and all that, would you expect this maybe to be a bit more challenging on the way down and betas are slower than they were -- than on the way up? I'm just curious how you think about your ability to reprice deposits lower if we do get cuts this year?\nNicole Stokes: Yes. So, we think that deposit betas are going to be faster on the way down. And then from a tactical perspective, we've got 95% of our retail CDs that mature in 2024. And then all of our brokered CDs are short and they mature by June. And then we've got very short FHLB and very minimal FHLB advances. So, we definitely have some positive movement on the deposit side, where we feel like we'll be able to reprice those. And then you add in just the interest-bearing money market that they will reprice fairly quickly. So, we feel like we could be aggressive, and then the 31% non-interest-bearing will certainly help that as well.\nDavid Feaster: Okay, that's helpful. And maybe touching on again staying on with potential cuts. I'm curious, high level, how do you think about mortgage at this point and some of the trends you're seeing? And maybe how much activity, would you -- I mean, again, mortgage rates have started to come down a bit, could come down even more with rate cuts. I'm curious how you think about, A, mortgage volumes in the coming year? And any expectations for that gain on sale margin to start improving?\nPalmer Proctor: Yes, I think with the Fed cuts or potential Fed cuts, obviously, we'll see improvement in that margin. But I would tell you, as we mentioned last time, so many times in environments like this, we all have a tendency to look at headwinds and not focus on tailwinds. But this would certainly be a big tailwind for our operation just because of how well we're positioned. And what we've done and what we've been able to do in terms of garnering efficiencies and keeping the costs in line with the revenue decline, that seem is true on the flip side. So, when the when the opportunity is there and the refis and the purchase activity picks back up, we are extremely well-positioned there. So, I would tell you that as we look out and if we end up getting as many rate cuts as everyone thinks we are, that could be a tremendous lift for our organization, just knowing how we performed in the past and how we can perform in the future. And more importantly, how we're already positioned in terms of our bankers and also our operations. So, that could be a real bright spot. But a lot of that, as we touched on, is going to be predicated by the -- what the Fed does. Because that's the big driver, as you know of that consumer behavior.\nDavid Feaster: Yes, that makes a lot of sense. And maybe just last one from me. I'm curious how you think about -- you guys have done a great job on the deposit -- managing deposits. And we talked about where we can cut -- how quickly we can cut betas or betas are going to be on the way down. I'm curious how you think about deposit growth going forward? And maybe just -- it seems like we've seen some more seasonality from some folks on the deposit front. Curious how you think about your ability to drive core deposit growth in this coming year and some initiatives that you put in place to maybe support that?\nPalmer Proctor: Yes, I would tell you that's probably something that we're very bullish on in the sense that if you look at the momentum that we created even during the liquidity this year, which was a very difficult year. If you can grow deposits in an environment like we've been in over the last 12 months and more importantly, retained deposits and maintain your deposit mix, which we've done a very good job of doing, net of the pandemic deposits. But I think part of the value there is, a lot of that came from a lot of our organic growth and long relationships, and we've always been focused more on relationships and transactions and that has served us well, and that's what we continue to do. And if you look at investments that we've made this year, a lot of those -- we kept saying throughout the entire year from an expense standpoint that we did not have to load up on any more bankers out there to bring in volume and thank goodness we didn't because the volume was intentionally pulled back. But what we did invest in as treasury. So, our treasury platform has had a tremendous year, and a lot of that comes from our C&I initiatives and also from the hard work of a lot of the treasury offers we have. So, that momentum is really what helped move a lot of the needle in fourth quarter and I think that same momentum will be there throughout the year. So, we've got a lot of initiatives in place there that are delivering now and we'll continue to deliver. So, I probably feel a little more optimistic than most in terms of our ability to keep growing core funding.\nDavid Feaster: I mean, so would you expect core funding to maybe outpace loan growth? Or would you expect maybe that remixing of the balance sheet to kind of keep deposits stable and just, again, improve the mix? Curious kind of how you think about growth prospects and overall balance sheet growth?\nPalmer Proctor: Yes, in the perfect world, obviously, would be all loans will be funded with core funding, but we know that's not a reality. So, -- and then there's obviously a balance there in terms of our desire for loan growth. Right now, I'd tell you that loan growth desire is muted as we talked about earlier. So, I think you're going to probably see a -- from a percentage standpoint, you'll probably see more core funding relative to loan growth. But once we start accelerating loan growth or feel it's appropriate to do so, then you would probably see more of a utilizing wholesale funding or other types of funding beyond just core funding.\nDavid Feaster: Okay, terrific. Thanks everybody.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Palmer Proctor for any closing remarks. Please go ahead sir.\nPalmer Proctor: Yes. I'd just like to thank everyone once again for listening to our fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings results. And I'd also like to give a special thank you and recognition to Jon Edwards, our Chief Credit Officer. This will be his last earnings call. But I'd like to thank him for his friendship and service to Ameris for over 25 years. We are certainly going to miss him, but he assures me that he's just a phone call away if we ever need him. But I want to thank everybody once again for their time and their interest in Ameris Bank. Have a great day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor. For more information see our T&C."

Additionally, the company has actively engaged in share repurchases, buying back 146,580 shares of common stock during the quarter.\nIn the earnings call, CEO Lee Gibson expressed confidence in the company's strategy and its ability to manage deposit cost pressures.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to VP of Investor Relations, Lindsey Bailes. Please go ahead.\nLindsey Bailes: Thank you, Latif. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Southside Bancshares fourth quarter and year-end 2023 earnings call. A transcript of today's call will be posted on southside.com under Investor Relations. During today's call and in other disclosures and presentations, I will remind you that any forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described in our earnings release and our Form 10-K. Joining me today are Lee Gibson, President and CEO, and Julie Shamburger, CFO. First, Lee will share his comments on the quarter and then Julie will give an overview of our financial results. I will now turn the call over to Lee.\nLee Gibson: Thank you, Lindsey. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Southside Bancshares fourth quarter and year-end earnings call. This morning we reported fourth quarter net income of $17.3 million, earnings per share of $0.57, a return on average tangible common equity of 13.1% and continued strong asset quality metrics. During the fourth quarter, net income was impacted by a loss of $10.4 million or $0.27 per share due to a restructuring of a portion of the securities portfolio by selling approximately $388 million of lower-yielding AFS securities. The proceeds were largely reinvested in premium US Agency mortgage-backed securities with approximately 20% reinvested in loans. The restructuring is estimated to increase net interest income, resulting in a two-year payback of the loss. Linked quarter, our net interest income increased $1.2 million and the net interest margin declined only 3 basis points, less than originally estimated. Given the restructuring of the securities portfolio, we believe the net interest margin is at or near the bottom and should begin to slowly move higher during 2024. Linked quarter, we continue to experience excellent loan growth with loans increasing $103.9 million or 2.3%. We ended the year with 9.1% loan growth, slightly exceeding our estimate. For 2024, we are currently budgeting for 5% loan growth. The markets we serve remain healthy and continue to grow and perform well. I look forward to answering your questions following Julie's remarks. I will now turn the call over to Julie.\nJulie Shamburger: Thank you, Lee. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter and year-end call. We ended the year with net income of $86.7 million and diluted earnings per share of $2.82. For the fourth quarter, we reported net income of $17.3 million, a decrease of $1.1 million on a linked quarter basis, and diluted earnings per common share of $0.57, a decrease of $0.03 compared to September 30. For 2023, we had loan growth of $376.8 million or 9.1%. The growth was driven primarily by increases of $230.1 million in construction loans and $180.7 million in commercial real estate loans. For the fourth quarter, we had loan growth of $103.9 million or 2.3% linked quarter, driven by increases in construction loans of $69.2 million and commercial real estate loans of $51.1 million. The interest rate of loans funded during the quarter was on average approximately 8%. As of December 31, our loans with oil and gas industry exposure were $94.5 million or 2.1% of total loans. Our allowance for credit losses increased by $1 million for the linked quarter to $46.6 million. The increase was driven by our loan loss provision of $2.2 million and a provision for off-balance sheet credit exposures of $79,000 for the fourth quarter. The provision on loan loss was primarily driven by the increase in loans during the fourth quarter. Asset quality metrics remained strong with non-performing assets of $4 million or 0.05% of total assets on December 31. On December 31, our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 0.94%, consistent on a linked quarter basis. Our securities portfolio decreased $40.1 million or 1.5% on a linked quarter basis, driven by sales of AFS securities in late December due to strategic opportunities related to a drop in treasury rates and reinvestment of proceeds, primarily into higher-yielding securities and to a lesser extent into loans. The sales resulted in a net realized loss of $10.4 million. There were no transfers of AFS securities during the fourth quarter or for the year ended December 31. As of December 31, we had a net unrealized loss in the AFS securities portfolio of $36.2 million compared to $137 million last quarter, a decrease of $100.8 million, primarily in the municipal securities portfolio due to lower interest rates and to a lesser extent, the sale of securities. As of December 31, the unrealized gain on the fair value hedges on municipal securities was approximately $13.6 million compared to $42.2 million linked quarter, also driven by the lower interest rates. This unrealized gain partially offset the unrealized losses in the AFS securities portfolio. Our AOCI on December 31, 2023, was a net loss of $113.5 million compared to a net loss of $155 million on September 30, 2023. The net loss was comprised of net losses on our securities and swap derivatives of $94.7 million and $18.8 million related to our retirement plans. As of December 31, the duration in the total securities portfolio was 8.4 years and the duration of the AFS portfolio was 5.8 years, a decrease from 9.7 years and eight years respectively at September 30. At quarter end, our mix of loans and securities increased slightly to 64% and 36% respectively, compared to 63% and 37% on September 30. Deposits increased $200.1 million or 3.2% on a linked quarter basis, driven primarily by an increase in public fund deposits of $145.4 million and broker deposits of $38.4 million. Our capital ratios remained strong with all capital ratios well above the capital adequacy and well-capitalized threshold. Liquidity resources remained solid with $2.2 billion in liquidity lines available as of December 31. During the fourth quarter, we purchased 146,580 shares of common stock at an average price of $28.54, pursuant to our stock repurchase plan. We have not repurchased any shares since the end of the year. Our tax equivalent net interest margin decreased 3 basis points on a linked quarter basis to 2.99% from 3.02%. The tax equivalent net interest spread decreased for the same period by 5 basis points to 2.26%, down from 2.31%. For the three months ended December 31, net interest income increased $1.2 million or 2.3% compared to the linked quarter. The purchased loan accretion recorded this quarter was $63,000. Non-interest income, excluding the net loss on the sales of AFS securities, increased $2.1 million or 19% for the linked quarter, primarily due to the increase in BOLI income of $1.8 million in the fourth quarter. Non-interest expense decreased $370,000 on a linked quarter basis to $35.2 million. For 2024, we have budgeted approximately $37.9 million in non-interest expense for each quarter. Our fully taxable equivalent efficiency ratio decreased to 50.86% as of December 31 from 52.29% as of September 30. Income tax expense decreased $914,000 from $3.1 million during the third quarter, and our effective tax rate decreased to 11.3% for the fourth quarter, down from 14.5% in the previous quarter. We currently estimate an annual effective tax rate of 18% for 2024. Thank you for joining us today. This concludes our comments and we will open the lines for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you for standing by. Our first question comes from the line of Graham Dick of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead, Graham.\nGraham Dick: Hey. Good morning, guys.\nJulie Shamburger: Good morning.\nGraham Dick: I just wanted to start on loan growth. Another solid quarter for you guys relative to what we've seen from some peers. How are you thinking about growth into 2024 as it relates to what your markets are offering right now versus maybe the potential for also new hires? Just generally, if you could give an idea for the trajectory you're expecting, you think it'd be less or more or about in line with what we've seen over the last, maybe the back half of 2023? Thanks.\nLee Gibson: Right now, Graham, we're projecting 5% loan growth throughout 2024. Some of that's going to be dependent on interest rates. If interest rates do decrease quite a bit, then some of these loans we may be able to make. But right now, with the interest rates where they are, even with the healthy markets we have, we feel like 5% is a good place for us to budget right now. Obviously, if we see things change during the year, we'll update that estimate.\nGraham Dick: Got it. And then I guess, Lee, on the securities transaction this quarter, can you just run through some of your thoughts on it? How you view -- I guess how you viewed it as appealing or attractive when you initially did it?\nLee Gibson: Yeah. When the rates came down during the fourth quarter, we took a look at some of our interest rate swaps on our municipals, and basically, we were able to come out of about $200 million of long-term, lower-rate municipals at pretty much a push. And then we sold, as mortgage-backed securities increased in value, we sold another $188 million of mortgage-backed securities. And that's really where the loss ended up being, because we ended up with about a $6.4 million gain on our swaps that we unwound, and that gave us the net $10,400,000 loss on the security sales. So basically, we were able to come out of things even with the rate that we were making on the swaps and increase the overall yield on the $388 million, about 175 basis points.\nGraham Dick: Yeah, it seems like a good trade. Is there anything else like this that you're looking right now, or do you think that you kind of have to wait to get some more clarity on where rates are going, or do you have a certain call on where rates might be going, I guess?\nLee Gibson: I think at this point, in terms of any additional movement in the securities portfolio, we really aren't looking at anything. Should interest rates change further, long-term rates move down further from here, we certainly would take a look at that, but right now we don't. In terms of forecast on interest rates, I guess it's pretty much anybody's guess. The biggest guess is on when and if the Fed's going to begin to lower rates. Our thought is that it's probably closer to summer than it is March if they make that first move. Long-term rates, they've already come down in anticipation of some of that decline.\nGraham Dick: Yeah. Okay. Good to hear. And then I guess just lastly on the margin, I just -- this may be a more point of clarification, but it's only down 3 basis points this quarter, a lot better than I think I was expecting and the rest of the analysts in the street. I just wanted to hear if there was something there that surprised you, I guess, to allow for basically a flattish margin or if there's more pressure to come. I remember you referenced it, I think 2.75% number last quarter.\nLee Gibson: Yeah. I think the question last quarter was, could it get down to 2.75%? And I didn't mean in one quarter. At that time, we weren't sure what kind of loan growth we were going to have. And we were continuing to see the deposit pressure with the deposit pressure remained during the quarter, but the loan growth ended up being probably a little stronger than we anticipated. And then with the restructuring primarily occurring in December, that gave us a little lift in the back half of December. So it did surprise me that we only dropped 3 basis points, but with the restructuring and the loan growth that we had, that's why I feel like we're either at or near the bottom at this point, and we should be able to see the NIM move up during 2024.\nGraham Dick: Okay. And I assume that increase in the NIM in 2024 does include some rate cuts. Maybe not as many as the market is predicting right now, but some starting at some point this year, right?\nLee Gibson: Yeah. Right now we're budgeting for 3%. It's anybody's guess. And the first one we're budgeting for is in June, last one in December. So really only two rate cuts would help the NIM. The one in December, I don't -- it certainly won't hurt, but it's not going to lift it dramatically.\nGraham Dick: Okay. All right. I appreciate it guys. Thank you very much.\nLee Gibson: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Mark Shutley of KBW. Your question please, Mark.\nMark Shutley: Hey, good morning.\nLee Gibson: Good morning.\nJulie Shamburger: Good morning.\nMark Shutley: So, I guess, on fences, just to clarify that I heard you correctly. So looking at like $37 million quarterly run rate in '24 and with sort of a lot of the technology implementation stuff sort of baked into 2023, I'm wondering what's really going to drive that growth in '24? Thanks.\nJulie Shamburger: Yes, Mark. The biggest things driving that is our salaries and employee benefits. And then there is additional, a little bit over $3 million for additional software technologies that is built into that number as well. And then we have budgeted for 2024 about $1 million. We're going to be combining two locations in one of our smaller markets and probably be disposing off one of the buildings. And so we budgeted for some loss there. So those are the three largest items. But still, I guess one of the bigger, the software and technology, we still can -- we're looking at more spend there.\nMark Shutley: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And then with the securities restructuring and sort of the shifting of the balance sheet, I was just wondering more what's your goal for that mix of assets, maybe by year-end and possibly longer-term currently sitting at, I think you said like a 64%, 36%. This is -- yeah, kind of wondering how you anticipate the balance sheet playing out from here. Thanks.\nLee Gibson: As -- with the shift in the restructuring of the securities portfolio right now, we have -- the securities that we purchased are all, well, they're at least -- all of them total are at least at par. And I think they're probably all at gains net. So that gives us a lot of flexibility without impacting the P&L to sell those securities if we want to put them into loans and if the loan growth is greater than what we're anticipating. And a lot of that depends on what deposit growth is. If deposit growth can keep up with loan growth, then we likely will keep those securities. If not, we'll be able to sell some of those securities with little or no loss and put that into higher-margin loans. So ideally, with the loan growth we're going to see -- we expect to see in 2024, we'll move that mix to less securities and more loans. How much that moves? I don't really know, but it would probably be a few basis points up in loans and down in securities.\nMark Shutley: Got it. Thank you. And maybe just one more. Do you still see yourself sort of not slowing down on the buybacks until the current authorization is used up? And I guess sort of, what's your outlook for that as far as your capital [card] (ph) 2024?\nLee Gibson: I think what we're going to look for there is, if there are opportunistic times to buy, we'll be in the market buying. If the stock is at certain levels, we'll probably pull back from that. I think our average buy price in the fourth quarter was somewhere in the $28 range.\nJulie Shamburger: Most of that happened early. Well, in October -- it went through late October.\nLee Gibson: So we'll be looking for -- hopefully, there aren't any opportunistic times to buy stock, but if there are, we have that buyback available for us.\nMark Shutley: Got it. That makes sense. Thanks for taking my questions.\nLee Gibson: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Olney of Stephens Inc. Please go ahead, Matt.\nMatt Olney: Thank you. Just a few follow-ups here from some previous questions. On the loan growth front, it looks like the construction loans continue to build a pretty healthy clip. Any more color here? Has construction peaked or you still see some more growth in '24 in that book?\nLee Gibson: I think we'll see some more growth in that. And they're primarily loans that we originated in late '21, during '22, and then in early '23. We're not seeing as many new construction loans at this point in time. But these are just advances where that 40% to 50% equity has gone in, and now they're looking for draws. And that's what's really creating that at this point.\nMatt Olney: And remind me on this construction book, any concentrations by market. And does it lean more residential or commercial?\nLee Gibson: It's primarily multifamily, home building and warehouse would be the three largest concentrations. And I don't really think there's a huge concentration by market. They're pretty well split between DFW, Austin, and maybe to a little lesser extent, the Houston market.\nMatt Olney: Okay. Appreciate those details. And then any color on the recent loan growth as far as what some of those yields are? So the new loan yields?\nLee Gibson: The -- go ahead, Julie.\nJulie Shamburger: The average for the quarter was 8%, I mean, on all loans.\nMatt Olney: And that's a, I assume, some kind of new and renewed yield. Is that right?\nLee Gibson: That is correct.\nMatt Olney: I'm sorry, I missed that.\nLee Gibson: Yeah, that is correct.\nMatt Olney: Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then going back to the securities restructure, you gave us lots of good details there a few minutes ago as far as what was sold. I think I missed maybe some details about what was purchased in that restructure. Do you have anything from that point of view?\nLee Gibson: Sure. About 80% of the proceeds from the sale went into premium US Agency mortgage-backed securities, Fannie and Freddie, and about 20% of those proceeds went into loans. We just wanted to go ahead and get, with the rates doing what they're doing and potential anticipation of the Fed doing something, we wanted to go ahead and get that money working. But right now the mortgage-backed securities overall are ahead again, and if we need to move out of those and into loans, higher-yielding loans, then we feel like we're in a good position to do that without impacting the P&L on the sale of those securities at this point.\nMatt Olney: Okay. And what were the yields on some of the securities that you purchased?\nLee Gibson: They were Fannie and Freddie, and the average yield was a little over 6%.\nMatt Olney: Okay. That's all helpful. And then earlier in your comments around the margin, you mentioned that you're feeling better about the deposit cost pressure. Just wanted to kind of focus on that comment. Any more color you can provide as far as what you're seeing more recently and kind of how much conviction you have that deposit costs are flying out and will peak here shortly?\nLee Gibson: I don't expect -- well, until the Fed starts cutting, I don't expect them to flatten out. I expect them to continue to increase, but I don't think they're going to increase at the pace they've been increasing. And then with loan growth and with the restructuring of securities portfolio, we feel like that the benefit associated with that is going to help offset any further deposit pressure at this point in time. But we do expect deposit pressure to continue. But most of the heavy lifting is behind us. But there's still going to be some going forward. Even after the first rate cut, 25 basis points isn't likely to take pressure off of some of the non-maturity interest-bearing deposits.\nMatt Olney: Okay. Perfect. All right. Thanks for all the color.\nLee Gibson: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Lee Gibson for closing remarks. Sir?\nLee Gibson: All right. Thank you everyone for joining us today. We appreciate the opportunity to answer your questions along with your interest in Southside Bancshares. In closing, we're looking forward to our prospects during 2024 and to reporting first quarter results to you during our next earnings call in April. Thank you, again.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. I would now like to welcome, Adriano Duarte, Investor Relations Officer to begin the call. Adriano, over to you.\nAdriano Duarte: Thank you, Mandeep. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call. Today's presenters are President and CEO, Tony Labozzetta; and Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Tom Lyons. Before beginning the review of our financial results, we ask that you please take note of our standard caution, as to any forward-looking statements that may be made during the course of today's call. Our disclaimer is contained in last evening's earnings release, which has been posted to the Investor Relations page on our website, provident.bank. Now it's my pleasure to introduce Tony Labozzetta who will offer his perspective on the quarter. Thanks. Tony?\nAnthony Labozzetta: Thank you, Adriano. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Provident Financial Services earnings call. The fourth quarter was characterized by moderate economic growth, fluctuating interest rates and continued industry-wide funding challenges, resulting in reduced profits for many regional banks. Provident has navigated these complexities with resilience, bolstered by a commitment to our robust risk management and customer centric approach. Provident produced good core financial results this quarter, which once again demonstrates the stability of our franchise and the strength of our management team. As such, we reported earnings of $0.36 per share, an annualized return on average assets of 0.77%, and a return on average tangible equity of 9.47%. Excluding merger related charges and contingent litigation reserves, our pre-tax pre-provision return on average assets was 1.25% for the fourth quarter. At quarter end, our capital was strong and exceeded well capitalized. Tangible book value per share increased 5.9% to $16.32. Our tangible common equity ratio was 8.96%. As such, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per share, payable on February 23. During the quarter, our average core deposits remain very stable. Our rising rate cycle-to-date deposit beta was approximately 33.5%, which is well below average based on available data and we believe is among the best in our peer group. Our deposit beta and steady deposit levels reflect the quality of our deposit base. Our total cost of deposits increased as expected, given market trends, but remained among the best in our peer group. The total cost of funds grew 19 basis points to 2.23%, compressing our net interest margin 4 basis points to 2.92%. We expect a continued easing in the rate of increase in our total cost of funds, which should stabilize the net interest margin. Our commercial lending team closed approximately $450 million of new commercial loans during the fourth quarter. Payoffs remained relatively low at about $95 million, which is consistent with the trailing quarter. Our credit metrics continue to be strong in the fourth quarter, and we are maintaining prudent underwriting standards, particularly in our CRE lending portfolio. As a result of our production and low level of prepayments, our commercial loans grew approximately $212 million or 9.2% annualized for the quarter. For the year, we grew $641 million or 7.3%. The pull-through in our commercial loan pipeline during the fourth quarter was in line with our expectations, and the gross pipeline remained strong at approximately $1.1 billion. The pull-through adjusted pipeline, including loans pending closing is approximately $671 million, and our projected pipeline rate is 7.17%. And we remain optimistic regarding the strength and quality of our pipeline. Our fee based business has performed well. Despite a hardened insurance market, Provident Protection Plus has strong fourth quarter with 81% organic growth, which resulted in a 19.7% increase in revenue, and a 4.1% increase in operating profit as compared to the same quarter last year. Fee income at Beacon Trust remained stable. Improved market conditions drove an increase in assets under management to $3.9 billion at year end, which should drive improved fee income in the first quarter of 2024. With regard to our prospective merger with Lakeland Bancorp, we are continuing our engagement with the regulators and await final approval of the merger. While regulatory approval is not within our control and is not guaranteed, preparations for our merger with Lakeland continues to progress, as both companies eagerly await approval. As we move into 2024, our focus will be on growing our business lines with an emphasis on deposit growth. In addition, we will continue to strengthen the fundamentals of our business with a particular attention towards operational efficiency, pricing discipline and risk management. Now I will turn the call over to Tom for his comments on our financial performance. Tom?\nTom Lyons: Thank you, Tony, and good morning, everyone. As Tony noted, our net income for the quarter was $27.3 million or $0.36 per share compared with $28.5 million or $0.38 per share for the trailing quarter, and $49 million or $0.66 per share for the fourth quarter of 2022. Transaction charges related to our pending merger with Lakeland Bancorp totaled $2.5 million in the current quarter or approximately $0.03 per share, and $2.3 million in the trailing quarter. Excluding these merger-related charges and a $3 million charge for contingent litigation reserves, pre-tax pre-provision earnings for the quarter were $44.4 million or an annualized 1.25% of average assets. Revenue totaled $115 million for the quarter compared with $116 million for the trailing quarter, from $132 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. Our net interest margin decreased 4 basis points from the trailing quarter to 2.92%. The yield on earning assets improved by 15 basis points versus the trailing quarter, as floating and adjustable rate loans repriced favorably and new loan originations reflected higher market rates. This improvement in asset yields, however, was more than offset by an increase in interest-bearing funding costs. Increased interest expense reflected current market conditions and funding requirements, which resulted in an increase in average borrowings, despite an increase in average deposits. Average non-interest-bearing balances also decreased as some balances moved to our interest-bearing insured cash suite product in the trailing quarter, in order to obtain increased deposit insurance. The shift from non-interest-bearing to the ICS product has greatly diminished in the fourth quarter. In addition, whilst average balances and rates paid on interest-bearing demand and time deposits increased during the quarter. The average total cost of deposits increased 21 basis points in the trailing quarter to 1.95%, this is a deceleration from the trailing quarter, but the increase towards our rising rate cycle to date, total deposit cost beta to 33.5%. The average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities also increased 21 basis points in the trailing quarter to 2.71%. The prolonged inverted yield curve and ongoing deposit competition continued to impact funding costs. This is expected to largely offset future improvements in asset yields, and we currently project the margin will stabilize in the 2.85% to 2.90% range. Period end total loans grew $206 million, driven by C&I, CRE and multi-family mortgage loans. Our pull-through adjusted loan pipeline at year end was $671 million with a weighted average rate of 7.17% versus our current portfolio yield of 5.5%. Asset quality remains strong, with non-performing loans totaling 46 basis points of total loans, and criticized and classified loans representing 2.2% of total loans. Net charge-offs were $863,000 or an annualized 3 basis points of average loans this quarter, bringing our full year net charge-offs to just 8 basis points. The provision for credit losses on loans decreased to $500,000 for the quarter due to a modestly improved economic forecast within our CECL model. As a result, the allowance for credit losses on loans decreased to 99 basis points of total loans at December 31 from 1.01% at September 30. Non-interest income remained steady this quarter at $19 million. Excluding provisions for credit losses on commitments to extend credit, merger-related charges and the establishment of a $3 million contingent litigation reserve related to a previously disclosed matter, non-interest expense increased to $70.4 million for the quarter and included two additional notable items that are not expected to recur. These items consisted of a $2 million write-down of an REO property and a $775,000 special FDIC assessment. Our effective tax rate was also impacted by an unusual discrete item this quarter as a deferred tax asset related to performance-based stock compensation was written down by $1.9 million. We currently project our 2024 effective tax rate to return to approximately 26.5%. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'd be happy to respond to questions.\nOperator: The floor is now open for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark Fitzgibbon with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nMark Fitzgibbon: Hey, guys. Good morning. Happy Friday.\nAnthony Labozzetta: Mark, how are you?\nMark Fitzgibbon: Good. Thanks. Hey, Tony. I wonder if you guys could explain that contingent litigation reserve, what it relates to and how that flows?\nAnthony Labozzetta: Yeah, Mark. That's pending litigation that we disclosed in our last quarter 10-Q, in the contingency footnote. There's greater detail available there, but it's an estimate of a potential settlement or ultimate damage outcome.\nMark Fitzgibbon: And I just don't have that in front of me. What does it relate to, Tom?\nTom Lyons: Yeah. It's a class action -- part of a class action lawsuit around approved positive settle negative overdraft fees, with respect to debit card transactions.\nMark Fitzgibbon: Got you. Okay. And then secondly, it looked like there was about a $19.6 million uptick in non-performing commercial loans. Any color you could provide on those?\nTom Lyons: Yeah. The flows for the quarter were actually positive, absent one large loan moving into non-performing category. We had about $10 million of favorable resolutions and then we had a $19 million -- a little over $19 million loan move into the non-performing category. We have -- at this point, we deem adequate collateral coverage, and we're working through a resolution on that borrowers cooperative winding down operations and looking to market the underlying collateral properties.\nAnthony Labozzetta: It's a C&I loan.\nTom Lyons: It's a C&I loan, yes.\nMark Fitzgibbon: Okay. And then, Tom, any thoughts on sort of expense growth this year, excluding the impact of Lakeland?\nTom Lyons: Yeah. I think we'd be about $68 million to $69 million a quarter. It usually weighed a little heavier in the first quarter, first quarter and a half of the year Mark, just because of the usual seasonal items in payroll tax resets.\nMark Fitzgibbon: Okay. And then lastly, could you share with us AUM and maybe net flows for the quarter?\nTom Lyons: AUM closed at $3.9 billion, really we saw the big pickup in the last month of the year, looking at averages, at September 30, it was $3.6 billion, $3.551 billion, went down to $3.4 billion, $3.7 billion and $3.9 billion at the end of the period. So in terms of flows, a pretty good pickup in terms of organic growth over the course of the year. Nothing notable to bring your attention in terms of outflows.\nMark Fitzgibbon: So in the fourth quarter, there were positive flows, positive net flows?\nAnthony Labozzetta: That's correct.\nMark Fitzgibbon: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Billy Young with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nBill Young: Hey. Good morning, guys. How are you?\nAnthony Labozzetta: Good morning, Bill.\nBill Young: I guess just to touch on the margin guidance, the $285 million to $295 million range for the year. I guess, can you just help us parse through what gets you to kind of the top end of the range? And then what you're assuming are rate cuts. I think last quarter, you're assuming two out of four cuts, pointing closer to six. So how did that kind of change your margin expectations? Thanks.\nTom Lyons: Yeah. The softest part of the estimate, Bill, is probably on the funding side as we try to anticipate, absent any rate movement or even in the face of a declining rate environment, how much further the liability cost could go up, particularly on the deposit side because we are pretty low relative to our peer group. So we don't see that necessarily stopping just because rate movements have plateaued. In terms of what's model, we work off the Moody's (NYSE:MCO) baseline forecast as a kind of a default and adjust it if we deem it necessary. So that's what's built into our model right now. They had 425 basis point rate increases in there, but the last one is in December. So figure three that would be meaningful to 2024.\nAnthony Labozzetta: Yeah. I would just add on to that, that some of the trends that we're seeing in terms of -- on the deposit side and the cost rising are very much stabilized. But I think what Tom is mentioning is that given where we are in terms of cost of deposits, the dynamics may occur that could show us on the lower end of that margin. But if they don't, we should be on the higher end of our expectation.\nTom Lyons: That's correct. And Bill, I misspoke. I said rate increases, obviously, I meant rate decreases.\nBill Young: Right. Okay. And then I guess as a follow-up to that, obviously, your deposit betas screened very well versus peers in the industry. Like you said, and I guess there was -- and maybe we have a slight lag on the way up, kind of thinking, I guess, beyond 2024 a little bit, how do you think deposit betas should behave on the way down?\nTom Lyons: Again, if the terminal rate is lower than the competitive environment, it would probably slowdown in terms of -- meaning that we wouldn't be able to decrease quite as quickly on the way down as you would, if we were up to full market pricing. Hopefully, we're conservative in that. That's how we're modeling it.\nBill Young: Okay. Got it. And then switching gears, C&I growth was nice and pretty strong this quarter. Can you just speak to kind of what were some of the drivers there that you saw? And how are you feeling about the opportunities going to 2024 here?\nAnthony Labozzetta: Well, the drivers were tactical. That was our focus internally, how we drove not only parts of our incentive plan, but our focus, even reducing the levels of -- in the CRE side, in terms of how much we would own on an individual loan and some of the qualitative nature. More importantly, one of the drivers was how we attach the total relationship to it, meaning the deposit side. So naturally, you would see a lot of transactional CRE not happening at Provident over the last couple of quarters, and you'll see more of a focus on the deposit relational side, which comes largely on the C&I. But even on the CRE side, the stuff that we've been putting on has been coming on with deposit relationships. So again, I think that's a focus internally and our team rose to the challenge. And we see that happening again, market conditions are considered. We see that focus moving into 2024 even more acutely.\nTom Lyons: The other factor that helped loan growth in Q4, Bill, was a reduction in prepayments. I think we're going to see a little bit of pickup. I know for the first couple of weeks of this quarter, some of the things that we expected to pay off in Q4 didn't pay off until Q1. So I think looking forward in terms of the loan growth rate, something in the 4% to 5% range makes sense for us for 2024.\nBill Young: Great. Appreciate it, guys. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve got.\nTom Lyons: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Perito with KBW. Please go ahead.\nMichael Perito: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.\nTom Lyons: Good morning, Mike.\nMichael Perito: Just one quick follow-up on the last line of questioning, just around loan growth. 4% to 5% for the year seems very reasonable. But any areas of upside to that? I mean, like, for example, maybe on the construction side, where there still seems to be a lot of supply issues, particularly on the residential construction side in your markets. Just any areas where you think there maybe could be a pickup if we kind of continue to kind of glide to the soft landing on the macro side?\nAnthony Labozzetta: Yeah. I will answer that in a little bit of unusual way because I think there's an upside in all of our lending categories that we choose to be in. I think this year, we were very contained in our lending. We tightened down a lot of our underwriting standards in anticipation of what might happen in the marketplace. We deemphasized certain concentrations we had, and we spent a good amount of time altering some of those, including the construction portfolio. So from our perspective, had it been business as usual, we could have had a substantial growth in 2023. Our folks are out there. I think if market conditions are prevalent that allow for loan growth, I think we'll get our fair share, and we can certainly meet or exceed the expectations that Tom just mentioned. But all within the credit underwriting standards that we have in place.\nMichael Perito: Got it. Helpful, Tony. Thanks. And a little bit of a conceptual question here. But obviously, in '23, it kind of was a bit of a challenging year, right? You had the macro and rate uncertainty. You had the pending deal. Just as we think about kind of at the onset of '24 here, assuming that the Lakeland deal closes at the end of the quarter here. What -- how do you kind of attack the strategic priority list? What are some of the top -- on the other side of that, where do you guys focus? What should we be mindful of, as you guys move past the rate hikes and the pending deal?\nAnthony Labozzetta: I mean I can give you some color on that. I mean, first, arching back to '23 and see that our Provident team, despite all the delays with the merger and so much work that we put into it, still managed to do a fair job producing some good results. I think when we look into '24, we're optimistic that we'll get the deal closed as soon as possible, and then our focus will be on a number of things. One, primarily, is looking at our business lines and figuring out how we deepen and share across both the organizations since we have complementary services, and building our businesses would be a big focus, principally, on the funding side. I think, individually, I think both Lakeland and us are focused on growing our funding base. And together, I think we're going to look to deepen that. Lastly, I think we've spent a good amount of calories preparing this bank for it to be $25 billion already. And I think the remaining -- putting together these two banks, achieving our efficiencies, getting it ready technologically as we move into our future. I think those are the things that we're going to be paying a lot of attention to pricing disciplines and things of that nature. But a big focus on building our businesses, operational efficiency. And again, I think we're going to have the combined team that's going to be more than capable of rising to that challenge. So I'm excited and optimistic once we get this deal closed.\nMichael Perito: That was perfect. Thanks, Tony. Good update. Appreciate you guys taking my question. Have a good weekend.\nTom Lyons: Thank you. You too.\nAnthony Labozzetta: Thank you.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the call over to Tony Labozzetta for closing remarks.\nAnthony Labozzetta: Thank you. Thank you, everyone, for joining the call. As we all know, '23 -- 2023 was a very difficult year. I think as we enter '24, as I mentioned earlier, I think we're all optimistic that we're going to get the merger closed and focus on building our businesses and the efficiencies I mentioned. The team is ready to meet those challenges, and I look forward to talking to you in the quarter and speaking again in the future. Thank you very much and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Welcome to the Oxford Lane Capital Corp announces net asset value and selected financial results for the Third Fiscal Quarter. My name is Adam and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] I will now hand the floor to CEO Jonathan Cohen to begin. So, Jonathan, please go ahead when you are ready.\nJonathan Cohen: Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Oxford Lane Capital Corp Third Fiscal Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. I'm joined today by Saul Rosenthal, our president; Bruce Rubin, our chief financial officer; and Joe Kupka, our Managing Director. Bruce, could you open the call with the disclosure regarding forward-looking statements?\nBruce Rubin: Sure, Jonathan. Today's conference call is being recorded. An audio replay of the call will be available for 30 days. Replay information is included in our press release that was issued earlier this morning. Please note, that this call is the property of Oxford Lane Capital Corp. Any unauthorized rebroadcast of this call in any form is strictly prohibited. At this point, please direct your attention to the customary disclosure of this morning's press release regarding forward-looking information. Today's conference call includes forward-looking statements and projections that reflect the company's current views with respect to, among other things, future events and financial performance. We ask that you refer to our most recent filings with the SEC for important factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these projections. We do not undertake to update our forward-looking statements unless required to do so by law. During this call, we will use terms defining the earnings release and also refer to non-GAAP measures. For definitions and reconciliations to GAAP, please refer to our earnings release posted on our website at www.oxfordlayingcapital.com. With that, I'll turn the presentation back to Jonathan.\nJonathan Cohen: Thank you, Bruce. On December 31st, 2023, our net asset value per share stood at $4.82 compared to a net asset value of $4.81 per share as of September 30th. For the quarter ended December, we recorded GAAP total investment income of approximately $79.2 million, representing an increase of approximately $4.8 million from the prior quarter. The quarter's GAAP total investment income consisted of approximately $73.6 million from our CLO equity and CLO warehouse investments and approximately $5.7 million from our CLO debt investments and from other income. Oxford Lane reported GAAP net investment income of approximately $48.7 million or $0.23 per share for the quarter ended December, compared to approximately $44.8 million or $0.23 per share for the quarter ended September 30th. Our core net investment income was approximately $82.7 million or $0.39 per share for the quarter ended December compared with approximately $79.7 million or $0.41 per share for the quarter ended September. For the quarter ended December, we recorded net unrealized appreciation on investments of approximately $6.7 million and net realized losses of approximately $3.1 million or $0.02 net per share. We had a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of approximately $52.4 million or $0.25 per share for the third fiscal quarter. As of December 31st, the following metrics applied. We note that none of these metrics represented a total return to shareholders. The weighted average yield of our CLO debt investments at current cost was 16.6%, down from 18.5% as of September 30th. The weighted average effective yield of our CLO equity investments at current cost was 16.5%, up from 16.3% as of September 30th. The weighted average cash distribution yield of our CLO equity investments at current cost was 24%, down from 25% as of September 30th. We note that the cash distribution yields calculated on our CLO equity investments are based on the cash distributions we received or which we were entitled to receive at each respective period end. During the quarter ended December, we issued a total of approximately 10.8 million shares of our common stock, pursuant to an at-the-market offering, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $52.2 million. During the quarter-ended December, we made additional CLO investments of approximately $113.9 million and we received approximately $30.2 million from sales and repayments. On January 25th, our Board of Directors declared monthly stock distributions of $0.08 per share for each of the months ending April, May, and June of 2024. With that, I'll turn the call over to our Managing Director, Joe Kupka. Joe?\nJoe Kupka: Thanks, Jonathan. During the quarter ended December 31, 2023, U.S. loan market performance improved versus the prior quarter. U.S. loan prices, as defined by the Morningstar LSTA U.S. Leverage Loan Index, increased from 95.56% as of September 30th to 96.23% as of December 31st. The increase in U.S. loan prices led to an approximate six-point increase in median U.S. CLO equity net asset values. Additionally, we observed loan pools within CLO portfolios marginally increase their weighted average spreads to 372 basis points compared to 370 basis points last quarter. Despite the increase in loan prices, the 12-month trailing default rate for the loan index increased to 1.5% by principal amount at the end of the quarter from 1.3% at the end of September. Additionally, the distress ratio, defined as the percentage of loans with a price below 80% of par, ended the quarter at 4.5% compared to approximately 4.4% at the end of September. CLO new issuance during the quarter totaled approximately $32 billion, an increase of $4 billion from the prior quarter. The $116 billion of issuance in 2023 trailed the $129 billion of issuance in 2022. However, CLO liabilities have continued to tighten through the new year, which should improve new issue arbitrage and issuance going forward. Oxford Lane continued to be active during the quarter. While most of our activity took place in the secondary market this quarter, we added one new issued CLO equity investment, one new issued CLO debt investment, and one new warehouse during the quarter. Our investment strategy during the quarter was to engage in relative value trading and to lengthen the weighted average reinvestment period of Oxford Lane's CLO equity portfolio. In the current market environment, we intend to continue to utilize an opportunistic and unconstrained investment strategy across U.S. CLO equity debt and warehouses as we look to maximize our long-term total return. And as a permanent capital vehicle, we have historically been able to take a longer-term view towards our investment strategy. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jonathan.\nJonathan Cohen: Thanks Joe. Additional information about Oxford Lane's third quarter performance has been uploaded to our website www.oxfordlanecapital.com. And with that, operator, we're happy to open the call up for any questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Now our first question today comes from Mickey Schleien from Ladenburg. Mickey, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nMickey Schleien: Yes, good morning, everyone. Jonathan, in the prepared remarks, I think you mentioned that CLO debt liability spreads are compressing. What are your expectations for that trend to continue in order to offset the decline in leverage loan spreads, which are also compressing and thereby protecting the arbitrage this year?\nJonathan Cohen: We don't really have a view, Mickey. I mean, that's more of a macro factor. And in terms of the forward pricing outlook for CLO debt tranches, which in turn, as you rightly note, feeds into the quality of a new issue arbitrage and therefore the robustness of the forward calendar. We'd obviously like to see those things happen, but we have no particular insight as to whether they will.\nMickey Schleien: Okay. If I can follow up then, what are your expectations for the portfolios CLO investments that are beyond their reinvestment period in terms of the ability to have those called now that spreads are tightening, and what proportion of those investments are you in a control position?\nJonathan Cohen: Sure. We've already begun that process, just taking advantage of rising NAVs and the tightening liabilities. So, we're starting to have those discussions kind of a case-by-case basis depending on the current status of the CLO. We're going to look to call some deals, reset when we can, and kind of take it case-by-case. Obviously, regarding your first question, there's going to be this push and pull on the market as a lot of the post-reinvestment CLOs try to get something done. So I think we'll be range-bound, but we kind of take what the market gives us in terms of when we want to reset first call.\nMickey Schleien: I understand and my last question, what sort of average recovery rate assumption are you using in the portfolio to calculate your estimated yields? And how has the decline in the rate of those recoveries impacted that assumption?\nJonathan Cohen: Sure, Mickey. I don't think we have historically disclosed those figures publicly, but in any case, it's a range. I mean, as we're calculating those likelihoods, we're looking at a range of possibilities and probabilities that are in turn dependent on, in some cases, the individual portfolio compositions of the underlying collateral pools and the structure of the indentures themselves. So it isn't as if we have sort of a single calculation that fits every profile. We've got a range of calculations that we hope allow us to make good decisions around a very wide array of different CLO profiles.\nMickey Schleien: Okay. That's it for me this morning. Thank you.\nJonathan Cohen: Thank you, Mickey, very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Matt Howlett from B. Riley Securities. Matt, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Howlett: Good morning, everyone. This is Michael Schafer on for Matt. Notice cash flow diversion down a little bit over half. I'm curious if you could detail the trend there? What that looks like quarter to date. Thank you.\nBruce Rubin: Yeah, sure. So we had a large payer in particular that kind of -- just through the self-curing mechanisms of the CLO in combination with improving market conditions turned off its diversion, so started to pay. It's hard to project out diversions for next quarter, a lot of it [Multiple Speakers]\nJonathan Cohen: Right, we generally don't do that, but as you say, we were down about half in terms of the quantum of diversion quarter-over-quarter.\nMichael Schafer: Thank you.\nJonathan Cohen: Thank you very much. Thank you for your question.\nOperator: I show no further questions. Now I'll turn the call back over to Jonathan Cohen, CEO.\nJonathan Cohen: Wonderful. Well, thank you very much. I'd like to thank everyone who participated in this call and everyone who's listening on the replay of the call for their interest and their participation. We look forward to speaking to you again soon. Thanks very much.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor. For more information see our T&C."

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Steve Keenan, Olin's Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nSteve Keenan: Thank you, Andria. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before we begin, let me remind you that this discussion, along with the associated slides and the question-and-answer session that follows, will include statements regarding estimates or expectations of future performance. Please note that these are forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projected. Some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ from our projections are described without limitations in the Risk Factors section of our most recent Form 10-K, and in yesterday's fourth quarter's earnings press release. A copy of today's transcription slides will be available on our website in the Investors section under Past Events. Our earnings press release and other financial data and information are available under Press Releases. With me this morning are Scott Sutton, Olin's CEO; and Todd Slater, Olin's CFO. I'll now turn the call over to Scott Sutton to make some brief remarks, after which, we will be happy to take your questions.\nScott Sutton: Thanks Steve, and good morning to all. In the fourth quarter, the Olin team delivered the four items that were promised, which were $210 million of adjusted EBITDA overcoming a negative $100 million EBITDA impact from our purposeful value accelerator initiative. Stopping the decline of ECU values as a result of our value accelerator initiative, completing the remaining purchase of 10% of our outstanding equity in 2023, and setting the company up for a 2024 that is better than 2023. We start that set up by making the first quarter of the New Year better than the fourth quarter of the past year. We are also very pleased that outside of the minor purchase price for the White Flyer acquisition, Olin's net debt at the end of 2023 was essentially the same as the net debt at the beginning of 2023. Since this could well be my last Olin earnings call. I wanted to remind everyone that Olin has a very unique value creation equation of lifting people to a higher level of fulfillment, delivering value on a contemporary basis through a novel idea pipeline and practicing absolute leadership in commerce. This unique value equation opens a long runway to a very positive future and our leadership team will take Olin there. The earnings and cash flow power of Olin is huge. So Andrea, that concludes my opening remarks. And now we can proceed to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets.\nArun Viswanathan: So I guess, I just wanted to ask first on the guidance. So, it looks like you're expecting some growth in '24. How do you see that proceeding? Looks like your Q1 guidance is a little bit below where we were expecting. So, I know that you're implementing the value accelerator initiative. So, maybe you can just kind of walk us through some of the growth you expect, as you move through the quarters in '24?\nScott Sutton: Good morning, Arun. Happy to do that. I mean, we're really forecasting some profit growth, right. And if you just walk through the three businesses, and I'll just start with Winchester. I mean, we are right in the middle of doubling our military business and that is on-track both domestically and internationally. In the commercial side of that business, demand stays rather high. And on top of that, we have the White Flyer acquisition for a full year. And on top of that, there's going to be a shortage of propellant across the industry this year and Winchester is well-positioned to take advantage of that. So, we feel really good about the profit growth in Winchester. Look, in Epoxy, it's much more a self-help story. We're not necessarily anticipating demand growth, but clearly the restructuring work that we did is applicable for a whole year. Our focus on systems is working. We don't have to clean up inventory as much as we did in 2023. And we're going to work on the illegal flow of products coming from Asia as well. So, then Arun, you really get to the biggest business CAPV, which I'll just remind you has super fundamentals as you look out in the future. But it's all about turning around the value of the ECU. And that's the initiative we're running now. We have a Slide number 4 that gives some indications that we're having some success. I would say even on top of that, there's less volume entering global trade flows today. Some customers are restarting assets that have been down. So, even in that business, we expect Q1 to be larger than Q4, and we expect Q2 to be better than Q1 as well.\nArun Viswanathan: And then if I could just ask, is there any update on the search for new CEO [indiscernible]?\nScott Sutton: Look, Arun, I mean, I really don't have an update on that. And I'm really sorry for that, because look, our shareholders and our Olin women and men, who have really built this value for those shareholders, they deserve a lot better than that from me. But I'm out of the process. That process is 100% run buy our independent board members only. What I can say is to the best of my knowledge, I'm not aware of any offer being extended out there yet to any candidate.\nOperator: The next question comes from Hassan Ahmed of Alembic Capital.\nHassan Ahmed: Question just wanted to sort of go back to the value accelerator initiative. I mean, you were very specific in talking about limiting your market participation till February 2024. What gives you the confidence with regards to that sort of a timeline that you'll start sort of potentially seeing a positive inflection there on after, particularly keeping in mind the macro housing the way it is and the like?\nScott Sutton: Look, we think that's about the right time to make sure that this gets substantially turned around. I mean, already and again, I'm kind of referring back to the Slide number 4 right? We've seen the indicators of success. Certainly, in our business, we are having caustic price increases effective January 1st and even a bit before that already EDC export pricing has lift it significantly, but for the -- some of the public trade indices, that's still just projection, though it's their projection, on our projection now, but we do need to make sure that materializes. So look, I mean, this as a real game of momentum and third derivatives and second derivatives. And we're just going to make sure that we deliver a bit more behind that momentum and that's why we're extending it a bit into the first quarter.\nHassan Ahmed: And just wanted to get a bit more sort of quantitatively specific about the 2024 guidance that you gave. I mean, you're sort of alluding to north of $1.3 billion in EBITDA in 2024. And if I were to just use sort of Q4 as a starting point, you did $210 million in EBITDA in Q4. So I annualized that and you're at $840 million right? And to get to north of $1.3 billion, you need an incremental call it $460 million in EBITDA right? So I'm just trying to understand where that increment really comes from. I mean, I know that in the slides that you guys presented, you referred to the sort of -- I mean, the value sort of enhancement initiative being call it a $100 million a quarter worth of a penalty. So is it primarily you guys sort of stopping to partake in that initiative post February, and most of that EBITDA coming from there? Or are you sort of looking for some margin help from the market as well?\nScott Sutton: Yes. I mean, sure. I mean, hopefully, you'll give us a little bit on Winchester, and the fact that you broke over repeat Epoxy being a zero. So, I get your question for sure. I would also think a little bit about some of the math even behind this. We took our operating rate down to roughly 50% from around 60% in the fourth quarter and that was $100 million penalty. So, you might been imagine that as those rates very slowly creep up to match customers coming back online that's sort of an equation for where you might be, $100 million penalty for one quarter to change the rates from 50% to 60%. If everyone's paying attention, they'll understand the math behind our operating leverage exactly. And it doesn't take very much there to add $100 million or a couple of $100 million or even $1 billion as things get better maybe in 2025.\nOperator: The next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov of KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nAleksey Yefremov: Scott, you talked about January 1st caustic soda price increases. Can you discuss on were those mostly, monthly customers or quarterly contracts or maybe spot and what is your outlook for caustic next few months?\nScott Sutton: Yes. Hey, Aleksey. Yes, I mean, look, I would say it's some of all of that. In fact, even though we put January 1st, some of that success happened early, earlier than that. And while it's across a number of customers, I mean, please understand that we still have a lot of work to do there. And caustic is a business that is still heavily tied to a trade index. And that trade index in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter showed a decline. So, our pricing in the first quarter is going to change by the difference between those prior two quarters. So, we still have to get by that hurdle, and that's why in the last quarterly earnings call, we said you're really going to see this start to materialize in a bigger way in our second quarter results.\nAleksey Yefremov: And on the chlorine side, I mean, there's a consultant's view of declines for the year. What is your outlook and level of confidence in the outlook for the next few quarters as well?\nScott Sutton: Yes. Well, I mean the chlorine, and chlorine derivative sides are still the weaker side of the ECU. But what I will say is that, Olin's average chlorine pricing in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter absolutely goes up. Some of that is because we've been able to renegotiate pricing in some contracts that expired at the end of the year, some of that is because, we ran this value accelerator initiative, and the only way to pull out of the market was actually to pull out of some of our higher price business because it was more spot in nature, but at least on our base business that continues without a contract change, that pricing doesn't go down either. Nothing is getting worse in terms of chlorine pricing.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Byrne of Bank of America.\nSteve Byrne: Scott, I was curious about this prolonged trough in PVC demand. Is that representing a bit of a challenge for you to negotiate maybe a partnering opportunity downstream post the end of the Dow agreement in another year?\nScott Sutton: I mean, look, I do think it's extended it some right? But of course, with the change in our relationship with Dow at Freeport in 2025. We get a lot of excess capability coming back in our hands and we'll have to decide what to do there and everyone already knows that that's quite accretive for us for sure no matter what we do. So that comes available. I would say in addition to that. We have a tremendous amount of VCM that's going through a pipeline to one customer and all of that ends in 2030 as well. So we're getting close to being able to match up with a different PVC operator. So instead of spending $6 billion on a completely integrated world scale facility, someone has the ability to spend 20% of that to get in business in a world scale PVC plant. So I think the timing is okay. We wish it was a bit faster. But you're right, I mean the situation in the world right now has just slowed down some of those activities.\nSteve Byrne: And then just given this uncertainty about the new CEO, Scott, are you opposed to staying there in that seat or staying longer depending on this transition?\nScott Sutton: No, I'm not.\nOperator: The next question comes from Joshua Spector of UBS.\nChris Perrella: It's Chris Perrella on for Josh. Question, on the follow-up, I saw that the share repurchases slowed in the fourth quarter. What's the outlook for share repurchases for 2024?\nTodd Slater: We committed to repurchase approximately 10% of our standing shares in 2023, and that was consistent with what we achieved. We were relatively steady buyer through the year. We bought a little less than the fourth quarter, but consistent with the guidance that we had provided. As you look at our leverage free cash flow for 2024, you should expect us to primarily deploy that cash towards share repurchases. Our strong investment grade balance sheet and cash flow, enable Olin to continue to deploy our cash toward repurchasing our shares.\nChris Perrella: And then a follow-up, as you take the break-off the value accelerator initiative and you raised operating rates starting in March with as the current plan. I thought there'd be a larger step up in EBITDA earnings for the Chlor Alkali business. And I'm just curious, given the puts and takes there, it seems like it's not up much that $100 million penalty should be coming back a bit faster. Can you just kind of walk through how that penalty lifts?\nScott Sutton: Yes. I mean, Chris, look, it's a really good observation. I mean, I would just keep two things in mind. I mean, number one, we're continuing to run that initiative for up to two-thirds of the first quarter. But also on top of that, it goes back to that caustic pricing phenomena that I talked about whereby the first quarter pricing that we print is determined by the difference between the fourth quarter and the third quarter, and that's already known to be a drop. So, we have to overcome that as well.\nChris Perrella: All right. So, it's just a lag in the contract pricing?\nScott Sutton: Exactly.\nOperator: The next question comes from Frank Mitsch of Fermium Research.\nFrank Mitsch: Interesting on the parlay chart reaching a high of 25% in the fourth quarter. Obviously, part of that is the initiative to ramp back your own operating rates. Where does that stand now here in January and what are your expectations for that metric through the quarter?\nScott Sutton: Yes. Hey, Frank. Yes, I mean, you're right. I mean it\u2019s -- I think it's very interesting that for 25% of our volumes were out there selling, we were buying those from third parties. And it might just tell you about the strength of Olin that we can do that. We can go run our assets at 50% utilization. We can take care of all those items and still have positive levered free cash flow even in the fourth quarter. So, I mean, thanks for the observation on that or the hints of the observation. I mean, I would say that, look, we're still doing a lot of that, because we're still running that initiative. I do think through the year, as we very slowly and incrementally may lift rates a little bit, you might see that percentage decline back some. We're unlikely to be at a 25% purchase of all of our volumes from other parties over a long period of time, it will probably settle at something lower than that.\nFrank Mitsch: And then as you assess the underlying market demands by region, you had indicated the last time that things were rather slow and so forth. How is it standing here in January, and what are your expectations? What is actually embedded in terms of underlying demand? If you think about '24 being better than '23 overall?\nScott Sutton: Yes. Well, I mean look in Winchester there's a demand increase in military just sort of put that one to bed. We haven't planned on any demand increase in Epoxy, right. That's a self-help type of work. Even in Chlor Alkali, very limited demand recovery. But I will just say that sentiment is a little bit better here at the start of the year, customers are restarting. Two of our larger customers that have large off-takes have been down for many weeks and in fact they are restarting. There is some light confidence, I'd say in homebuilders where at least maybe that doesn't go the wrong way. So there's just not a lot of strength in demand built in our outlook, Frank.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kevin McCarthy of Vertical Research Partners.\nKevin McCarthy: Scott, I'd welcome your updated thoughts on the shape of the Epoxy cycle. If I look at Slide 8, it appears as though your prices eroded in 4Q versus 3Q. How do you think that will trend in the first quarter? And then, I'm also interested to hear your thoughts on Epoxy's in Europe. We're reading about disruptions in trade routes relative to the Red Sea and purchasing managers seem to want to kind of get ahead of those longer lead times and increased tensions and friction and so forth. How do you see the next quarter or two shaping up for Epoxy?\nScott Sutton: Look, I mean, we've announced price increase and we're getting some price increase. And in fact, if you really looked at what's happened over the last few months has been more of a wash tub bottom. It really hasn't declined further. In fact, even the trade publications now are saying that this is a bottom. Believe me, we absolutely say that this is a bottom. And the disruptions for trade routes that is starting to have an impact, particularly in Europe. So there's a lot of momentum for the start of lifting prices again through Epoxy. It's going to be slow though. I think, what you'll end up seeing us do is sort of take that wash tub and profit up a little bit. I wouldn't expect something really, really fast there, but we're going to change the slope of that curve.\nKevin McCarthy: And then curious on EDC, we've seen those prices percolate higher notwithstanding weakness in downstream PVC resin. How much headroom is there before you kind of run into that PVC ceiling, so to speak?\nScott Sutton: Well, I mean, particularly the export PVC pricing is not good and you've seen EDC lift, but there's still a substantial gap left even when PVC is this low. And that's one of the focuses we've had and one of the initiatives we've had is to try to close that gap. And we were never really successful at closing that gap. So there's still room there to move it some more relative to PVC.\nKevin McCarthy: And if it is the last call, Scott, congrats on all that you've been able to do with the company in less than three years and look forward to keeping in touch.\nScott Sutton: No, thanks a lot. It's really not me though. It's this team and this employee group.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank.\nDavid Begleiter: Scott, just on the Blue Water Alliance, can update us on how it performed last year and what's the expected EBITDA contribution in 2024?\nScott Sutton: Yes, I mean, look, I probably won't give a forecast of the EBITDA contribution. But I mean, clearly that does appear indirectly in our financials and it wasn't a positive contributor in 2023, which was actually the expectation, right. It's sort of the first year. There's a lot of purposes for Blue Water, we don't intend for it to be a wild direct contributor of profit. But the value to time one and the value in the overall product levels of Olin is there. I mean part of our parlay work that we're doing now and we just had that discussion being 25% of our business it is associated with Blue Water. So, it will likely improve this year, but it's not going to be a major direct contributor relative to the size of the rest of our business.\nDavid Begleiter: And just again on Epoxy, what's the path back to mid-cycle earnings given the amount of oversupply in the marketplace today?\nScott Sutton: Well, I guess it depends on what you call mid-cycle in that business. But I'll just say it's a multiyear path and maybe leave it at that.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mike Leithead of Barclays.\nMike Leithead: First question on Winchester. You've obviously talked Scott, about the earnings improvement likely this year. Could you first remind us just how big military is relative to your overall kind of sales mix in this business? And second, it is an election year. Does that normally change commercial order patterns or do you see that impacting at all commercial sales volumes?\nScott Sutton: The military side of that business now has become about as big in rough terms as the commercial side of that business. In fact, in the third quarter of 2023, it was actually bigger than the commercial business for the first time in history. So, I think a good way to think of it is, it's sort of half and half from a sales perspective. It's not quite as profitable as the commercial business, but that's roughly the sizing of it. Yes. What was the second part of the question?\nMike Leithead: The presidential election.\nScott Sutton: Yes. I mean that kind of uncertainty along with other things that are out there in the marketplace. So I mentioned this challenge on propellant supply to the whole industry. Those two things coming together are likely to cause a run on ammunition.\nMike Leithead: And then second question, I want to parse apart, what are the comments or bullets you have in the slide deck, Slide 4? Well, I think you said customer requests for merchant chlorine has increased. Should we interpret that that customers are coming to you asking for more products, but not at a price or an economics you're willing to sell at? Or can you maybe expand upon that a bit?\nScott Sutton: Yes. I think the way to interpret that is that when we pull back from the market some just because we're running our initiative, we're not going to participate in a poor quality market. After we did that, that caused some customers, some not even the same customers that we may have pulled back from to come ask for more volume. Again, it's just an indication that we can have an impact by taking that kind of action. And it's an indication that we had the opportunity to turn back on some of these assets though at a very, very incremental amount only and do some additional business.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mike Sison of Wells Fargo.\nMike Sison: I guess just to clarify, if you would need to get your operating rates in calves between 60% and 70% at some point, maybe the second quarter and beyond to get to your guidance of $1.3 billion or better. And I mean, in demand there to do that, I guess, it's a follow-up question or do you need demand to get better to do that?\nScott Sutton: Yes. Well, I don't know that we need to get back to the levels that you spoke of. I mean, remember Winchester and Epoxy are going to do better and we expect CAPV to do incrementally better as well. I think adding anything back to our rates, maybe below the numbers that you spoke of gets us there. When you take that in combination with the fact that look we don't have another $100 million penalty from not being able to run our VCM unit for a whole quarter, for example. So when you put those two things together, I don't think we need to get there. By 2025, I think we need to be in the 60s.\nMike Sison: And then what -- I'm just curious, what would prevent you from moving or operating itself? I mean, I know the consultants, they have ECU margins kind of down sequentially. They might not necessarily be right. But what would prompt you not to be able to raise your operating rates heading into 2Q?\nScott Sutton: Yes. Well, if we weren't having success moving product values, then we would keep running this initiative. But we're having success changing the direction of our product pricing.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan.\nJeff Zekauskas: Earlier in the call, you spoke of a large contract that can end in 2030. Did that customer indicate that they didn't wish to renew?\nScott Sutton: What I would say is that's the natural expiration of that contract. And we're currently in a dispute with a very significant value lift opportunity. So we'll just have to see where that goes by 2030.\nJeff Zekauskas: And then secondly, can you just compare general demand conditions in the cost caustic chain to the chlorine chain. And in your curtailment of production, are you making a larger difference to the chlorine side or to the caustic side and why?\nScott Sutton: Yes. Well, I mean, right now, Jeff, the chlorine and chlorine derivative side is weaker for us. So, we generally set our participation according to that weaker side. And so we're having an impact. But more than likely, the bigger part of the impact will be on the stronger side because you end up really shorting that demand profile more.\nOperator: The next question comes from Vincent Anderson of Stifel.\nVincent Anderson: So, maybe you have a different view, but it looks like China is probably still planning a fair amount of capacity up and down the Epoxy value chain over the next few years. So, to me at least it would appear that trade protections might be necessary even if we did see some amount of demand recovery. So, I guess to turn that into a question, are you still considering trade cases in Epoxy? And how important is sort of your renewed focus on fleshing out your derivative portfolio as a balance to the operating leverage on the base resin assets?\nScott Sutton: Yes, sure. I mean, no, we're absolutely doing more than considering that, right. I mean, look, effectively this is illegal product trade flows coming into both Europe and the U.S. And this has to be stopped. And for some of the reasons that you said, it's likely to continue. So, we're absolutely going to pursue that. I think in terms of getting rates up, we've reduced our on the ground capacity quite a bit and we're using our systems portfolio to get some operating leverage back across our base resin. I think that was the second part of your question.\nVincent Anderson: Yeah, it was. And very helpful. Thank you. If I could ask one other one, maybe too early on this, but we're reading about the Chinese ramping up capacity of sodium ion battery production. I'm curious if you've seen any meaningful change in their sodium markets, whether that's coming from the caustic side or maybe they're using soda ash, but just anything you can shed a light on because it's still a bit of a black box on our end?\nScott Sutton: Yes. And I probably can't help that much on that specific of an item, right? But what I can say is the ramp up of battery production and battery recycling is probably the largest growth item we have across our Chlor Alkali portfolio. There is a demand for more caustic in many of those applications. There is also an additional demand for hydrochloric acid in those as well. So, it's probably the premier growth item over the next 10 years in this business.\nOperator: The next question comes from Matthew Blair of TPH.\nMatthew Blair: So Slide 8 shows caustic holding as a strong side of the ECU again this quarter. I think in the past you said you like it when that gap is pretty wide. Could you talk about what you're seeing in the market now? And is that gap widening out or is it narrowing?\nScott Sutton: Look, give me a little clarification. I missed the gap between what two things.\nMatthew Blair: The gap between chlorine and caustic and ECU and which is the strong side and which is the weak side?\nScott Sutton: First of all, Olin does do better when there's a difference in the supply demand profile on the chlorine side of the ECU versus the caustic side of the ECU. Just because we can act on one versus the other. The only challenge that we really that is when both are bad and they're equal. That's the hardest profile for Olin to act on. So we don't have a problem with one being weak and one being stronger. That's the way we're set up now. Caustic is stronger, flooring is weak, but overlaying that is just general weakness and that's why our earnings are down.\nMatthew Blair: And then, I thought it was interesting. You mentioned that in general Winchester is a bright spot and talked about military being a big opportunity. I think the slides mentioned that military demand was actually down a little bit in the fourth quarter, quarter-over-quarter, even given this period of global instability? What are you seeing in Q1? Is that starting to rebound?\nScott Sutton: Yes. And I understand your comment. That was just a sequential issue and it's really only order pattern related and delivery related. A lot of those deliveries into the military application are very large and they're very discrete. So that's only an order pattern issue. Again, I would just compare year-on-year-on-year and there's substantial lifts year-on-year-on-year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley.\nVincent Andrews: On the cash taxes, my recollection is that those that increase was also supposed to be the case last year and I think you mentioned defer into this year. So is this year that increase I think is $80 million is that definitive for 2024 or is there some chance to further defer those?\nTodd Slater: I wish, I could sound very optimistic and say there's a chance to defer. I don't believe that will be the case. And we would expect that $80 million we paid out roughly during the middle of this year.\nVincent Andrews: And then also on that same Slide 9 and the primary uses for cash flow, the third one being the Alliance and JV opportunities. Is there sort of a rough amount you could suggest that could go towards those this year or max amount?\nTodd Slater: At this point, they would be very small. We do have a hydrogen joint venture that we do have a little bit more that will be paid during this year. So that is a small number relative to any of those cash flow numbers.\nOperator: The next question comes from John Roberts of Mizuho.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you, and best wishes as well, Scott. I think acetone prices spiked during the quarter. Is that just the normal co-product dynamics with the weak BPA market for Epoxies or is there something else going on there?\nScott Sutton: Yes. I mean principally that's it. You're right. I mean phenol acetone co-production a little bit like chlorine caustic. And we sort of transferred some of our model that we run in the ECU world into our phenol acetone production and marketing scheme. And so you've seen us take advantage of that and get some value out of assets.\nJohn Roberts: And then at Lake City, do you think there are any political risks to being able to use the excess capacity for commercial production? The New York Times had a pretty high profile article during the quarter?\nScott Sutton: No. I don't think there's any risk there at all. I mean, what I will say is that, look, I mean, there's always this sort of backdoor play to try to go after the second amendment of the constitution in the U.S., and that's what that is. And those kind of things are not likely to be very successful. I just go back to the fact that probably in this country, there's 26,000 gun laws on the books. Still sports shooting is the largest participant sport in the country just below exercise. Okay? And coming after ammunition, there's probably an unsuccessful road that some might follow there.\nOperator: The next question comes from Roger Spitz of Bank of America.\nRoger Spitz: I'm assuming you've idled some of your electrolyzers or perhaps full trains to get to the 50% operating rates. Will there be material restart cost as you move your operating rates up? I guess membranes can be finicky or you mainly idling just your asbestos diaphragm spectralizers?\nScott Sutton: No, there's no incremental cost. We can move those up and down rather quickly. And in fact just a smaller point for you that's pretty interesting is the diaphragm systems relative to the membrane systems are very easy to go up and down. That's an advantage of asbestos diaphragms or other kinds of diaphragms relative to membrane system, very easy to turn on and off.\nRoger Spitz: And secondly, historically, ammunition sales, commercial ammunition sales have been higher when the Democrats are have the administration versus Republicans. Do you have any view of how much EBITDA is in Winchester attributed to the fact that we currently have a Democratic administration?\nScott Sutton: Well, I would say not really. I would say it's more attributed to the fact that there's at least 15 million new participants doing sport shooting in this country and every month, I forget how many, maybe someone will tell me how many months in a row that the mix background checks have been above 1 million guns a month, but it's like 40 million or 50 million maybe even more. I just can't remember the number and that trend continues.

        "article_content": " \n\n Norfolk Southern  Corporation (NYSE: NYSE:NSC) discussed its fourth-quarter performance and future outlook in its latest earnings call, revealing a strategic focus on improving service, safety, and productivity despite recent challenges. The company reported a decline in revenues and adjusted operating income for the quarter, attributing the downturn to a major derailment, network disruptions, and a tough macroeconomic environment. \nHowever, there were positive developments, including a 42% reduction in the mainline accident rate and the best intermodal service performance in three years. Looking ahead, Norfolk Southern plans to drive growth and profitability through a focus on cost reduction, service improvement, and strategic investments.\nNorfolk Southern remains focused on overcoming its current challenges and leveraging its strategic initiatives to achieve sustainable growth and improved profitability. While acknowledging the headwinds faced in 2023, the company is optimistic about its prospects for 2024, with plans to capitalize on expected market recoveries and its ongoing efforts to enhance operational efficiency and service quality.\nOperator: Greetings, and welcome to the Norfolk Southern Corporation Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to introduce Luke Nichols, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Thank you. Mr. Nichols, you may begin.\nLuke Nichols: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Please note that during today's call, we will make certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events or future performance of Norfolk Southern Corporation, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full disclosure of those risks and uncertainties we view as the most important. Our presentation slides are available at norfolksouthern.com in the Investors section, along with the reconciliation of any non-GAAP measures used today to comparable GAAP measures. Turning to Slide 3, it's now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's President and Chief Executive Officer, Alan Shaw.\nAlan Shaw: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Norfolk Southern's fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. Here with me today are Mark George, our Chief Financial Officer; Paul Duncan, our Chief Operating Officer; and Ed Elkins, our Chief Marketing Officer. Last year was historically challenging, with a major derailment to start off the year, followed by network disruptions and compounded by a stubbornly weak freight market. The Eastern Ohio incident tested our resolve. I'm proud that our team responded decisively and responsibly to protect this great franchise and our shareholders, and to address the community's concerns. With an unwavering commitment, we have strengthened our safety and service. We have kept and will continue to keep our promises to make things right in Ohio, to improve our service to our customers, and to make a safe railroad even safer. A crisis allows you to accelerate change, and we acted. This includes a number of positive changes to how we design the network and assemble trains with measurable results. As we show on Slide 4, our improvement in safety is already being highlighted by a dramatic 42% reduction in our mainline accident rate in 2023. 2023 was also historically important for Norfolk Southern because we began to implement and advance our new strategy to position our business for sustainable growth and success. The Intermodal Service Composite chart on the right side of Slide 4 tells an important story that speaks to the clear gains we have made in both resiliency and service, following significant strides in service in 2022. With our investments in resiliency through leadership plan and resources, we demonstrated the ability to execute our strategy to run a safer railroad that delivers a compelling service product to our customers and handles increased business, a balanced approach to safely delivering service, productivity and growth. We overcame multiple significant network disruptions in 2023, and exited the year with the best intermodal service we have delivered in over three years, all while intermodal volume grew 5%. Entering 2024 with a safer and more fluid network that is attracting growth, we have the platform to narrow our focus to specific areas to drive increased productivity, and we are building positive momentum by executing on our strategic vision. Part of that strategic vision is our commitment to industry-competitive margins, and we are determined to deliver on that promise just as we have delivered our promises on service and safety as volumes grew. We will leverage our PSR operating plan with our current resource base to meaningfully improve velocity and resilience within our merchandise network, which accounts for two-thirds of our train starts. As we achieve a high degree of compliance to the plan and merchandise, we will reduce variability, complexity and costs. We are driving that forward now with the results already seen in December and January. It will drive asset velocity that will lead to productivity gains and cost savings. And in 2024, we are targeting a double-digit percentage improvement in terminal dwell, which is a good barometer of the health of our and fluidity of our merchandise network. Paul will go into more detail about how we are planning to build on our success in intermodal, deploying changes to accelerate our merchandise network, which I have noted will be a major source of productivity for Norfolk Southern in 2024 and beyond. To further describe what we are doing to improve profitability and drive smart growth in 2024, Ed will talk about how his team is winning business and pushing hard to negotiate price in excess of inflation. Importantly, we are streamlining our cost structure and eliminating inefficiencies. We invested in 2023 to enhance safety and service. We will see the benefits of this in our cost structure in 2024. We'll take actions this year to reduce costs in other areas. This includes a program to reduce management headcount by roughly 7% to help offset increases in critical operating areas. Our groundbreaking transformation will take time. We recognize the necessary investments in resiliency and service have temporarily increased our cost structure, particularly visible during the trough in this freight cycle. On Slide 5, you'll see we laid out the scenario where during a down cycle, we may modestly underperform in order to be coiled to secure volume and incremental margin when the freight cycle recovers. While we didn't expect 2023 to be a continuation of a soft freight market, coupled with numerous disruptions, we are optimistic that recovery is on the horizon and our investments will yield returns. We will deliver near-term margin improvement as we implement our strategic vision, a balance between safe service, productivity and smart growth. We are on the path to achieve that balance. In the aftermath of the derailment and network disruptions, we have improved safety and service in a responsible manner and are in securing new business. With a stabilized network and a high degree of compliance to the plan, we will continue to iterate the plan, reducing complexity and enhancing executability and balance. All of this will unlock productivity and fluidity, which, in-line with our strategy, will allow us to attract more volume at accretive incremental margins and deliver top-tier revenue and earnings growth at industry-competitive margins. With strong franchise advantages that will serve us well as we move through this economic cycle, we are poised for a bright future as we balance safe service, productivity and growth. I'll turn it over to Mark and the rest of the team, who will add some context around the timing and magnitude of our planned improvements in performance and profitability.\nMark George: Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 7 with an update on our costs related to the Eastern Ohio derailment. During the fourth quarter, we reached a significant milestone with the bulk of the soil remediation being completed. It's an encouraging achievement, however, as you'll note, we incurred $137 million charge in the quarter, which related to an extension the timeline for ongoing testing as well as additional work that will be completed in nearby streams. There was another $89 million incurred in legal costs and other fees. But of note, we received $76 million of insurance recoveries, bringing the total recoveries in 2023 to just over $100 million. From a cash perspective, the net outflow in 2023 was $652 million after the insurance recoveries. While we're pleased with our remediation accomplishments, we currently expect ongoing monitoring efforts and cleanup efforts will continue through 2024. There will be additional costs in the future related to legal settlements and fees, although the amounts and timing cannot currently be estimated. Moving to Slide 8, where we illustrate the impact of these fourth quarter results on our results. Our GAAP results are in the first row, while on row two we isolate the accounting to our Q4 financials related to the incident. At the bottom of the chart, you'll note the comparisons of the adjusted results to prior year. I'll be talking about our adjusted results for the remainder of the discussion. Revenues were down nearly 5%, while adjusted operating expense was 3% higher. The adjusted operating ratio for Q4 2023 was 68.8%, which represented a year-over-year deterioration, but notably was a 30 basis point sequential improvement from our third quarter performance. The sequential improvement is encouraging, but we fell short of our expectations as service-related costs did not come down as we anticipated. While our recovery efforts related to the IT outages in late Q3 restored service quickly for our customers and allowed us to handle more business, it costs more money in the form of crew-related expenses that persisted well into the fourth quarter. On an adjusted basis, operating income was down 19% year-over-year. Net income and EPS were down 19% and 17%, respectively. Turning now to Slide 9, adjusted operating expense for the quarter was up $59 million. The increase excluding fuel decline was up $123 million. The largest drivers of the increase were employment growth as well as inflation across all categories. In comp and ben, looking to '24, we plan to keep overall headcount levels flat versus the year end 2023 exit rate with some additional mechanical craft hiring to be offset by upcoming reductions in the non-agreement category that Alan discussed. Purchased services was up due to higher costs associated with technology spend, as well as increased mechanical services, including repairs around our auto fleet as we prepare for growth opportunities in 2024. The increase in rents was driven by short-term locomotive resources and increased car supply for our auto fleet. We expect quarterly rents in 2024 to remain slightly above these fourth quarter levels due to more adverse TTX equity costs and volumetric-related increases, partially offset by benefits coming from improved velocity. The increase in materials relates to locomotive and freight car repairs. Claims were lower year-over-year. Recall that in Q4 2022, we had a large adverse adjustment. The other component is unfavorable, driven mainly by fewer real estate gains. Moving now to Slide 10. Last quarter, we introduced this slide to help investors think about our service costs and resiliency investments, which are two components of our current cost structure. On the left side, we see costs that should not be part of our cost structure and have grown out of service that has not met planned levels, mainly related to recrews and overtime. These costs did not step down as expected in Q4 due to the crew-related costs we incurred to accelerate service recovery for our customers after the IT outages. So, while service has been at strong levels exiting the year, Q1 costs will remain somewhat elevated in part from the cold weather we are seeing here in January. Overall service costs should meaningfully unwind in Q2. On the right hand, we show costs tied to our investments in resiliency, mainly related to additional T&E crews that we have added in locations where we were understaffed, as we position Norfolk Southern to realize outsized growth in revenue and margin in a growing volume environment. Our total T&E headcount is now on an appropriate level that will allow us to absorb volume growth in '24 and beyond. There will be some additional hiring in mechanical crafts that will be offset by reductions in non-agreement positions. The additional craft hires mean that resiliency costs will settle in roughly in the $55 million per quarter range in 2024. Adding those resources will drive benefits over time of being an even safer and higher velocity operation. Moving to Slide 11 and results below operating income, other income of $38 million was up $4 million in the quarter, driven by higher interest income on the extra cash we are carrying ahead of the CSR closing. The adjusted effective tax rate was 19.2% due to a rate adjustment on our deferred state income taxes and tax-free gains on favorable company-owned life insurance. For 2024, we expect our tax rate to be in the usual 23% to 24% range. Turning to Slide 12 and recapping our full-year results. We started the year planning for modest top-line growth that would afford a level of expense growth to help drive our strategic track toward resiliency. The disruptive events of the year and an adverse macro environment upended this. Revenue declined 5%, which was meaningfully affected by about 6 points of pressure from lower fuel surcharge revenue and a sharp year-over-year decline in storage fees. At the same time, OpEx rose 5%, fueled by inflation and investments in our business. As a result, operating income fell 18%, with the operating ratio rising to 67.4%. Favorable below-the-line items and benefits from share repurchases held the EPS decline to 15%. In 2023, free cash flow was $1.4 billion lower than the prior year, representing the impact of the $650 million derailment-related outlays, as well as the lower operating income, coupled with higher CapEx. Shareholder distributions in '23 were $1.8 billion, with two-thirds being driven by our rock solid dividend and the remainder from share repurchase activity. I'll mention that we did issue debt in November and built up our cash balance to $1.6 billion at year-end, as we prepare to fund the strategic CSR purchase that is scheduled to close on March 15. As a result, we will see higher interest expense in 2024 and we will temporarily suspend share repurchases while we absorb the asset and bring our credit metrics back into our target range. It's important to remember that CSR is a highly strategic critical artery in our network, for which we had a rare window to secure and guarantee control of the asset forever. This also enables us to control longer-term costs that could have begun to escalate sharply with the upcoming lease renewal. I'll now hand over to Paul, who can provide an update on our operations.\nPaul Duncan: Thank you, Mark, and good morning. Turning to Slide 15 to begin our operations discussion with safety. We made progress in enhancing safety in 2023. We finished the year with our second best injury rate in eight years, but we are striving for better. We enhanced our conductor training program and continue to leverage our partnership with Atkins Nuclear, a foremost expert in safety across all industries. We also closed 2023 with a 42% reduction in our mainline accident rate and the fewest mainline accidents since 1999. Thank you to all of our craft colleagues and leaders for enhancing safety at Norfolk Southern this last year. While these are very noteworthy accomplishments, we must become even safer. When the major incident in Eastern Ohio happened in early 2023, we were already in the process of reviewing and adjusting our train makeup rules and it was a high priority of mine. We ended up accelerating that work by a lot. What we produced was an even better product than we already had, which helped us make such progress in mainline accidents and we are striving to become even safer. This is the platform for which we can now lever up our train plan to deliver productivity and growth. Though the change in our operating rules was implemented on an accelerated timeline and caused network disruption, we know it was the right move for the long term and we kept our promises to restore fluidity and service levels in the second half of 2023. The future of our operation is very bright and I am proud of the work we did in 2023 on this front to keep our promises. Moving to Slide 16 for further discussion on service levels. We took a modest step backwards to begin the quarter related to the system outages that we experienced, but quickly regained footing and continued our glide path of improvement in November and December. It is important to note that we deliberately chose to deploy additional resources so that we could balance restoring fluidity, while delivering peak volume. We were successful on that front. We delivered a very strong service for our intermodal customers during peak season and pushed overall volumes to their highest levels in over two-and-a-half years as you will hear more about from Ed. But as you heard from Mark, it did result in higher-than-planned service recovery costs in the quarter. We remain sharply focused on reducing those and have actively been unwinding more T&E crew expense in recent weeks in areas such as temporary deployments, overtime, recrews and other crew-related expenses. This has included reducing our intensity of Go Team members deployed on the network. Now that we have made this next step function improvement in intermodal service, we expect to remain there as we transition to leveraging our resources to drive greater productivity and growth. Turning to Slide 17 for a discussion on productivity. We've improved 4% sequentially within workforce productivity and expect an improving glide path to continue. We are driving this in four ways: one, by improving fluidity; two, by maintaining strict discipline and accountabilities to plan compliance in our operation; three, through discrete productivity initiatives that we'll discuss in a moment; and finally, through converting trainees to productive employees. As promised last quarter, we ended the year with 600 conductor trainees. We are now confident with the overall size of our T&E workforce to efficiently serve the growth that is on the horizon. On the locomotive front, referencing our service commentary, miles per day remained lower as we kept additional power and service to jumpstart the network with peak volume. This is an area that will benefit significantly from further improvements in velocity as faster train speeds allow us to drive our locomotives in the terminals on time and send them back out on their scheduled connections. And lastly, fuel efficiency finished flat despite the additional locomotives online, thanks to our initiatives, and this is an area we are intensely focused on improving in 2024. Moving to Slide 18, the next phase of our operational improvement will be marked by enhancing the velocity and resilience within our merchandise network. Recall that our TOP|SPG operating plan, which we launched in 2022, brought further PSR principles to our intermodal network, driving enhancements to container velocity and resilience within intermodal. That successful evolution enabled intermodal service to remain strong throughout 2023, particularly in Q4, where we delivered the best intermodal service in over three years, while delivering on peak season. Now we are building on that success with further enhancements in our merchandise network. First, we are improving our execution and discipline to run with a higher level of planned compliance. We're tying together the improvements we've made around our operational strategy, leadership accountabilities and resource allocation by sweating our assets further and strict execution to the plan. Next, we are leveraging precision train building processes embedded into our terminals to optimize connections and depart trains on time. We're already seeing the benefits that arise from success in driving scheduled network velocity. Our success will be demonstrated by making sustained improvement in terminal dwell, whereas Alan mentioned in his opening remarks, we expect to drive a low-double-digit percentage improvement in 2024 versus 2023. Investors can also track our progress in the AAR (NYSE:AIR) train speed, particularly the subset of manifest train speed, which has an outsized impact on our cost structure as well as merchandise trip plan compliance and car velocity, the outcomes of improving speed, dwell and disciplined execution of plan. Of course, there is always week-to-week noise in these measures, so we would look for improvements in trends on a rolling 12-week basis. On Slide 19, I'd like to provide more detail on how sustaining these velocity improvements will drive down our cost structure. First, we will see reductions in various buckets of T&E-related expense, and that will also help to lower our headcount intensity. Next, as we spin up the flywheel, we'll get cars moving faster, a critical element to scheduled railroading and overall productivity. Having our yards and mainlines more fluid will indicate that cars are flowing unimpeded through the network. This will drive a capacity and productivity dividend within our fleets in our yards and on our mainlines. That in turn will allow us to bring on growth at low incremental cost, lifting overall workforce and locomotive productivity and achieving service resilience that will allow us to take further share from truck. Driving these benefits in our operation by improving the velocity and resilience of the merchandise network will be a key aspect of delivering progress in 2024. Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Ed.\nEd Elkins: Thanks, Paul, and good morning to everybody on the call. Beginning on Slide 21, let's cover our commercial results for the fourth quarter. Overall volume improved 3%, led by growth in intermodal and our automotive markets. Now, despite volume growth, total revenue and revenue per unit declined for the quarter due to lower revenue from fuel surcharge and intermodal storage and fees, along with negative shipment mix within the portfolio continuing from last quarter, as well as headwinds from a weak truck price environment due to the persistent overabundance of capacity. Looking at merchandise, volume was flat compared to the prior period and revenue was challenged by lower revenue from fuel surcharge compared to that prior period. RPU less fuel increased 1% as price gains more than offset the impacts from negative mix. This increase set a new quarterly record for Norfolk Southern and marks the 34 of the last 35 consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth in merchandise RPU less fuel. We're committed to driving value through price, and this commitment is demonstrated through quarterly records set in our automotive market for revenue, revenue less fuel, revenue per unit and revenue per unit less fuel. Let's move to intermodal. Volume in the quarter increased 5% year-over-year with gains in both our domestic and international lines of business. Revenue for intermodal was down 13% year-over-year, primarily driven by significantly lower revenue from storage and fees in the prior period. Also lower fuel prices and an excess supply of available trucks as well as negative mix within our international business impacted revenue per unit negatively. Excluding the impacts of fuel and elevated storage and fees, which are related to supply chain congestion, intermodal RPU declined 1% in the quarter. We're confident our domestic franchise is a coiled spring, positioned to yield strong incremental value as the truck market recovers. Turning to coal. Overall volume increased slightly with strong demand for export more than offsetting declines in our utility coal franchise. The market for utility confronted persistently high stockpiles and low natural gas prices. Coal revenue was down 4% year-over-year with lower commodity prices and lower revenue from fuel surcharge negatively impacting RPU. Now, let's turn to Slide 22 and review results for the full year. Total volume came in at 6.7 million units, a 1% decrease from 2022. Volume declines were most significant in intermodal and our energy-related chemical commodities. On the positive side, lower ocean freight rates, advanced demand for international intermodal and rising vehicle production activity drove growth in our automotive franchise, both of which contributed meaningfully to offsetting larger declines. Revenue for the year was $12.2 billion, down 5%, or $590 million from 2022, driven by lower revenue from fuel surcharge and storage fees, as well as lower volume. I do think it's important to point out, however, that if we exclude the $650 million revenue hit from fuel and storage fees, which is essentially a post-pandemic normalization of those items, underlying revenue was actually positive, even with volume down 1%, which speaks to our commitment to core pricing smart growth. RPU, excluding fuel, intermodal storage and fees, increased 2% as we realized above budget price results in merchandise and in coal. In fact, we set annual records for merchandise revenue, revenue less fuel and RPU less fuel. Objectively, the freight environment in 2023 was soft, with weak demand for goods, lower levels of manufacturing activity, and generally less freight coming in from overseas. These conditions amplified the excess capacity in transportation, pressuring margins and growth opportunities. Our focus throughout the year was creating value with a resilient network to drive growth. In the fourth quarter, we saw that growth materialize with improved volume, and that volume will bolster our revenue performance in the coming year as we execute our pricing strategy to grow core revenue per unit. Let's look ahead to 2024 on Slide 23. Our market outlook is for modest volume growth. In merchandise markets, overall volume growth is expected to be driven by gains in steel shipments. Automotive will grow on continued strength in vehicle production, including new EV business. Improved fluidity and increased network velocity will lift our effective capacity in both of these markets. Shifting to intermodal, we are optimistic that increasing levels of international trade will boost demand for both our domestic and international services. There's still uncertainty around how quickly capacity in the truck market right-sizes. Additionally, the strength of the consumer could pressure growth if the economy softens. Lastly, our coal outlook is for relatively flat volume levels compared to last year. Demand for export coal is forecasted to be high, but some of this demand will be met via a shift of historically domestic coal to export markets. Utility demand will be driven by stockpile levels, which are forecast to remain elevated in 2024, aside from extreme weather events. Looking at price, we expect strong pricing conditions in our merchandise markets, aided by our improved service product. However, as mentioned, a persistently weak truck market will mute the opportunity for intermodal price, with contract truck rates expected to trend roughly sideways from their current levels throughout 2024. We also faced some headwinds on coal pricing this year related to difficult comparisons for seaborne coal prices, with additional pressure from high stockpiles and weak natural gas prices. All said, we still expect to generate pricing above rail inflation in 2024. When we take all this together, we are reasonably confident that overall market fundamentals will create opportunities for us to bring on new freight and further the volume trend we achieved in the fourth quarter of 2023, while delivering incremental top-line revenue growth through core pricing gains, as we price into the value of our enhanced service product. Finally, let's turn to Slide 24. I'd like to give you some examples of how our customer-centric approach is yielding smart and sustainable growth. Last February, our team met with FedEx Ground with the intent to enhance Norfolk Southern service for their transportation network. We listened to their business forecast and made strategic adjustments that we knew would set us up to better serve this valued customer. We charted a better way forward for both of our organizations. As a result, we were able to significantly increase our volume for FedEx Ground during peak season, and we look forward to continuing that growth into the future. We also landed a new plastic recycling plant in Ohio with our new customer Pure Cycle, which is expected to launch this quarter. This is a great example of the circular loop that is possible within the plastic supply chain and how Norfolk Southern can deliver that resin in a carbon-friendly manner. Finally, 2023 was another successful year for the Norfolk Southern Industrial Development team. We partnered with 62 customers to facilitate the completion of strategic industrial development projects in 2023. Collectively, these projects represent $3.1 billion in customer investment and the creation of more than 4,150 new jobs along Norfolk Southern lines. As we look into 2024, we're encouraged by the continued robust pipeline of customers that are looking to locate facilities along our lines. These successes in 2023 are indicative of the success that we expect in '24 and demonstrates our strategy to deliver a better way forward for our customers, our communities and for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back over to Alan.\nAlan Shaw: We overcame a number of challenges in 2023 and we are moving forward with confidence. Our resolve to deliver on all aspects of our strategy has never been stronger. We restored service and improved safety in a responsible manner to protect our franchise and long-term shareholder value. We ended 2023 with the best intermodal service we've seen in years and with an encouraging 5% increase in intermodal volume. Now, we enter 2024 with a fluid network, which will drive productivity gains and further growth this year. Turning to our outlook. We anticipate roughly 3 points of revenue growth in 2024. This growth, combined with our productivity initiatives, will yield strong accretive incremental margins, with operating income growing in excess of revenues. Net income and EPS growth will be suppressed in 2024 versus 2023, owing to higher interest expense from the highly strategic acquisition of CSR, along with the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program. As for the progression through the year, typical seasonality suggests that second quarter and third quarter should be our strongest in terms of margin performance. Obviously, the first quarter will have some industry-wide impact from widespread cold weather in January, and our first quarter still has year-over-year headwinds from storage fees, fuel revenue and export coal price. In-line with the Investor Day guidance, over the midterm horizon, we anticipate delivering strong incremental margins, presuming a normal freight cycle and mix, and 3 points to 4 points of revenue growth. A combination of volume absorption, productivity initiatives and a commitment to cost control will be key drivers. We aren't going to give you a specific margin target, but it should result in between 100 basis points to 150 basis points of margin improvement annually, on the pathway to narrow the margin gap with peers and deliver industry-competitive margins. You'll start to see progress along those lines in 2024, once we lap some of the revenue compared challenges in the first half. We see a path to outsize gains on the upcycle, leveraging volume growth within existing resources, ample productivity runway, and strong core pricing that can outpace inflation pressures. As we narrow our margin gap over time, the secular growth prospects of our powerful franchise will deliver shareholder value through earnings momentum and free cash flow generation. And with that, let's open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Wetherbee: Yeah, hi. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to think a little bit about the bigger picture here, Alan. You talked about the 100 basis points to 150 basis points of OR opportunity per year over a three-year period. As we kind of think about you guys relative to some of your closer peers, that's about half of the gap that exists today. So, I guess as you think over, is there more opportunity beyond that? It just takes time to get there? Do you think that there is the potential for a structural gap between you and your closest geographic peer? I just want to get a sense of how you think about the opportunity maybe beyond that three years and how it might play out.\nAlan Shaw: Chris, we've committed to industry-competitive margins. And in '23, we overcame a lot. We made a lot of progress on our strategic plan. We enhanced safety, we improved service, we attracted new business, we overcame challenges. As we look into '24, it's really a focus on productivity, and we feel like we're going to be on that pathway of 100 basis points to 150 basis points a year, particularly as we get into the second half of the year and lap some of these revenue comps. But we gave a three-year outlook, but that's not an endpoint. We have talked about continuous productivity improvement as one of the three components of our balanced strategy of safe service, continuous productivity improvement, and smart growth.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Hoexter: Hey, great. Good morning. I guess I'm still surprised by that timeframe, right. Should seem like there's still moves that would get you that leverage a bit quicker, I guess, just compared to some moves we've seen some other rails. So, maybe just was the impetus for some of these changes the headcount, the three-year OR targets? There's been some activist chatter in the market. Is that something that's edging you behind in terms of making some of these changes? And then, I guess ultimately the question is, is pricing accretive to margins in '24? Thanks.\nAlan Shaw: Hey, Ken, with us entering the third year of a freight recession and with the investments that we've made in safety and service that are delivering meaningful results, it's clear that our cost structure is too high for our revenue base entering 2024. And so, we addressed service, we addressed safety, we addressed growth in '23. We did it in a responsible manner to protect our franchise and our shareholders. Now, as we enter 2024, we've got a much more fluid network, much safer network and network that is attracting growth, and it's a focus on productivity. And so, yeah, we're looking at every cost out there. And we're looking at discretionary costs, we're looking at management costs, and we're focused on productivity, because it is a balanced plan. I'll let Ed talk about price.\nEd Elkins: Yeah. We were successful in '23 on price. And in '24, we have a good price plan that's strong and really is going to produce value every quarter of this year. So, we feel good about where we are with price. And there's a couple of things that I'll add to that. We're feeling really good about where we are with our service trajectory at this point. We're hearing from customers that they appreciate the value that we're providing for them, and we're doing it at the facility level, going out and talking to customers, focused on that first and final mile and how we add value, and that's going to produce value for us and for our shareholders all year long.\nKen Hoexter: Thanks. I appreciate it. And I know one question, but I'm just trying to understand, are you saying then we get better margins in '24? Is that pricing outpacing that cost? Sorry, just trying to understand the answer there.\nMark George: That's part of the equation. Yeah, that is part of the equation, for sure.\nKen Hoexter: Thanks, Mark. Thanks, guys.\nAlan Shaw: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. So, Alan, you've been telling us for a little while now that maybe we'll see weaker decrementals at the trough, but then we'll see better incremental on the way back up. I think about Q4, where we started to see the way back up. We saw some pretty good volume growth, and the incremental margins were still really muted even with a nice fuel lag tailwind. So, how do I think about why we didn't see it this quarter? And then, maybe just going-forward, you just said the cost structure is too high. I don't know that I heard that you're telling us that costs come down from here maybe I misheard. Or do cost come down from here? And then, I don't know, just to put it all together, Mark, sometimes you just give us some color on near-term OpEx and margin. How to think about Q1? That would be helpful. Thank you.\nAlan Shaw: Yeah, Scott, we had to overcome a lot in '23, And we made investments in a prudent manner to enhance safety, enhance service and attract growth, particularly in our most service-sensitive markets. And so, we're putting -- with respect we're putting proof points up on the Board. As we move through into the fourth quarter, we were still wrestling with a service product that was off plan, which adds complexity, adds variability and adds cost. We're operating in a really tough freight environment and we were dealing with pretty healthy year-over-year inflation, and we're still lapping some difficult comps with respect to the fuel surcharge revenue and with respect to storage revenue, right?\nMark George: And mix.\nAlan Shaw: And mix. And so, as we move into '24, those things are going to start to unwind themselves, right? We've got a much more fluid network. We're operating on plan. That will drive out our service recovery costs. And then, after that, we're going to continue to iterate to our plan. That's going to help drive productivity, and we're going to attract new business. And as you noted, our strategy is all about outperforming during an upmarket. I don't see that in the next six months. When the economy does recover, it always does, when the freight market does recover and it always does, we're going to be called for growth.\nScott Group: Mark, any color on the OpEx, the OR, Q1, again, just I don't know that I asked -- you said the cost structure is too high. Does it come down or not? I guess I'm not sure what the answer is.\nMark George: So, I think as you go into Q1, you're going to have some of the normal seasonality that has an impact on your OR. So, I think you need to expect that the first half, Q1 in particular, is probably going to step back, but then we feel much better as we lap a lot of the headwinds that we've been talking about from this first half, the intermodal storage charges, some of the fuel price and some of the other RPU challenges we're having on coal price, I think as we get to that back half is where you're going to really start to see much stronger incrementals and drop through.\nScott Group: Okay.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Alan, if we look at the three-year plan, I think if you ask every railroad in North America, they tell you that they also would expect to improve margins by 100 basis points to 150 basis points a year from where we are today. So, I guess the negative implication of that outlook is that you're not actually narrowing the gap, you're just improving your position from where you are, but the gap actually stays intact. So, I'd be curious to get your perspective on that. And I think the cost structure is high, which is you're addressing that by taking these difficult actions with non-salaried workers. And I know that's a really difficult decision. But it seems also like when I look at the cost structure, it seems like the answer to something going wrong is throwing as many resources at that problem as possible. If I look at materials expense or rents expense, and if I talk to any kind of operating intensive railroad, their answer is, you never really drown a problem with resources. That's the opposite of what you should do. So, I'm trying to understand the removal of the non-union or the rationalization of the non-union employees is one step in that direction. But are we having a rethink about how we actually operate the railroad day-in and day-out and how we respond to issues? Because it seems like that's kind of the root cause of the problem in terms of where the gap is today. Sorry for the long-winded question, but just want to get your perspective on that.\nAlan Shaw: What was the first part of your question, Amit?\nAmit Mehrotra: Well, just in terms of the -- yeah, sure, Alan, the three-year outlook, 100 basis points to 150 basis points, every rail on the continent will think that. So, you're not actually narrowing the gap. So that was the question.\nAlan Shaw: Well, that's our commitment. Our commitment is industry-competitive margins and top-tier revenue and earnings growth. And we said we were going to do that through an economic cycle. We said we would have difficulty within industry-competitive margins during a trough and the freight market. And candidly, we didn't expect some of the incidents that occurred in 2023, the network disruptions, the Eastern Ohio incident, and a continuation of a very difficult truck market. We invested throughout 2023 for the long term, and in the long-term best interests of Norfolk Southern and our shareholders. And we improved service. We improved safety. Volumes grew in the fourth quarter. Now, we can really narrow our focus, right? We can narrow our focus into productivity, and that's exactly what we're doing. And we're going to drive that by operating to the plan, a high degree of compliance to the plan, that will shed resources, that's going to shed a lot of the service recovery resources that you just referenced. As we get on plan, we'll continue to iterate the plan and look for additional ways to drive out complexity, drive out costs and improve balance.\nMark George: And just adding to what Alan said, as we think back to the fourth quarter, it was all about driving intermodal service, recognizing that the service sensitivity of that was going to directly drive growth to this railroad, which we did see. The shift in the layering on now is towards driving that discipline and rigor inside of our merchandise network. We recognize that is where our single biggest opportunity is. Total T&E is as a result of that, essentially troughed in October. And we expect that we're going to see greater productivity as we continue to dial-in our merchandise network. That's going to be a reduced number of recrews and all the associated costs, taxis, hotels, deadheading, overtime, car hire, equipment expense. We're going to see improved capacity in our merchandise network as cars per carload improves. So that's the flywheel impact that we're talking about. So, to your question about what is fundamentally changing moving forward, it's from where we are now moving forward, a direct focus on merchandise, recognizing that's our next single biggest lever for productivity.\nAlan Shaw: That's where two-thirds of our operating costs are.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nJon Chappell: Thank you. I hate to keep on the guidance a bit, but I'm going to move up to the revenue line here. I'm just trying to understand the roughly 3%. I get that there's macro headwinds. I understand the first half may be difficult. But by the same token, you have incredibly easy volume comps, given all the disruption from February until August. And Ed talked about the continuation of the pricing above inflation. So, one would probably expect the volumes to be a little bit better than 3%, just given the comparisons. So, are we saying that all in yield may be down this year? Or is there just like a healthy element of conservatism that you're putting into the macroeconomy in the first half of the year that may be tamping that number down?\nEd Elkins: I think there is -- this is Ed, by the way. There is a lot of uncertainty around what's going to happen here in the first half of the year. I think the Street has baked a lot of expectations around Fed actions and we'll see where that goes. But frankly, you look at first quarter and we see pretty sedate volume opportunities here in the first quarter, and the recent weather events for the entire industry has kind of confirmed that. But then, we see a steady progression of volume improvement throughout the year. And I think volume improvement will probably lead the parade, so to speak, in terms of revenue and yield improvement for us. But we're pretty confident we might be conservative around coal price, but that's, I think, the right thing to do for ourselves as well as for the rest of the industry.\nJon Chappell: Okay. Thank you, Ed.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes in line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nTom Wadewitz: Yeah, good morning. I want to ask you one granular one and then kind of a higher level one. So, I guess on the granular question, for Paul, should we think about with a fairly muted volume backdrop that train starts would come down in '24? Or are you thinking kind of, hey, the schedule is set and we'll keep that where it is? And then, the higher-level question, I think when investors look at Norfolk, they say, okay, there is a potential idiosyncratic opportunity to run the system better. Maybe that runs on its own regardless of freight market. But I don't know that that's clear. So, should we look at it as more of a kind of idio improvement story or is this really a freight market, freight cycle leverage story, right, that it is really -- when the freight market improves, if that second half, if that's '25, then you're just really well positioned for that. So, I think just trying to figure out what's really the right way to look at the Norfolk story. Thank you.\nAlan Shaw: Paul, why don't you address the first question? I'll take the second.\nPaul Duncan: Yeah, absolutely, Tom, thanks for the question. So, we think about it not just as train starts, but overall T&E productivity, it's all about getting the most from our crews. And we're going to see that improve through not only what we've seen here over the past several weeks for improvements in network velocity, but running more discipline to plan and layering down initiatives. We know running more discipline to plan is already starting to show itself in reductions in T&E expense. You've seen it in the productivity measures from the slides. We're going to make further iterations to the plan as we get more disciplined, particularly in our merchandise network. And that's only going to drive improvements in GTMs per horsepower, but also on the T&E side. We've got a number of initiatives beyond just running the plan more disciplined and seeing that cost come out again that we're layering on. We've got pool transitions taking place. So, as we have gotten more fluid and more consistent, we have transitioned more short pool runs to long pool runs, again because we've got greater consistency and velocity in the network that has productivity benefits. We have put more towards assigned service from a T&E standpoint. That means we've got assigned crew pools and turns that reduces hotels, van expenses, has a quality-of-life benefit. We are going to roll out predictable work scheduling this year on our conductors -- or with our conductor, excuse me. More than 80% of our schedule -- our network is scheduled, meaning as we layer in predictable work scheduling, we will see a benefit in reductions in displacement time. We've got a number of board consolidation initiatives that are taking place, and we're driving accountabilities to run lean and two plan inside of our merchandise yard. So that all translates into we're going to see train length on the merchandise side. We've got line of sight on some improvements we can make there. Not only through further iterations of the plan, we've also got some investments planned this year in some of our major merch channels that are going to drive productivity and train length. Intermodal train length went up in Q4 as a direct result of us not only delivering great service, but customers rewarding us with business. And again, we're going to continue to work on that. And from a bulk standpoint, you've heard us talk about the various longer-term initiatives we have with our customers to invest in facilities, particularly in our [indiscernible] network. Several elevators are investing, and we expect to really see the benefits as those investments come to play.\nAlan Shaw: And Tom, to your second question, as we've gone through 2023 and we've made the necessary improvements in safety, in service, and attractive growth, we can really start to focus on productivity in our own plan and execution of that plan. That provides benefit as well. And then, our whole strategy is about outperforming during the upcycle. Our franchise is built to outperform during the upcycle. You've seen us recover from network disruptions much faster than we have in the past. So, there's a proof point as well. We're not calling when that upcycle occurs, but when it does, we do believe that we will outperform, and we will attract new business with high incremental margins. So, it's improving our own operations and executability with the plan as we can now narrow our focus on really operating to the plan and driving efficiencies and then participating and outperforming during the upcycle.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just quick follow-up for Paul. If you can just give us some sense in terms of how much of those productivity metrics you're talking about are actually independent of volume? I'm sure that would help. But how much do you have line of sight if volume stays flat or maybe doesn't recover in the back half? And then just to ask more broadly, do you think there's a structural margin gap that will always be here for this network versus some of your peers? You do have roughly 10 percentage points more intermodal. It's more truck competitive. You can have shorter length of haul dynamics with international as well, lighter weight, more touches. So, I'd just be curious to hear if that's something you think about in the long term in terms of closing that gap, that might be a hindrance or if there's something I'm not thinking about from a productivity density perspective, that could make that an incorrect assumption. Thank you.\nAlan Shaw: Brian, each franchise has unique strengths. We have committed to top-tier revenue and top-tier earnings growth, coupled with industry-competitive margins. We're going to deliver that. We've got a franchise that faces the fastest growing segments of the U.S. economy and a franchise that's poised for growth. We're entering the third year of a freight recession. That will unwind. And when it does, the enhancements that we've made to safety, the enhancements that we've made to service, the ability to attract business in the fourth quarter, and automotive and intermodal, which are our most service-sensitive markets, right, give us a pathway to success going forward and allow us to unlock our full potential. And Paul and his team and entire executive team are intently focused on driving out cost inefficiencies and driving productivity.\nMark George: Let me just add real quick. This entire team recognizes that a margin gap exists today between where we are and where we should be, and we're focused intently on closing and narrowing that gap before we get to an area of talking about why any remaining gap exists. There's a lot of runway still for us organically and self help.\nPaul Duncan: Yeah. The specific around how much is initiatives versus volume adjust, many of those initiatives that I spoke to are going to continue regardless of the volume environment. The iterations to the plan are always going to continue, but that is going to be the lever that is most sensitive to volume. But we're going to continue to drive train life. We're going to continue to drive crew productivity regardless of the volume environment.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my question. And I guess maybe the frustration from the investor side is that if we go back a couple of analyst meetings, maybe even back to 2015, the mantra here has always been that we're trying to close the gap. But I guess constructively, Paul or Ed, can you help us understand where you are in trip plan compliance with your customers? Because I think ultimately, it's consistency of service that matters, right? So, what can you talk about what did you learn through changing the make-up rules through 2023? And where is the future on service to your customers? What are you seeing today?\nPaul Duncan: Well, let me start off, and I'd love to have Ed jump in here as well. From an intermodal perspective, as we look at where we finished fourth quarter, we delivered the best intermodal service we have put across this railroad in several years, and customers rewarded us with volume as a result. We expect to maintain that level of service based on what we've heard from our customers is their expectation. From a merchandise standpoint, we continue to see improvements in merchandise trip plan compliance throughout the year. To your point around the train makeup rules, we said that we were going to recover after we had moved forward with those, meant to again drive greater safety and resiliency across our network. We feel very confident that we've seen -- merchandise trip line compliance continue to come up throughout the year, and we feel that we're very confident as we look at 2024 based on the further discipline that we are going to build and drive inside of our merchandise network.\nEd Elkins: I'd offer a couple of proof points just to think about that are recent. The first one is we had one of our very largest customers comment to us that come emerging from the weather events that just happened in the past year -- or, excuse me, in the past week, that we recovered better than just about anybody else. And we really take that to heart because they themselves are a broad survey of many other railroads. So, we think that that's really important as a proof point for resilience. As we return back to plan faster and faster after inevitable events, that's going to define a large part of the value that we're offering customers.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens Inc. Please proceed with your question.\nJustin Long: Thanks, and good morning. So, for 2024, there are a lot of moving pieces that you've talked about. But when you put it all together, do you think you'll be within that targeted longer-term range of 100 basis points to 150 basis points of annual improvement in the OR? And, Mark, I think you and Alan both mentioned the interest expense headwind you'll have this year. I was wondering if you could help quantify that year-over-year headwind.\nMark George: Yeah. Thanks, Justin. Let's be explicit with interest. We ended 2023 with about $17.2 billion of outstanding debt. The effective interest rate is about 4.7%. So, I would model about $210 million a quarter for interest expense on the go forward. We've essentially kind of pre-funded that CSR acquisition, so that should be relatively steady within a couple of few million dollars per quarter of that. And as we look at the moving pieces, again, we've got some headwinds here in the first half. I think as volume starts to grow as we go from Q2 to Q3 and then into Q4, we should really start to see, with the compares, a pretty good improvement year-over-year. So, I don't see so much in the first quarter certainly. I think there's a risk of regression there. But I think as we navigate the second quarter depending on volumes, but in particular in the second half is where you'll see most of the improvement. And, look, I think that 100 basis points and 150 basis points that we're talking about kind of on the go forward, we should definitely be there in the back half. Whether it translates into a full year amount or not, I think depends on a number of other factors.\nJustin Long: Okay. Thanks.\nMark George: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Seidl: Thank you. Good morning, guys. I'll put the bat away for the horse, that is guidance here, and turn the attention a little bit to what you're seeing in terms of impacts from any diversions on the port side, whether they're from geopolitical events or from the Panama Canal. And if you haven't seen them yet, do you expect to see them? And what sort of impact should we look going forward?\nAlan Shaw: Ed, what do you hear from customers?\nEd Elkins: We're talking to our customers a lot about this. It's a situation that has grown over time. We haven't seen any impact yet to our volumes. Fact is, our East Coast port volumes continue to be remarkably strong, and we are hearing customers start to evaluate their West Coast options, and that makes sense, given some rather unprecedented things that are going on. But regardless, the great thing about our network is we're well positioned to pick up that volume growth, whether it comes in the East Coast or the West Coast. And I think we're going to be able to very ably serve our customers and satisfy their needs.\nJason Seidl: Ed, is there a preference on East Coast versus West Coast in the network?\nEd Elkins: Well, I've got all kinds of preferences, but no, we've got the network built to take on volume, whether it comes through the East Coast or the West Coast. I think there's probably more intermodal conversion opportunity when it comes through the West Coast. But we've gotten very good at doing short haul intermodal with our international customers.\nAlan Shaw: Frankly, that's one of the benefits of our franchise, right?\nEd Elkins: Ture.\nAlan Shaw: We've got the most powerful intermodal franchise in the East, which serves 60% of the consumers. So, no matter whether it comes in the East Coast or West Coast, we're going to handle it.\nEd Elkins: That's right.\nJason Seidl: Appreciate the time, as always, gentlemen.\nAlan Shaw: Thank you.\nEd Elkins: Thank you, Jason.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi, good morning. So, with the focus on long-term growth, could you maybe talk to the growth investment embedded in CapEx? Is it higher? Is it lower? And then, with that longer-term margin roadmap, is there an offset embedded in that given just sort of the ongoing investment in service that NS is making? Just any thoughts there. Thanks.\nAlan Shaw: Mark, you want to talk about the capital program, please?\nMark George: Yeah. I mean, the capital guidance actually for '23, I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that was going to be largely flat with 2022. And I would say that the mix within that between reinvesting in the business and safety and resilience, it's about the same as what it was in 2022, call it about 60%, 65%, and the growth element to that is the balance, call it, 35%, and that's pretty consistent between the two years, Allison. Second part of your question again, I don't recall.\nAllison Poliniak: Yeah. Just that longer-term margin roadmap, obviously you're investing in service. Is there sort of an offset embedded in that margin just given this ongoing investment? It certainly doesn't end here. Just trying to think through that.\nAlan Shaw: Well, I know that a faster network is a less expensive network. So, as we invest in service and we invest in resiliency, it translates to fewer recruits, fewer network disruptions, fewer -- less overtime, less equipment rents, improved fuel consumption and fuel efficiency. So yeah, that's the part of our franchise -- or pardon me, of our strategy, right, it's that balance between service, productivity and growth, and they build on each other. Thank you.\nMark George: The velocity piece plays into the growth.\nAlan Shaw: Thank you, Allison.\nAllison Poliniak: Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJordan Alliger: Yeah, hi. Just a couple of clarifications here, make sure I understand. In terms of thinking about this year, in light of the -- you mentioned, steadily increasing volume assumptions and then increasing incrementals, particularly in the second half and the year-over-year improvement in margin, notably in the second half. I guess the question is what needs to happen to do better than to -- the 100 basis points to 150 basis points, the longer-term target? I would imagine part of the plan for the back half of this year is probably to exceed that, I would think. And then, secondarily, can you give a little more color around the use of cash this year? I think you said you're suspending the buyback, but the interest expense is pretty high. So, is debt reduction part of it? Because I think you also mentioned you want to get the liquidity ratios more in line. So, maybe where do you hope to end the year on that front? Thanks.\nMark George: Yeah, Jordan, on the cash side, yeah, we've got the big CSR purchase here in March. We've gone outside of our preferred debt to EBITDA range at the very end of the year, in part because we've had to also fund these Palestine costs. So that will continue to consume some cash as well in 2024, and then we've got the CSR purchase in addition to that. There are no debt redemptions planned this year. So, it's really an issue of operating cash minus CapEx, gets you to free cash flow. And then, in that free cash flow, we've got our CapEx budget, which is flat with last year, as well as the CSR purchase. From there, we don't expect to have remaining cash to do share repurchase. So, as we go into 2025, we should be in a better track with EBITDA growth to start to have a more normal capital allocation cycle like we've experienced in the past.\nJordan Alliger: Thanks. And then just the first part.\nMark George: Yeah. Why don't you repeat the first part?\nJordan Alliger: Yeah. I mean, sure you've mentioned a few times that you expect steadily increasing volumes and steadily increasing incrementals as we move through the year, with the second half seeing the lion's share, I suppose, of the margin improvements. I guess I'm just curious would the plan contemplate in excess of the 100 basis points to 150 basis points in the back half? And what needs to happen to do that? I assume it's volume, but...\nMark George: Yeah. So, Jordan, I think as you look at it, one thing that's going to happen on the cost side is these service costs that I laid out in my chart will come out. They may not come out as great in the first quarter, largely because of what we're doing to mitigate the cold weather, but they're going to come out and they're going to start coming out in the first quarter. And the plan is that most of those will start to release here in the second quarter, if not, it will be completely gone. So that provides us some traction for sure. A lot of the other fluidity and improvements that Paul mentioned will start to really take hold and provide traction, where we actually think our T&E counts may end the year a little bit lower than where they started the year, which means you're taking on more volume and you're actually having perhaps fewer crews, that's embedded productivity right there. And then, of course, we're doing actions on the non-agreement side that will also yield some benefits. So, we feel really good about our back half and our margin profile. I think a little bit stronger revenue, we can absolutely outperform that 150 basis points in the back half -- the 100 basis points to 150 basis points in the back half, and possibly be there for the full year because of it.\nJordan Alliger: Thank you.\nMark George: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Maybe just a high-level question here, maybe going back to some of the previous questions asked and just tying it up. I mean, look, there's obviously a margin gap to your peers and it's kind of easy to point the cost to the reason why. But you guys have been cutting costs for many years and you've taken a lot of resources down and you've done a lot to improve the service product. I think you have the lowest cost per carload of any of your peers. At what point is this not really a cost problem and is more of a revenue problem and that needs the bulk of the resources addressing that rather than trying to take out more cost?\nAlan Shaw: Look, it's a balanced approach, and we overcame a lot of Norfolk Southern specific headwinds in 2023. And we enter 2024 with a safer network, a more fluid network and a network that is attracting business from our most service-sensitive customers. Once we get through this freight recession, and we will, we are poised for outperformance during the upcycle. That is the essence of our strategy. We're doing what we laid out at our Investor Day 14 months ago. And I'm proud of the way that we've overcome these obstacles in 2023 and set the stage for margin improvement in 2024, while protecting the best long-term interest of our shareholders and the Norfolk Southern franchise.\nMark George: Yeah. Make no mistake, Ravi, this franchise, this network is built to handle a lot more volume, but we have a lot of cost runway ahead of us. And that's what we're focused on right now and we're certainly going to welcome the revenue when it comes. And I think again that's going to drive the high incrementals at that point. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Vernon: Hi, thanks guys, and thanks for taking the question. So, Mark, on the topic of cost, I think there were some headlines last night about some headcount actions, non-union workforce. Is there a specific cost program in place with a quantifiable number that we can be thinking about in terms of pursuit of sort of the non-operational costs as we kind of await the flywheel starting to spin?\nMark George: Well, with regard to the non-agreement program, maybe I'm going to assume that's what you're referring to, we had mentioned about 7% was our target and that's kind of deal over 300 people. But I think that the timing will probably start to take effect here in the second quarter, just the way the voluntary program works. So, we'll start to see the cost relief take place here in the second quarter. And frankly, the savings amount will depend upon the mix of the folks that put their names in. So, we certainly internally have a number in mind and we'll see where it settles after that. But we're going to -- aside from that, there are other areas we're going to go after. Again, we're not happy with our purchased service spend. We were in a year of very difficult, challenging situation where we had to quickly get our network up and running again from a number of challenges, be it weather or accidents. So, we've put a lot of money into quickly revamp using some outside services to quickly revamp our network on the mechanical side as well as engineering side. I would hope that those things start to really settle down. That's our focus, Paul and I, as well as even on the technology spend, we've been using a lot more software as a service, cloud-based services, which show up in purchased services as opposed to CapEx. So that's been putting pressure on our purchased services, but we've got to try to again put a lid on that growth. And I will mention that can't discount inflation. Inflation in 2023 was well over 4% in our cost structure. As we go into 2024, I expect to see inflation maybe be half of that impact. So that's going to be another area of tailwind. So, thanks for the question, David.\nDavid Vernon: That's helpful. And maybe just to squeeze one in here on the CSR purchase. Obviously, you're going to be adding depreciation on the rent side. Is there any sort of like net benefit of owning that property versus just renting, or is this just more about avoiding future lease payments?\nMark George: Yeah. Look, I think the biggest issue is these costs could have quickly run away from us upon lease renewal. We did not control what the lease rate was going to be. We knew that, that would go to arbitration and it could be a significant multiple of where we were. So, it's really a benefit when you think about what it could be on the go forward, overall. There is some above-the-line benefits that we have in our depreciation today, that lesson, as well as the rent payment that goes away. But again, the interest burden and a pause on share repurchase provides a temporary hurdle for us. All right, we've got it wrong. We got another question before we wrap up here.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nWalter Spracklin: Yeah. Thanks for squeezing me in here. So, Alan, I just want to understand again, at the end of the day here, you're talking about top-tier volume growth at industry-competitive margins. And when I look at industry-competitive margin, say, consensus estimates for next year, it's in the 60% to 61% range of OR for each of these -- each of your peers. And even if they do nothing and they don't move in their OR at all and I just take the midpoint of your 100 basis points to 150 basis points, I mean that's six years before you can get to industry-competitive margins. So, is that what we're communicating here? Is that the setup? Or we just look -- am I looking at it the wrong way? And maybe you can help me there.\nAlan Shaw: [Bascome] (ph), we've given you a roadmap for the next three years on how we're going to narrow the gap with our peers with respect to margin. Our commitment is industry-competitive margins. We've given you an outline of where we're headed based where we see markets. If there's more lift in the freight market, then I fully expect we're going to outperform, because our investments in safety and service and our ability to attract growth in the fastest-growing markets and the most service-sensitive markets are going to yield outsized benefits to Norfolk Southern and our shareholders during an upcycle But we're not calling that yet.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question this morning comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna International Group. Please proceed with your question.\nBascome Majors: Hey, Mark, you've been candid about the lumpy legal outflows and the insurance inflows on the cash flow front you're going to see from the Eastern Ohio incident and how that's going to be with you for some time here. But as we think about the cost structure, can you talk a little more about the ongoing operating cost increases that came from that and how fully burdened what we saw in the fourth quarter was for that and what may still be ahead? And I'm thinking things like insurance premiums or depreciation or say maintenance or testing contracts, but really anything you can share on the ongoing cost increase and how far along we are in that process would be really helpful. Thank you.\nMark George: So, I'm interpreting the question beyond the East Palestine specific impacts that we reported and kind of the aftereffects of it that are in the operating results. And I'll ask Paul to help, but clearly there were impacts that consequential from East Palestine where we accelerated those train make-up, little changes that certainly had an impact in the second quarter and probably going into the third quarter. I think we've ingested that now, and that's no longer really providing any adverse -- adding adverse impact. We have installed more additional wayside detectors that we're carrying. We're doing more testing. We've got some more people monitoring our wayside deaths, et cetera. I wouldn't say that the incremental direct safety costs that come out of EP are consequential. And frankly, I think ultimately they're going to yield to better results in the go forward, because we are running a safer railroad. We're having a much better derailment experience in terms of less frequency, as a result of some of the operational changes, including the make-up rules have had. So, overall, there's probably some -- for sure, some lingering incremental cost, because we're doing things different, but there will be a benefit longer term. Paul, do you want to add anything?\nPaul Duncan: Yeah, I'll just add to -- thanks, Mark. The proof is in the pudding that we saw a 42% reduction in our mainline accident rate this year. So, as Alan described, part of our strategy has been to safely deliver reliable and resilient service, and 2023 was a challenging year for us, but those are the types of things that are going to move the needle in driving towards \"We have a safer, more resilient product on the railroad.\" So yes, there are going to be some of those costs as Mark just outlined very well that remain embedded, with the offset being, we're going to see and deliver a safer product for our customers and through the communities we serve.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Shaw for final comments.\nAlan Shaw: Thank you for joining us today.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'm going to turn the call over to your host, Tony Rossi with Financial Profiles. Please go ahead.\nTony Rossi: Thank you, Valerie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for First Western Financial\u2019s fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. Joining us from First Western's management team are Scott Wylie, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Julie Courkamp, Chief Operating Officer; and David Weber, Chief Financial Officer. We will use a slide presentation as part of our discussion this morning. If you have not done so already, please visit the events and presentations page of First Western's Investor Relations website to download a copy of the presentation. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements with respect to the future performance and financial condition of First Western Financial that involve risks and uncertainties. Various factors could cause actual results to be materially different for many future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These factors are discussed in the company's SEC filings, which are available on the company's website. I would also direct you to read the disclaimers in our earnings release and investor presentation. The company disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the call. Additionally, management may refer to non-GAAP measures, which are intended to supplement but not substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The press release, available on the website, contains the financial and other quantitative information to be discussed today, as well as the reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Scott.\nScott Wylie: Thanks, Tony. And good morning, everybody. As we enter our 20th year in business and our sixth as a public company, we believe we're well positioned for solid revenue and earnings gains in spite of the environmental challenges of 2023. During the fourth quarter, we continued to execute on our strategic priorities, which included maintaining disciplined expense control, while focusing on new deposit relationships in order to increase our liquidity and put us in a better position to fund new loan production once loan demand increases as economic conditions improve. With our increased focus on deposit gathering, we had an 18% annualized growth in total deposits with increases in both non-interest bearing and interest bearing deposits and further lowered our loan to deposit ratio to achieve our year-end target of 100% as we remain conservative in new loan production, which kept our total loans relatively flat during the quarter. As part of this effort, we made the strategic decision to add some short-term higher cost deposits. While this had a near-term impact on our net interest margin, we believed it was in the best interest -- best long-term interest is, it enables us to have the funding to add new client relationships that we believe we can expand over time and be highly profitable for the company. Given the short-term nature of the deposits, we'll be able to replace them with lower cost funding sources as market conditions normalize and interest rates decrease. Our provision for credit loss has increased largely due to reserve on individually analyzed loans we established for the relationship that we put on non-accrual in the prior quarter. This provision resulted in a lower level of net interest income for the quarter, but we still had $4.1 million in pre-tax, pre-provision net income. As we're going through the workout process for the relationships in non-performing status, we've received updated appraisals on the properties we have as collateral, which have all remained consistent with previous valuations, and in some cases have increased. However, in a couple cases, we also have as collateral receivables and business valuations that we now believe might not be fully collectible. So we established a reserve on individually analyzed loans to reflect the possibility that we may not fully collect on those receivables. Consistent with what we said last quarter, we expect it will take a few quarters for these loans to be resolved and with the sale of multiple properties we have as collateral, all being on different timelines. The experience we have consistently through the history of First Western is that, the strong underwriting criteria and collateral we have is ultimately resulted in minimal or no losses on these loans. As I indicated earlier, we continue to execute on our key strategic priorities, one of which was disciplined expense control. At the beginning of 2023, we indicated we expected noninterest expense to be in the range of $20 million to $21 million per quarter in 2023. We finished the year with non-interest expense well below this level at just over 18 million. This reflects our focus on improving efficiencies throughout the organization and reducing costs without impacting our business development capabilities or the level of service that we provide to our clients. We're continuing to look at all areas for opportunities to operate more efficiently, which not only reduces expenses, but also offsets our investment in other areas, such as our technology platform that we believe will help enhance the long-term value of our franchise. Moving to Slide 4, We generated net income of $0.3 million or $0.03 per diluted share in the fourth quarter. We also saw a small decline in our tangible book value per share during the quarter, which was due to an unfavorable shift in AOCI, resulting from a cash flow hedge on certain FHLB borrowings that decreased in value as the interest rates declined. Nevertheless, our tangible book value has increased 143% since our pre-IPO levels of June 2018, as shown in the layer slide. Now I'll turn the call over to Julie for some additional discussion of our balance sheet and trust and investment management trends. Julie?\nJulie Courkamp: Thank you, Scott. Turning to Slide 5, we'll look at the trends in our loan portfolio. Our total loans increased $12 million from the end of the prior quarter. The increase is driven by growth in our residential mortgage and CRE portfolios, which was partially offset by small declines in our other portfolios. We continue to be conservative and highly selective our new loan production, focusing primarily on clients that also bring a full relationship, inclusive of deposits and investment management to the bank. This resulted in new loan production being about half of what it was in the prior quarter, which, as Scott mentioned earlier, helped us to bring our loan to deposit ratio in line with our year-end target of 100% and much closer to our historic target of 90% to 95%, which is a key near-term objective for the company. And with the discipline we are maintaining in our pricing criteria, the average rate on new production increased 35 basis points from the prior quarter to 8.27% and was 8.43% in the month of December. Moving to Slide 6, we'll take a closer look at our deposit trends. Our total deposits increased by $109 million during the quarter with increases in both non-interest bearing and interest bearing deposits. We continue to have success in new business development and added 118 million in new deposit relationships during the fourth quarter. Non-interest bearing deposits increased $6.3 million during the fourth quarter, reversing the trend of clients moving money out of non-interest bearing accounts into interest bearing accounts in order to get a higher yield on their excess liquidity. And as Scott mentioned earlier, we made a strategic decision to add some short-term higher-cost deposits, which also contributed to the deposit growth in the quarter, but will be replaced with lower-cost funding as market conditions normalize and interest rates decrease. Turning to trust and investment management on Slide 7. We had a $357 million increase in our assets under management in the fourth quarter, primarily due to market performance. We also had a $303 million in inflows from new and existing clients during the quarter. However, this was offset by account closures and withdrawals. The $646 million increase in AUM year-over-year was achieved in spite of a 10% fee increase we began implementing mid-year. Now, I'll turn the call over to David for further discussion of our financial results. David?\nDavid Weber: Thank you, Julie. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 8, we'll look at our gross revenue. Our gross revenue declined 2.7% from the prior quarter, primarily due to an increase in deposit costs that reduced our net interest income. This was the smallest decline that we have seen over these past five quarters as the environmental headwinds have abated. Turning to Slide 9, we'll look at the trends in our net interest income and margin. Our net interest income decreased 2.6% due to a decline in our net interest margin. Our net interest margin decreased 9 basis points to 2.37%, driven by an increase in interest-bearing deposit costs, offset partially by an increase in yields on average earning assets. As Scott indicated, we made a strategic decision to add some short-term higher-cost deposits to increase our near-term liquidity, which negatively impacted NIM in the fourth quarter. As market conditions normalize and interest rates decline, we will replace these deposits with lower-cost funding that will be beneficial to our NIM. Now turning to Slide 10, our non-interest income remained flat compared to the prior quarter. Net gain on mortgage loans was slightly lower, which reflects both the seasonal impact of lower mortgage demand in the fourth quarter, as well as the higher rate environment. We had a slight decline in trust and investment management fees compared to the prior quarter. However, fees increased 8% year-over-year. These declines were partially offset by an increase in risk management and insurance fees, which are seasonally higher in the fourth quarter each year. Now turning to Slide 11 and our expenses. Our noninterest expense was relatively consistent with the prior quarter, as we continue to focus on disciplined expense control. A decline in our salaries and benefits expense in the fourth quarter, partially driven by the one-time acquisition-related compensation expense that was recognized in the prior quarter was offset by small increases in most other line items. It is a challenging environment to forecast in. However, if we generate mid-teens revenue growth in 2024, we expect our non-interest expense to range from $19.5 million to $20.5 million per quarter. If we generate single-digit revenue growth in 2024, we expect our non-interest expense to range from $18.5 million to $19.5 million per quarter. Now turning to Slide 12, we'll look at our asset quality. On a broad basis, the loan portfolio continues to perform well as we had another quarter of minimal losses. This continues our 10-year history of near 0% credit losses. We had a slight increase in non-performing loans, which was attributable to two credits placed on non-performing status in the quarter. We recorded a provision for credit losses of $3.9 million, which related to the reserve on individually analyzed loans that Scott discussed earlier, as well as reserves established for the two new credits that were placed on non-performing status. The provision recorded this quarter, combined with the modest level of loan growth, increased our level of allowance to adjusted loans by 18 basis points to 1.1% at December 31st. Now, I'll turn it back to Scott. Scott?\nScott Wylie: Thanks, David. Turning to Slide 13, we provided an update on our strong track record of value creation for shareholders. This slide shows our trend in tangible book value per share since our IPO in 2018 and the factors that have contributed to our consistent ability to drive growth in tangible book value per share as we've executed well on the plan that we communicated at the time of our IPO. Following our fourth quarter performance, we've increased our tangible book value per share by 143% since our IPO, which includes the 56% decrease we had due to the adoption of CISL at the beginning of 2023. And the fourth quarter included a negative impact due to the unfavorable shift in AOCI resulting from the cash flow hedge on certain FHLB borrowings we mentioned earlier. We're very proud of this track record of value creation and believe that we're well positioned to continue creating additional value for our shareholders in the future. Turning to Slide 14, I'll wrap up with some comments about our outlook and priorities for 2024. There remains a high degree of uncertainty regarding the economic conditions we'll see in 2024, but we believe we're well positioned to perform well in any economic scenario that emerges this year. A strong balance sheet and conservative underwriting criteria should enable us to effectively manage through an economic downturn as we have throughout our history. I'd like to reemphasize a point I made earlier. While we may see an increase in problem loans and non-accrual loans in economic downturn, historically this has not resulted in a meaningful level of loss due to the strong collateral we require in our underwriting. And we would also expect to continue to have a level of net charge-offs that's well below the level experienced by the broader banking industry in a material economic downturn or recession. Should the Fed manage to keep us out of a recession and affect a soft landing for the economy, our business development capabilities and unique value proposition will enable us to take advantage of strengthening economic conditions and an increase in loan demand. At this point, with economic conditions remaining uncertain at the start of the year, we'll continue to prioritize prudent risk management and conservative underwriting criteria, which should result in a modest level of near-term loan growth. But we have the ability to be nimble and quickly respond to changing market conditions. And should economic conditions improve and loan demand increase, we would expect to see a higher level of loan growth at that point. As we look to our markets, we believe the competitive environment has become more favorable for us as many banks have had to pull back from loan production due to capital constraints, funding challenges, and/or credit concerns. We're able to maintain our disciplined pricing criteria and still add new relationships with fewer banks being as aggressive in pricing and structure in order to win business as we've seen in recent quarters. As we've indicated, deposit gathering is going to remain a top priority with an increased focus on targeting deposit rich industries like nonprofits and homeowner associations. We have a good deal of expertise in both of those areas throughout the company that we're now leveraging to a greater extent to add new clients that are good sources of low-cost deposits. Most importantly, our focus will remain on our core business and our core clients. These type of clients provide good opportunities to expand relationships over time as they typically want and need the various products and services that we provide and they typically result in very low levels of credit losses. This is what we built our franchise on and there are -- still lots of room to grow by focusing on these types of clients. While 2024 will be a difficult year to forecast, we do see a number of catalysts that should contribute to earnings growth this year. Our core revenue sources of loan yields, deposit costs, fees, [indiscernible] fees and mortgages have survived the strains of 2023 and seem likely to have upside in 2024. We have good momentum in business development that should lead to continued growth in our client roster and balance sheet. We have a liability-sensitive balance sheet and a good deal of deposits indexed to Fed funds. So when we see expansion in our -- we should see expansion in our net income -- net interest margin as market conditions normalize and interest rates decline. We'll also continue to be disciplined in our expense management, while we continue to get the benefit from leveraging past investments in technology, talent, and office expansion. In the past year or so, we've also made many process improvements throughout the organization that should lead to enhanced efficiencies as we continue to add scale. We believe these catalysts should result in a higher level of earnings this year, even with a modest level of balance sheet growth. And as always, we'll continue to operate the company with a long-term perspective. The strength of the franchise and the balance sheet we've already built, we believe we can continue to capitalize on the attractive markets that we operate in to consistently add new clients, realize more operating leverage as we increase scale, generate profitable growth, and further enhance the value of our franchise. In the future, as we grow earnings and create value for shareholders, the improved currency we'll have from higher stock price will enable us to execute on additional M&A transactions that we believe will enhance shareholder value just as our past transactions have done. With that, we're happy to take your questions. So, Valerie, go ahead and open up the call, please.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brett Rabatin of Hovde Group. Your line is open.\nBrett Rabatin: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nScott Wylie: Good morning, Brett.\nBrett Rabatin: I wanted Just to start off on credit and you talked a little bit about the $3.9 million that you added this quarter. Can you talk a little bit about kind of what led to those moving to non-accrual and just anything you're seeing in any particular industries?\nScott Wylie: Are you asking about the credit or are you asking about the credit trends across the platform?\nBrett Rabatin: I'm just asking about those two loans that I think are $3.9 million, just what led to those\u2026\nScott Wylie: Okay. Yes, sure. So one was a relatively small commercial loan, and the other was a construction loan that has substantial equity in it. And recent valuation collateral showed it was well in excess of the loan. Both of those were downgraded for very specific reasons related to the borrowers. They aren't indicative of broader trends that we're seeing in the portfolio. This is reflective of what we've seen throughout our history, which is, sometimes loans go into non-performing status and they rarely result in a meaningful level of loss due to our underwriting standards and our strong collateral and the multiple sources of repayment that we require.\nBrett Rabatin: Okay. And then on the four loans that you moved to non-accrual last quarter that are related for $42 million. How much of the $3.9 million provision was specifically related to those? And then any color on how much of that relationship, I know, there's a commercial loan -- a commercial -- owner-occupied commercial estate loan, a residential mortgage, and I think a personal line of credit, how much would be not covered by real estate?\nScott Wylie: I think a starting point on that has to be that, that relationship is currently the subject of ongoing litigation, which is out in the public realm through the courts. And because of that, we shouldn't provide any additional detail. I think, specifically on the question of the reserve this quarter we put up, it was substantially related to that relationship. And we think that the provision that we recorded is prudent and conservative based on everything we know as of now. We do continue to believe we have adequate collateral, and I mentioned that we've been working on updated appraisals, and all the appraisals have held up, including some that have increased significantly in a couple of cases.\nBrett Rabatin: Okay. Yes, a little litigation, that's somewhat unusual. And then maybe just for clarity on the margin and kind of the pace from here, you referenced that you use some shorter term funding sources this quarter. Can you maybe talk about just how you see the margin progressing in 2024? And then just if the Fed's cutting 2025, 100 basis points, what rate cuts would mean to the margin, as you see it?\nScott Wylie: Yes, let me take a stab at that, David, and then if you want to jump in and provide more -- if you want more, just ask. But, as I look at NIM as a starting point and look for, kind of trend and a bottoming out, I would tell you our last three months were apples to apples, 2.50% October, 2.35% November, 2.26% December. We were anticipating 2.33% for January and that seems to be about where we are. 2.35% in February and 2.43% in February and March are kind of our internal forecasts. Again, who knows, as we talked about several times in our comments. Overall, the bank is liability sensitive. We historically have tried to operate with a balanced -- balance sheet from an [indiscernible] perspective, but right now we are significantly liability sensitive. And so, our estimate in sort of unprecedented conditions that we're in today is a 25 basis point decline, would produce something like a $1 million annualized earnings improvement, revenue and earnings improvement. So those would be kind of the two data points I would point to from what we think we know today. [indiscernible] David.\nDavid Weber: Yes, that's totally fair.\nScott Wylie: Give a good start.\nDavid Weber: Yes.\nBrett Rabatin: [Multiple Speakers] Okay. Yes, that's really helpful. I've got other questions, but I'll hop back into the queue. Thanks so much.\nScott Wylie: Yes, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Brady Gailey of KBW. Your line is open.\nBrady Gailey: Thanks. Good morning, guys.\nScott Wylie: Good morning, Brady.\nBrady Gailey: One more just on the reserve build. I mean, taking the reserve up 18 basis points in a quarter is pretty notable. It sounds like that's driven by a specific reserve on this credit where litigation is involved, is that correct?\nScott Wylie: That is correct.\nBrady Gailey: Okay. And I know you don't want to talk much about it, just the facts on it, how big is that loan and what type of loan is that? Where the litigation is involved?\nScott Wylie: The relationship, which includes a number of loans, is a total of $53 million and we participated out $11 million of that. So on our books, it's $42 million.\nBrady Gailey: Okay. And the composition of those loans is what?\nScott Wylie: The composition of the loans?\nBrady Gailey: Yes, the several loans that make up the $42 million that's on balance here, are those C&I, CRE.\nScott Wylie: They're commercial loans that are secured with all that real estate collateral that we've talked about in the past.\nBrady Gailey: Okay. All right. And then, Scott, I heard you say that you're expecting a modest level of long growth this year. I mean, should we interpret that as low single digit or could it be better than that?\nScott Wylie: Let me check my crystal ball here. I think that for us, we don't think 2023, we're hoping 2024 is not another 2023. So we have historically found lots of opportunities to grow our types of loans with our types of clients across our 19 offices. And I think that will be the future for us. I'm not sure if that plays out entirely in 2024. One of the things we were thinking about in 2023 are -- we had a 114 basis point loan deposit ratio in October of 2022. And it's just really hard to grow loans when you're not sure where your deposit growth is going to come from to support that. And so, a lot of our thinking in 2023 was, let's grow loan -- deposits, I mean, back to -- get our loan-to-deposit ratio down where we have historically ran it, which is kind of 90% to 95%. And I think what we've talked about on these calls is, we would like to get that down to 100% by year-end 2023, which we did. So I think we were in a little bit of a chicken and egg problem in 2023, where we were saying we're not really going to grow loans if we don't have the deposits to support it in-house. And so, let's focus on getting deposits in-house. The other side of that, though, in the past, I've seen -- if you kind of shut off the loans they get, it's hard to turn it back on. So we tried to be mindful of that with our relationship bankers and support loan requests for loans that do fit well into our credit approach and our strategy and our type of client and whatnot. So a long way around of saying we're planning on kind of mid-single-digit loan growth in 2024, because we don't know. And for us, that drives a guesstimate of mid-teen revenue growth. And if we can do what David was saying in terms of managing our operating expenses, which is, if we grow mid-teen revenue growth, then maybe $20 million or so in operating expenses per quarter. If we did mid-single-digit revenue growth, maybe $19 million in the quarter in operating expense. I mean, that's kind of how we're thinking about it, Brady, and I know that's not a very satisfying answer, but that's, I think, the best you can do, given the environment we're in.\nBrady Gailey: I understand it. That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Butler of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nAdam Butler: Hi. Good morning, everybody. This is Adam on for Matthew Clark. If I could just touch on the deposit side first. You guys had nice deposit growth during the quarter and looks like the majority of it was based on time deposit growth. I was just curious if you could touch on the nature of that growth and the maturity of those deposits and what you put them on at?\nScott Wylie: Yes. Adam, just before we address that, there's one more point I'd like to make about Brady's question, which I think was obvious, but in case it wasn't, I would just follow through and make the point. I think that the more important measure for me of all those things I said is what is the run rate EPS and what's happening there. And I think our core EPS run rate would improve significantly with those conditions I described, a 15%-ish revenue growth and the expense growth we talked about, and gets us by the end of the year into an earnings position well above where we were in 2022 and 2023 on a run rate basis. So I just think that's an important conclusion, Brady, of what you specifically asked about. So sorry to take a detour there, Adam. But let's go to your question about deposits in -- I think the increase that we put on in deposits in the fourth quarter, some of them were noninterest-bearing. We actually grew DDAs, I think, for the first time in a year. So that felt good. Of the CDs, I think we added about $49 million in three month deposits, $45 million in six month deposits and $7 million in nine month deposits during Q4. So those would roll over appropriately going to roll off over the course of the year and give us the opportunity to reprice those. As we talked about, either because rates are falling or because markets are normalizing, and we talked about that several times in our comments, because historically, we have been able to grow kind of core deposits with clients pretty effectively. For example, as we've tripled the balance sheet since our IPO. And I just think that 2023 was this abnormal environment that I don't think it's going to continue forever. It may continue some into 2024, but I don't think it's going to continue forever. So, I do expect we'll have the opportunity to refinance those higher cost deposits as they roll off in 2024.\nAdam Butler: Okay. I appreciate the color there. And I failed to mention the increase in noninterest bearing, but I was getting there. It was nice to see that too. And I was just going to -- just looking at overall deposit flows. I was -- given your guide for potentially mid-single-digit loan growth, are you thinking kind of the same in deposit growth and keeping that loan-to-deposit near the 100% range? Or has that guidance changed on your end? Thanks.\nScott Wylie: No. I think we would like to see it trend over time back to our historic numbers in the low to mid-90s. I think that's where we feel comfortable. I would tell you another data point that helps the argument or hope that we bottomed out on NIM is our spot rate for deposits at 3.31% was -- December 31, I mean, was 3.31%. So we're seeing that increase moderate as we go through the fourth quarter.\nAdam Butler: Yes. That\u2019s great to see. Those are my questions. I appreciate the time. Thanks.\nScott Wylie: Good. Yes, thank you, Adam.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Dezellem of Tieton Capital Management. Your line is open.\nBill Dezellem: Is that Bill Dezellem?\nOperator: Yes, your line is open.\nBill Dezellem: Thank you. So two questions. First of all, relative to a comment that you made in the press release, are you seeing an increase in loan demand now where -- there was a press release simply trying to relay that you are ready when that does happen.\nScott Wylie: Yes. I'm not sure, Bill. I think our loan demand definitely came down from our type of borrowers when rates spiked. And I think people have come back some. And so in that sense, it's probably improved. Our pipelines at the end of Q4 are actually down from the end of Q3, but I think some of that is this kind of pressure we put on relationship bankers to focus on deposits over straight up loans. I also think that we saw, let's say, a year ago and probably six months ago, banks doing kind of unreasonable loan terms and rates. And I would say we see a lot less of that now. Although in January, we have heard a couple of anecdotes about kind of pricing that we would never do. And I assume that some of these banks that are looking to grow in our markets that are assuming that we're going to see big Fed rate cuts and rates come down and that their lower loan price is going to make sense. But there's a number of dynamics in place there. My underlying conclusion from all that is we have tiny market share in all of our markets, and we're in a lot of really attractive growth markets. And so, I think to the extent we want to grow loans, we're going to be able to grow loans. And I think some number in the mid-single digits seems very achievable to me for this year.\nBill Dezellem: Okay. That's helpful. And you may have just answered my follow-up question to that is, as you think about running the bank and that you probably have seen your loan pipeline decrease really because of a directive or initiatives that you've had in place to focus on deposits, does that lead you to change anything in terms of the direction that you're asking bankers to go? Or are you still in the same holding pattern that maybe you would have been last quarter?\nScott Wylie: No. I felt like we were in a little bit of a chicken and egg problem in Q3, where we're telling our bankers to focus on relationships to bring deposits and loans but don't lead with loans. And frankly, a lot of times, the relationships you want, you do lead with loans and you bring deposits with it. And so, by getting our loan to deposit ratio down to 100%, I feel like that frees us up out of the chicken and egg problem, and we can go out and focus on the kind of relationships that we want. I would tell you also, though, I feel like this second half of the year 2023, gave us an opportunity to really talk to our people about our type of client and focusing on those kind of people that we can really do a range of services for. I mean, I was in a new business call last week, where we met with this couple that had a business and they're just going to benefit from all the different things we do. And if you look at our top 10 clients in any office, it's the same story in every one of them, where they have six or eight or 10 products with us. And so, I think just really helping our people focus on our type of client, with our types of credits and our types of relationships that include deposits, loans, treasury management, risk management, planning, trust, investment management, succession planning, all that kind of stuff, and that's what we're really good at. And that's, I think, where we've had the opportunity to refocus people. And I think that will benefit us in 2024. I think that will be a good thing for us.\nBill Dezellem: Great. Thank you, Scott. And then I'm going to ask one question relative to the large borrower that went bad last -- in the Q3. You mentioned that you put provision in place on some of those loans. So my question is, if you were to have more success, say, if you took a loan over and sold it at a premium, that would also apply to offset these other loans that you may come in a bit under. Is that correct? Or is there -- and I guess, secondarily, is there any cross reciprocity between the loans as collateral that comes into play that could make your reserving or provisioning conservative that way?\nScott Wylie: Yes. With the litigation, I want to be really careful what we say here. But if the question is, are the loans cross-collateralized, the answer to that is yes.\nBill Dezellem: Great. I\u2019ll leave it at that and keep it easy for you. Thank you.\nScott Wylie: Yes. Thank you, Bill.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Brett Rabatin of Hovde Group. Your line is open.\nBrett Rabatin: Hi. Just a couple of follow-ups. I guess, first, did I hear it correct on the expenses, if you have mid-teen revenue growth, the guidance is $19.5 million to $20.5 million, and if it's single digit then it's $18.5 million to $19.5 million on a quarterly pace, was that -- were those the right numbers?\nScott Wylie: Correct, yes.\nBrett Rabatin: Okay. And does that kind of mean that the difference would be kind of the bonus or incentive comp that folks would get for hitting certain targets? Or what -- can you talk maybe a little bit more about that differentiation?\nScott Wylie: The vast majority of it is incentive comp accrual related, yes.\nBrett Rabatin: Okay. And then, Scott, as I think about mortgage, obviously, it's tough to know what rates do, but it feels like people are getting more used to higher mortgage rates. And so I was just thinking about the mortgage production from here and potential revenue in 2024. I know it's tough to predict, but I would assume that we'd see a meaningful pickup in activity and income related to that as we get into the second quarter. Is that fair? Or do you see kind of the challenges remaining for production and overall revenue for that piece of the business?\nScott Wylie: Well, we come in every morning and hope for an uptick, and it's hard, of course, in December and January, which are slow months, but -- you want to address that, Julie?\nJulie Courkamp: Yes. I would kind of say we're hoping for an uptick. We're planning for an uptick, but it will continue to be challenging regardless. There is -- in addition to the rate environment, just the supply is still kind of low in our core markets as well. We're working very hard to find new production avenues. So new MLOs. We've been adding those over the course of the last couple of quarters, have some good ones in the pipeline. That's another way we're looking at -- the major way we're looking at increasing our production. But I think we foresee it to be a bit of a challenge for the next several months and then I\u2019m hoping for seasonality coming into the spring and summer months, as well as rate environment improvement and consumer sentiments, frankly, changing a little bit to give us a little bit of a base into the summer and fall months.\nScott Wylie: We're seeing house prices flat to coming down in our higher end markets, and we're seeing the time on market extend. So all that stuff sounds like late cycle recovery potential, and then we see rates come down. And of course, mortgage rates are generally tied more to the bond values that we've seen over the last six months and Fed funds. So you could imagine a better year this year for mortgages than what we saw last year, which was pretty hideous.\nJulie Courkamp: And then I would tell you, we continue to rationalize expenses in that area as much as possible and share resources and do the things that we can do to keep managing expenses as well.\nScott Wylie: We've loaned some of the people out to other areas that sort of thing, but I'm trying to cut our production capability.\nBrett Rabatin: Okay. And maybe just one last one. In your prepared commentary, Scott, you talked about M&A. And I guess I was a little surprised just kind of given where the stock is, it would seem like that'd be -- it'd be tougher. I kind of thought you might talk more about maybe share repurchases than M&A, but any additional color around M&A and just are you having discussions with folks -- what do you think is the outlook for you guys from an M&A perspective? I know you've been acquisitive in the past.\nScott Wylie: Yes. So what works well for us is courtships that lead to partnerships. And so, the fact that our stock is at 80% or so of tangible book value, I mean, we don't believe that makes sense, and that's not really where it's going to be. It was at $33 year and a half ago. So I do think if we can show -- demonstrate some of the things we've been talking about on this call today, that there is some upside there. And then as the courtships are proceeding, that would give us the currency that we would want to do an M&A. But we're not -- we're always looking and we're opportunistic. We're working on relationships, but we're going to be conservative and disciplined. Your comment is absolutely right. We're not going to do anything with our stock at $18, I don't think -- and or $17 where it is now. And it doesn't mean we shouldn't keep working on it.\nBrett Rabatin: Okay. Fair enough. Appreciate all the color. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Scott Wylie for any closing remarks.\nScott Wylie: Yes. Well, thank you again, Valerie. I'd just like to wrap up with some overall comments from our conversation today. Our focus on client relationships got us through 2023 with positive earnings, with deposit growth, loan growth, increased tangible book value per share in spite of the CECL negative impact on tangible book value. We reduced our operating expenses. We reduced our loan-to-deposit ratio from a peak of 114% down to -- in 2022, down to just over 100% at year-end. Our NIM appears to have bottomed out. Our AUM showed some nice growth. Our capital ratio has improved. Our increased NPLs should work out in 2024 as we continued our 40-quarter streak of essentially 0% charge-offs last year. With 2023 behind us and entering our 20th year in 2024 here, we opened the doors March 17th of 2004. We're cautiously optimistic about our ability to grow revenues and therefore, earnings nicely in 2024 and beyond. We feel that relatively modest asset growth with improved margins and improved fees can once again deliver the kind of strong operating leverage that we've seen since our 2018 IPO. I really appreciate everybody taking the time to dial in and speak with us this morning. We sure appreciate the support for First Western. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor. For more information see our T&C."

During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions and instructions to follow at that time. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Barry Ray, Chief Financial Officer of MidWestOne Financial Group.\nBarry Ray: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We appreciate your participation in our earnings conference call this morning. With me here on the call are Chip Reeves, our Chief Executive Officer; Len Devaisher, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Gary Sims, our Chief Credit Officer. Following the conclusion of today's conference, a replay of this call will be available on our website. Additionally, a slide deck to complement today's presentation is also available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Before we begin, let me remind everyone on the call that this presentation contains forward-looking statements relating to the financial condition, results of operations and business of MidWestOne Financial Group, Inc. Forward-looking statements generally include words such as believes, expects, anticipates and other similar expressions. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated. Among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are interest rates, changes in the mix of the company's business, competitive pressures, general economic conditions and the risk factors detailed in the company's periodic reports and registration statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. MidWestOne Financial Group, Inc. undertakes no obligation to publicly revise or update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this presentation. I would now like to turn the call over to Chip.\nCharles Reeves: Thank you, Barry, and good morning. On today's call, I'll provide a high-level overview of our fourth quarter results and an update on the significant progress that we've achieved executing our strategic plan over the last year. Len will then provide an update on our lines of business, and Barry will conclude with a more detailed review of our fourth quarter financial results. Starting on slide three of our earnings presentation, we delivered net income of $2.7 million or earnings per diluted share of $0.17. During the quarter, we sold $115 million of securities, resulting in a net pre-tax loss of $5.7 million as we continue to address our liability-sensitive balance sheet. We also recorded $438,000 in costs related to our previously announced voluntary early retirement program, $245,000 of merger-related costs and $105,000 reduction to the fair value of our MSR. Adjusting for those four items, adjusted net income was $7.7 million or $0.49 per diluted common share. Now looking deeper at our results, I'm pleased with our balance sheet trends. We delivered 6.1% annualized loan growth for the fourth quarter and 7.5% loan growth for the full year as we continue to benefit from the expansion of our major market banking teams. Additionally, we achieved a modest core deposit growth in the fourth quarter and remain cautiously optimistic we can continue to grow our core deposit franchise through the year ahead. While our balance sheet trends are encouraging, we do remain liability sensitive and the interest rate environment continued to pressure our NIM and NII through the fourth quarter. That said, we have continued to see a moderation in the rate of our NIM decline and expect our margin will trough through the first half of 2024. Importantly, we continue to control what we can control and execute quite well on our strategic initiatives to transform MidWestOne Bank and position this institution to deliver financial results at the median of our peer group by the end of 2025. As I've said on previous calls, we're working hard to become a top-performing bank and believe we are firmly on track given the substantial progress we've achieved over this past year. A key accomplishment was the realignment of our geographic footprint announced in September with the sale of our Florida operations and the proceeds to be reinvested in a highly attractive Denver MSA through our merger with Denver Bankshares, the long-established $272 million asset bank. During the fourth quarter, in that mark, we hired an SBA officer and a treasury management officer, as we continue to further expand our platform and accelerate growth in this large commercially robust MSA. Looking forward, we've received all regulatory approvals and expect the merger to close on January 31st. At closing, we'll have approximately $640 million in loans and $400 million in deposits in the Denver marketplace and firmly believe we're on the path to building this MSA into a $1 billion plus franchise in the coming years. We also continue to expand and up-tier our commercial banking and wealth management businesses and have enjoyed robust loan and assets under management growth in our major metro markets of the Twin Cities, Denver and Metro Iowa. Our plan is to continue to add bankers as we target middle-market companies with $20 million to $150 million in revenue and individuals with investable assets of $3 million to $20 million. Importantly, we're excited about the hiring of our new Head of Wealth Management, a seasoned leader with extensive super regional experience in the Midwest. We look to achieve double-digit annual revenue growth in this business segment in the years to come. Additionally, we added two experienced commercial bankers in our Metro Iowa markets, one in Des Moines and one in Dubuque. Overall, we've made significant progress growing our product and talent capabilities in both our core markets and our specialty verticals of Agribusiness and SBA. Accordingly, we expect an acceleration in loan growth to the high single digits for the full year 2024. We're also extremely pleased with our 2023 expense discipline. As part of this, we outlined a plan to reduce our operating expense base by 5% and then reallocate 2.5% into more productive, profitable markets and partners. Through 2023, we've exceeded that stated plan and remain focused on the appropriate balance of cost containment and growth reinvestment. To conclude, we've made substantial progress transforming MidWestOne and positioning the bank for improved earnings power and returns for when the interest rate cycle abates. While our liability-sensitive balance sheet has challenged current earnings, the execution of our strategic initiatives is progressing better and faster than what we've expected and I remain very optimistic on what the future holds for our employees and shareholders. At this time, I'd also like to thank our employees for their continued hard work, combined with our commitment to our company, customers and communities. This journey would not be possible without their unwavering support. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Len.\nLen Devaisher: Thanks, Chip, and good day, everyone. Deposits have remained a consistent focus in 2023, and the results are showing. We're especially pleased at the improving quality of the segment mix with consumer and commercial deposits, muting a decline in high-cost lumpy public funds. Our positive net new deposit accounts in 2023 and strong growth in services per household, which are up from 3.40% to 3.48% reflect our focus on a proactive relationship approach. Looking forward, we remain cautiously optimistic, having generated another quarter of core deposit growth, as highlighted on slide six. Our commercial banking team continues to drive strong growth on the asset side of the balance sheet too. Our $50 million of commercial loan growth in the fourth quarter was driven by our focused markets, particularly Iowa Metro. We continue to see growth in CRE and ag balances. And in terms of new commitments, we see strong momentum in C&I. Our long story is about growth but also profitability and risk. We are pleased that our weighted average coupon of new commercial originations in December was up to 7.76%, an increase from 7.27% in September. Our renewal rate averaged 8.37% in December, up from 8.26% in September. As outlined on slide eight, our nonperforming assets ratio is stable. During the fourth quarter, we did see three relationships migrate from special mention to classified. Two in the senior living space and one in the office CRE space. Importantly, we saw only a de minimis amount of credit exposure migrate from past to special mention. The credit risk profile of our portfolio remains solid with low net charge-offs of only nine basis points for the full year and the leading indicator of 30-plus day delinquency at a low 26 basis points. Our portfolio remains well reserved with an allowance for credit losses of 1.25%. As slide nine shows, we are well positioned with a diversified loan portfolio without outsized concentration in CRE and only 3.8% in non-owner-occupied office. Turning to slide 10, the talent investments in wealth also continue to bear fruit. Year-to-date, the team has been entrusted with new assets of $195 million, which represents a nearly 60% increase compared to 2022. As Chip mentioned, we see an opportunity to further grow our wealth business and are excited to have named a new head of our wealth business this past week. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to our CFO, Barry Ray, to discuss our financial results.\nBarry Ray: Thank you, Len. I'll walk through our financial statements beginning with the balance sheet on slide 12. Starting with assets, loans increased $61 million or 6.1% annualized from the linked quarter to $4.13 billion. Strength in the fourth quarter was led by commercial real estate loans, which increased $49.3 million or 9.3% annualized from the linked quarter. The overall portfolio yield was 5.34%, a 15 basis point improvement from the linked quarter. During the quarter, the allowance for credit losses decreased $100,000 to $51.5 million or 1.25% of loans held for investment at December 31st. The small decrease reflected loan growth in portfolio segments with expected credit loss rates that are lower than other segments. Turning to deposits. Excluding brokered, deposits increased $31.4 million or 0.6% from the linked quarter. This is the second sequential quarter of deposit growth, which points positively to continued growth in the year ahead as our deposit franchise stabilizes. For the fourth quarter, total deposits increased $32.3 million to $5.4 billion at December 31st as compared to September 30th. This increase, combined with our security sales, positioned us to reduce higher cost FHLB borrowings. During the quarter, total borrowed funds decreased $74.9 million to $423.6 million. As Chip touched on, the rising interest rate environment continued to pressure deposit costs and our total funding costs in the fourth quarter. Specifically, the cost of interest-bearing liabilities rose 32 basis points to 2.65% comprised of increases to our interest-bearing deposits, short-term borrowing and long-term debt costs. Finishing the balance sheet, total shareholders' equity increased $19 million to $524.4 million driven primarily by a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Turning to the income statement on slide 15, net interest income declined $2 million in the fourth quarter to $32.6 million as compared to the linked quarter, due primarily to higher funding costs partially offset by lower volumes of interest-bearing liabilities, higher volumes of interest-earning assets and higher interest-earning asset yields. Our tax equivalent net interest margin declined 13 basis points to 2.22% in the fourth quarter as compared to 2.35% in the linked quarter. Our net interest margin in the fourth quarter continued to be impacted by the increase in our funding costs which significantly outpaced the increase of 12 basis points in our total interest-earning asset yields. Noninterest income in the fourth quarter decreased $6 million, primarily due to the $5.7 million net loss on our security sale in the fourth quarter and $554,000 unfavorable change in loan revenue. As Chip touched on, we sold $115.2 million of securities in the quarter, resulting in $6.7 million in losses, partially offset by a $1 million gain on the sale of Visa (NYSE:V) Class B shares. The decrease in loan revenue was due primarily to a $388,000 quarter-over-quarter change in the fair value of our MSR and $108,000 quarter-over-quarter change in revenue from mortgage originations. Excluding the loss on security sales and the change in MSR, our noninterest income was stable as compared to the linked quarter. Finishing with expenses, total noninterest expense in the fourth quarter was $32.1 million, an increase of $587,000 or 1.9% from the linked quarter. As we discussed on last quarter's call, we expect that our noninterest expense to gradually rise as we continue to invest in our business. Importantly, and as Chip alluded to earlier, we exceeded our expense savings target in 2023 and as a result, our go-forward annual expense base will be at least $3.25 million lower than had we not undertaken those cost savings measures. Expense control remains a key focus of our management team, and we are very pleased with our execution. And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator to open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Terry McEvoy with Stephens. Please go ahead, Terry.\nTerry McEvoy: Hi. Thanks. Good morning.\nCharles Reeves: Hi, Terry.\nBarry Ray: Good morning.\nTerry McEvoy: Barry, maybe just stick with that expense outlook and commentary that you finished with success in the cost plan, but investing in the future. So how do you think about 2024 when you balance both of those? And what type of an expense outlook do you have?\nBarry Ray: Yes. A couple of things, Terry. Just as a reminder, in the first quarter, we'll have two months of the Bank of Denver coming on as well as we -- Florida will not roll off until the -- really the end of the second quarter. So if I look at it from where we were in the fourth quarter of 2023, we'll be hiring in the first and second quarters. I expect we're going to -- I expect we would come out of that towards the end of 2024 in the $33 million to $35 million range per quarter.\nTerry McEvoy: Perfect. Thank you. And then a question on the margin, how much of the fourth quarter balance sheet restructuring was in the net interest margin in the fourth quarter? And is there an incremental benefit in the first quarter? And then maybe just sticking with the margin, when the Fed hopefully begins to cut rates, given your liability balance sheet, can you get ahead of that? And how quickly do you think you'll see lower deposit rates?\nBarry Ray: Yes. On the first part of that question, Terry, the fourth quarter, we executed the balance sheet repositioning at the very end of the fourth quarter. So there's nothing in the fourth quarter margin, no benefit from that transaction in the fourth quarter margin. So that will be a 2024 tailwind, if you will, to the tune of about a couple of million dollars, I would say, of net interest income. The second piece with respect to should the FOMC start to lower rate and how effective can we be given our liability-sensitive balance sheet, certainly. What we're talking about internally here is how do we get in front of and be prepared for if and when those rate cuts do come. It will really be a function of obviously what's happening in the markets we serve competitive-wise. I do think there's still a lot of competition for deposits. And so I think that will drive how successful we can be at lowering our deposit costs if and when those rates come.\nTerry McEvoy: And maybe if I could sneak one more in for Chip, there has been a lot of hires in a lot of key markets. What areas of the bank are you still looking to add talent? And where is the team complete, so to speak?\nCharles Reeves: I'd say our focus areas continue to be hiring within Commercial Banking and Wealth Management, Terry. I don't think we'll be done there almost ever. They are concentrated primarily in our metro markets as we continue to build out those. Len Devaisher is here as well. Len any further comment?\nLen Devaisher: No, I would agree with that. I would say fundamentally, Chip, in his remarks talked about Denver and our vision for Denver, and I would put that one close to the top of my list as I think about wealth hires there. And with our new wealth leader, I feel encouraged about our ability to bring on new talent and continue to grow that platform.\nTerry McEvoy: Yes. The $1 billion objective or goal did make my notes here and catch my eyes. So well, thanks for taking my questions and have a nice weekend.\nCharles Reeves: Thank you.\nBarry Ray: Thank you to you as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Damon DelMonte with KBW. Please go ahead, Damon.\nDamon DelMonte: Hey, good morning, guys. I hope everybody's doing well today.\nCharles Reeves: Damon, good morning.\nDamon DelMonte: Just wanted to start off with from, good morning, Chip. On the loan outlook, I think you said the mid to high-digits or high single-digits throughout the course of the year. I guess I think the commentary was that you had good growth this quarter on ag and CRE and your gaining increased optimism on C&I. Do you expect that growth to be kind of more balanced as you go through 2024? Or is there one area of the portfolio that you feel is going to outperform the others?\nLen Devaisher: Yes. Damon, this is Len. Good morning and thanks for the question. So I would say --\nDamon DelMonte: Good morning, Len.\nLen Devaisher: Actually, good morning, I feel like we have a good balanced outlook. Actually, what I'm pretty fired up about is I see the C&I momentum going. I also see some strong things happening in our new agribusiness vertical. So as a nice complement to where we've continued to we've enjoyed historically, as you know, a lot of CRE momentum. So that's -- we're seeing the other pieces come into play now so I feel good about that. I would also say that even though as you look at a balanced number from a C&I perspective in the fourth quarter, we did have one customer, we had a significant payoff with the sale of a business but we replaced those balances with new nameplates bringing over and including some nice full relationships. So those things give me a lot of positive outlook as I look forward in '24.\nDamon DelMonte: God it. Okay. And then with respect to the margin, Barry, can you give us a little guidance as to what the expected impact is going to be from Denver when they hit later this month?\nBarry Ray: Yes. I think we'll get some incremental benefit in the margin from the Bank of Denver. Their net interest margin is higher than our net interest margin even though they're relatively small part of our balance sheet, obviously. And then we'll also get the benefit of the accretion from the interest rate marks as well. So I expect there will be some incremental lift in the margin just from that transaction moderated by just the size of the organization.\nDamon DelMonte: Okay. And then did you say that with respect to the core margin, you could see a couple of million dollars of tailwinds from the restructuring on NII here in the first quarter?\nBarry Ray: No, not in the first quarter, in the first year, Damon. 2024.\nDamon DelMonte: The first year. Got it. Okay. And then so when you look at just the core margin, you feel like it bottoms here by like the end of the second quarter?\nBarry Ray: That's kind of how we think about it, Damon, that perhaps the core margin troughs in the middle of 2024 -- first half of 2024.\nDamon DelMonte: Great. Okay, that's all that I had. Thank you.\nBarry Ray: Thanks, Damon.\nCharles Reeves: Thanks, Damon.\nOperator: We have no further questions. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Brian Martin with Janney. Please go ahead, Brian.\nBrian Martin: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nCharles Reeves: Good morning.\nBarry Ray: Good morning, Brian.\nBrian Martin: Hey, just wanted to -- a couple more on the margin, Barry. I guess the margin for the month of December, can you give us an idea of where that was trending? And then just on just the restructuring and the basis point impact of that restructuring. Did you give that maybe, I guess, can you put that, can you frame that up where that's at if you think about where the December margin was since it wasn't really in there?\nBarry Ray: Yes. Our net interest margin in December was 2.15%, Brian. Now that had some negative adjustments in net interest income associated with it. And so probably closer to our really kind of between closer to 220 perhaps. I did not put the basis points on the benefit from the bond sale transaction. But again, it's around $2 million of interest income for 2024.\nBrian Martin: Okay. And that will be in the just throughout the whole year. So, okay, perfect. And then I guess, just secondly, as far as the outlook for credit. And I guess, can you just talk about -- you talked about the special mention being de minimis this quarter is pretty negative, very low. Can you talk about where are the concerns? I know you talked about a couple of the credits that were downgraded in the assisted living front, but just kind of areas you're watching a little bit more closely in terms of risk as you're kind of staying in a certain time period here?\nCharles Reeves: Sure, Brian. This is Chip. And Gary Sims, our Chief Credit Officer, is here in the room with us, and we'll have him go ahead and walk through that for you.\nGary Sims: Hi, Brian, Gary here. Good morning. And as you noted, the migration from special mention to substandard, three relationships, two of them were in senior living, one was an office credit. And when we think about the question of where we focusing on potential risk in our portfolio, that really kind of crystallizes where we're focusing our efforts in identifying risk we have seen softness in the senior living and the office CRE. On the senior living side, for the most part, it's not about occupancy. It's about the operating statement and operating expenses, more specifically nursing care. And then on office, it is, in fact, about occupancy for the most part. So I'll stop, Brian. Did that answer your question?\nBrian Martin: Yes. No, that's helpful. Just need a little more color. Any specific areas that are more concerned, I guess, as you kind of look forward other than what you've kind of already identified or just sectors within the commercial real estate bucket?\nGary Sims: Sure. And good place to state there. As we said, one of the things we were encouraged with as we finished out the year, we didn't see continued migration into the non-pass categories as we finished out the fourth quarter. That kind of gives us a picture that the portfolio, we've identified the risk in the portfolio and it's not continuing to migrate. So we're encouraged by that trend as well. Beyond office and senior living, we're not seeing significant or material weaknesses in other categories at this point, Brian.\nBrian Martin: Okay. All right. That makes sense with the slowdown. So thank you, Gary, for that. And then maybe, I don't know, just Chip, if you said this I joined the call a bit late, but your outlook for all the hiring and the initiatives that you guys have put in place on the fee income side, can you frame up or just talk a little bit about your outlook on fee income this year? Or maybe just kind of the cadence of given what you've done, the groundwork you've laid, kind of how we think about the trajectory of fee income this year to kind of benefit from some of your actions?\nCharles Reeves: We feel that -- so I'd say on the noninterest income side, we feel really good in terms of a couple of areas there, primarily, I'd say, led by wealth management and we divide that business line into two different sectors. One, our investment services, which is really more of our brokerage area and then our assets under management within our wealth department. Our wealth group is growing nicely, assets under management coming into that area increased by about 60% on a year-over-year basis and primarily centered in a couple of our metro markets. In that segment, it was up about 10% from a noninterest income standpoint for the year of '23. We believe and Len mentioned and noted that we just hired a new Head of Wealth Management as well that we believe will continue to maintain and hopefully accelerate some of that revenue drive. Also very comfortable with the build that we've had in our government/SBA group and we're expecting more volume there from a gain on sale in 2024 as well as our customer hedging or swap program showed a nice trajectory increase in '23 and we believe that, that will continue in '24. So overall, we're feeling pretty good about that noninterest income line. The other that we're investing a heck of a lot in and Len and his team have done an outstanding job in building out our treasury management offering and department both from a talent standpoint, but also a product and then also a structural standpoint. And so we're looking for more there as well in '24.\nBrian Martin: And if you kind of frame up kind of the -- if the run rate today is in the $9.5 million, $10 million level, if you kind of look a year out, can you kind of give some guidepost around where you think you could get that to? Given maybe it's going to happen as you say, kind of throughout the year and just kind of building it. But if you kind of look out a year, kind of where you exit '24 in terms of kind of run rate on fees as you move forward.\nCharles Reeves: Yes. No. Ultimately, I think we can move this in the high single-digit to potentially double-digit levels as we exit 2024.\nBrian Martin: Got you. Okay. Perfect. That's helpful, That's really all I had. So I appreciate you guys taking all the questions. Thank you.\nCharles Reeves: Great. Thanks, Brian.\nBarry Ray: Thanks, Brian.\nOperator: We have no further questions. I'll turn the call back to the management team for any closing remarks.\nCharles Reeves: Thank you for everyone joining the call here today. Thank you to our team members for all of their work in 2023, a year of transformation for this organization and we look forward to what 2024 and beyond brings to this institution. Thank you, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. This concludes our call and you may now disconnect your lines.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor. For more information see our T&C."

        "article_content": " \n\nBy Brendan Pierson\n(Reuters) -Bayer was ordered on Friday to pay $2.25 billion to a Pennsylvania man who said he developed cancer from exposure to the company's Roundup weedkiller, the man's attorneys said.\nA jury in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas found that John McKivision's non-Hodgkins lymphoma was the result of using Roundup for yard work at his house for a period of several years. The verdict includes $250 million in compensatory damages and $2 billion in punitive damages.\n\"The jury's punitive damages award sends a clear message that this multi-national corporation needs top to bottom change,\" Tom Kline and Jason Itkin, McKivision's attorneys, said in a joint statement.\nBayer (OTC:BAYRY) in a statement said it disagreed \"with the jury's adverse verdict that conflicts with the overwhelming weight of scientific evidence and worldwide regulatory and scientific assessments, and believe that we have strong arguments on appeal to get this verdict overturned and the unconstitutionally excessive damage award eliminated or reduced.\"\nBayer added that some previous damages awards had been reduced by more than 90 percent.\nThe verdict comes after five other recent wins late last year by plaintiffs suing Bayer over Roundup, though the company won the most recent such trial in December, as well as a string of earlier trials. In all, it has won 10 of the last 16 Roundup trials.\nAround 165,000 claims have been made in the U.S. against the company for personal injuries allegedly caused by Roundup, which Bayer acquired as part of its $63 billion purchase of U.S. agrochemical company  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) in 2018. Most plaintiffs, like McKivision, allege that the product caused them to develop non-Hodgkins lymphoma.\nBayer has said that decades of studies have shown Roundup and its active ingredient, glyphosate, are safe for human use.\nRoundup is among the most widely used weedkillers in the United States, though the company phased out its sales for home use last year.\nIn 2020, Bayer settled most of the then-pending Roundup cases for up to $9.6 billion but failed to get a settlement covering future cases. More than 50,000 claims remain pending.\nLast year's string of losses produced verdicts against the company totaling more than $2 billion. Bayer is appealing those verdicts, which include large punitive damages awards that are likely to be reduced because they exceed U.S. Supreme Court guidance.\nThe losses had led some investors to question Bayer's legal strategy in defending the Roundup cases. The company said in November that it would continue fighting the cases in court and had \"no appetite to write humongous checks\" to settle them.\n\nThe company had even considered a plan to break off its crop science business, in part due to concerns about Roundup liability, though it said earlier this month that it was putting those plans aside for now and focusing on internal reorganization.\nMore Roundup trials are expected later this year.\n \n"

In the 12 months through December, the PCE price index increased 2.6%, matching November's unrevised gain.\nStill, pending U.S. home sales shot up in December by the most since June 2020, indicating prospective buyers may be getting drawn from the sidelines by stabilizing mortgage rates.\n\"Broadly this week we got a nice support for the soft landing scenario,\" said Mona Mahajan, principal and senior investment strategist, Edward Jones, New York citing Friday's inflation reading, Thursday's strong GDP data and improving manufacturing and services data earlier in the week.\nBut Mahajan detected jitters ahead of the Fed's meeting, ending on Jan. 31, as the central bank will likely \"acknowledge the better inflation and economic data but may still push back on the markets pricing of six rate cuts this year\".\n\"Investors are in wait and see mode,\" she said, adding that regarding inflation, the Fed \"will probably not yet declare mission accomplished\". \nThe MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 nations, gained 0.08%, after earlier hitting its highest level in almost two years. For the week it was showing a 1.3% gain. \nWall Street indexes were a mixed bag with the S&P 500 snapping a 5-session streak of record closing highs, falling 3.19 points, or 0.07%, to 4,890.97 on the day. \nFor the week the benchmark index added 1% while the Nasdaq added 0.9% and the Dow industrials advanced 7%, with all three clocking their third weekly gain in a row and their 12th weekly gain out of the last 13 weeks. \nFor Friday's session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 60.30 points, or 0.16%, to 38,109.43, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 55.13 points, or 0.36%, to 15,455.36. \nEurope's equity index earlier closed up 1.1%, marking a 3% gain for the week, which was its biggest weekly percentage advance since the week starting Oct. 30.\nThis was after the European Central Bank (ECB) signaled on Thursday that it could cut rates by April. While ECB chief Christine Lagarde said it was \"premature\" to discuss easing, money markets priced an almost 85% chance of a first quarter point rate cut in April. [GVD/EUR] \nIn currencies, the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of currencies of other major trading partners, was down 0.04% . \nThe dollar rose 0.3% against the yen to 148.09 but the euro was up 0.1% on the day at $1.0855, having lost 1.64% in a month.\nIn Treasuries, the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes rose to 4.1412% compared with its U.S. close of 4.132% on Thursday. The two-year yield, which rises with traders' expectations of higher Fed fund rates, touched 4.3571% compared with a U.S. close of 4.314%. \nIn commodities, oil prices settled higher as positive U.S. economic growth and signs of Chinese stimulus boosted demand sentiment, while Middle East supply concerns added support.\nU.S. crude settled up 0.84% at $78.01 a barrel, their highest settlement level since Nov. 29. Brent crude finished at $83.55 per barrel up 1.36% on the day for their highest closing level since Nov. 30.\nIn precious metals, spot gold prices fell 0.06% to $2,018.58 an ounce as investors' attention shifted to the Fed's policy meeting next week as they waited for insights into the interest rate outlook. \nEarlier in Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares excluding Japan closed down on the day but snapped a three-week losing streak for a 1.6% weekly rise. \n\nChina's CSI blue-chip index dipped on Friday but scored a near 2% weekly gain after three weeks of losses. \nInvestors poured almost $12 billion into Chinese equity funds in the week to Wednesday, a BofA Global Research report calculated on Friday.

Semiconductor makers that make chips for the heavy data needs for generative AI were among the biggest winners in the stock market in 2023. \nThe forecast from Intel, one of the largest suppliers of PC chips, weighed on the rest of the sector. The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index slipped 2.7% to its worst day in more than three weeks. \n\"AI seems like (it is) everywhere except at Intel,\" said Hans Mosesmann, analyst at Rosenblatt Securities, which has a sell rating on the stock.\nThe lack of any perceivable AI growth vector that moves any dial \"points to another, yes another, transitional year,\" he added. \nShares of other chipmakers Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) fell between 1.3% and 2.8%. \nIntel shed about $24.9 billion in market value, based on Friday's closing price of $43.65. Its shares had soared 90% in 2023. \nThe chipmaker forecast current-quarter revenue that could fall short of market estimates by more than $2 billion. \n\"There's a danger Intel is being left behind as chips from the likes of Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices play an increasingly important role in the data-hungry AI industry,\" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. \nWhile Intel isn't yet competitive in the AI-specific chip market, its central processing units (CPUs) are often used in conjunction with Nvidia's AI chips, with a third of Intel's server CPUs now sold as part of AI systems. \nSome analysts had positive comments on the stock, with at least 15 brokerages raising price targets. The median price among brokerages is $44, per LSEG data.\n\n\"The company still stands to win from its AI bet in the long run. Margins appear solid, meaning that CEO Pat Gelsinger's plan will still be put in motion, albeit at a slower pace,\" said Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com.\nIntel's stock trades at about 28 times its 12-month forward earnings estimates, versus 45.08 for AMD and nearly 30 for Nvidia, according to LSEG data.\n \n"

        "article_content": "By Carolina Mandl and Nell Mackenzie\nNEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - A handful of hedge funds made a winning bet on approval of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) by investing in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) well ahead of regulatory sign off, according to sources familiar with the matter.\nHedge funds bought shares in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) between 2021 and 2023 betting its price would skyrocket once the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave the spot bitcoin ETF its green light, the sources said.\nGrayscale had been unsuccessfully trying to convert its trust into an ETF since 2016 and filed a lawsuit against the SEC in 2022 after the regulator rejected its new application. \nGrayscale Bitcoin Trust was converted from a trust to an ETF on Jan. 11 after the SEC approved U.S.-listed ETFs tracking bitcoin. \nAwaiting regulator approval, Grayscale's trust was trading at a discount to its underlying assets that reached almost 50% in December 2022, according to data platform YCharts, following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.\nFor some hedge funds, the potential gains that the ETF approval could generate turned into a trade. As soon as a court decided in favor of Grayscale in August 2023, the price gap began to close, the data show.\nA market maker said roughly 20 hedge funds, from small to big firms, did this trade. This source spoke on condition of anonymity because this person is not allowed to discuss clients' positions publicly.\nGrayscale and the SEC did not respond to a Reuters request for comments on the matter. \nHedge fund Fir Tree Partners, with $3 billion in assets under management, first saw an opportunity in the last quarter of 2022, when Grayscale's trust was trading at a 42% discount to its assets, a person familiar with the matter said. Its bet on the price dislocation narrowing totaled $60 million.\nThe firm, which declined to comment, started to exit the position in September last year, after the court decision. Fir Tree fully sold it in January, following the regulatory approval of the product, according to the source.\nHedge fund Hunting Hill also invested in GBTC when it was trading at a 42% discount and closed it when it narrowed to 7% last year, a source familiar with the matter said. \nThe founder of a U.S.-based macro hedge fund told Reuters his conviction on the approval increased after a court ruling said in August last year the SEC was wrong to reject Grayscale's application. He described it as \"the trade of a century.\" \nNot all the money in the GBTC bet, however, is returning to the bitcoin space. Many hedge funds are among the investors driving outflows in GBTC after its conversion into ETF. Outflows total $4.77 billion since its launch earlier this month, bringing the ETF's assets to $20.4 billion.\nFor many portfolio managers, the price arbitrage was opportunistic.\n\n\"It worked out to be a very good trade,\" said Christopher Brown, founder of the multi-strategy hedge fund Aristides Capital, based in Louisville, Kentucky. The $240 million firm invested roughly $20 million in GBTC with an average discount of 30% to its assets.\nThe fund has sold most of its positions and plans to fully exit in the coming months, as Brown is not interested in investing in the spot bitcoin ETF. \"We're not inherently super excited about bitcoin.\" \n\n \n"

        "article_content": " \n\nBy Saeed Azhar\nNEW YORK (Reuters) -Bank of America's bonus pool for investment bankers will range from steady to 3% lower for 2023 under pressure from a slowdown in dealmaking, but star performers will get higher payouts, according to a source familiar with the matter.\nThe company's traders can expect flat or modestly higher bonuses, except for standouts in mortgages and credit, who will receive high single-digit percentage increases over 2022, the source said.\nThe bank began informing investment bankers and traders about their 2023 bonuses on Friday, the source said. Discretionary compensation at Wall Street banks is highly variable and based on performance. \nThe second largest U.S. lender will also give stock awards to rank-and-file employees who earn $500,000 or less, or about 97% of its workforce, according to a memo seen by Reuters on Thursday.\nBank of America declined to comment.\nThe company posted record full-year sales and trading revenue of $17.4 billion, including zero days of trading losses in 2023.\nIt also reported a pickup in dealmaking in the fourth quarter, which pushed investment banking fees 7% higher to $1.1 billion.\nWall Street giants face a challenging environment beset by subdued dealmaking, economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions. While major banks have laid off thousands of employees, they are also focused on retaining top talent to capitalize on any resurgence in economic activity. \n\"Variability in bonuses between stars and everyone else, and particularly bottom performers, will be more of the norm this year,\" said Natalie Machicao, director of the global banking practice at executive search firm Sheffield Haworth.\n\"It's expensive to replace stars, particularly when the market inevitably comes back later this year, and banks want to retain the people who make a difference generally.\"\n\nGoldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer Denis Coleman told a conference last month that compensation expenses will rise by a low-to-mid single-digit percentage this year. \nGoldman bosses are considering fatter bonuses to retain star traders and dealmakers this year as the bank looks to win over some who were disappointed by smaller payments in 2022, Reuters reported in November, citing five sources with knowledge of the situation.\n \n"

The lawsuit, authorized by the court in 2022, represents more than 100 people who were alleged to have been sexually assaulted by 88 priests and staff working at the Quebec diocese starting in 1940. \n\nIt also names Marc Ouellet, a former Vatican cardinal from Canada who stepped down from his position last year. Last December, Ouellet, 79, said he was suing a woman who accused him of sexual assault more than a decade ago when he was the archbishop of Quebec. \nThe suit includes the names of priests who served in the diocese and at educational institutions, including the Quebec seminary.

        "article_content": " \n\nBy Martin Coulter, Foo Yun Chee and Supantha Mukherjee\nLONDON (Reuters) -Apple faces strong action if changes to its App Store do not meet incoming European Union regulations, the bloc's industry chief said on Friday. \nIn a move designed to comply with the EU's incoming Digital Markets Act (DMA), the company will soon allow software developers to distribute their apps to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) devices via alternative stores. \nFrom early March, developers will be able to offer alternative app stores on iPhones and opt out of using Apple's in-app payment system, which charges commissions of up to 30%.\nHowever, critics have said the changes do not go far enough, arguing Apple's fee structure remains unfair, and that the changes may be in violation of the DMA. \nAsked about Apple's plans, EU industry chief Thierry Breton exclusively told Reuters: \"The DMA will open the gates of the internet to competition so that digital markets are fair and open. Change is already happening. As from 7 March we will assess companies' proposals, with the feedback of third parties.\" \nHe added: \"If the proposed solutions are not good enough, we will not hesitate to take strong action.\" \nUnder Apple's new EU regime, developers will still have to submit apps to Apple for review for cybersecurity risks and obvious fraud. \nApple device users in the EU will also be able to choose their default web browsers and contactless payments apps, meaning they could make contactless payments without using the Apple Pay system.\nBut even if developers opt not to use Apple's App Store or payment system, they will still be required to pay a \"core technology fee\" of 50 euro cents per user account per year.\nApple said on Friday the core technology fee only applies to developers who choose to opt into the new business terms.\nUnder the new business terms for EU apps, Apple estimates that 99 percent of developers would reduce or maintain the fees they owe to Apple, the company said. \nWith millions of free users, companies such as Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) are likely to get hit more than smaller developers. Neither company was immediately available for comment.\nHIGH PRICE\nApple's critics have warned the trade-offs under Apple's new rules offer few benefits.\nAndy Yen, founder and CEO of privacy-focused software firm Proton, said: \"Allowing alternative payments and marketplaces seems positive on the surface, but the strings attached to Apple's new policies mean that in practice it will be impossible for developers to benefit from them.\" \nPaulo Trezentos, CEO of alternative app store Aptoide, said: \"We heard rumours some changes were coming, but we didn't expect them to be this thorough. \n\"This was definitely a good move, but the fees are still too high. We are preparing to send formal feedback to the European Commission.\"\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nA spokesperson for the European Commission said: \"We take note of Apple's announcements ahead of the compliance deadline on 7 March. We do not comment on these announcements. \n\"We strongly encourage designated gatekeepers to test their proposals with third parties.\" \n \n"

        "article_content": "By Joanna Plucinska\nLONDON (Reuters) -Global regulators, aviation security specialists and manufacturers failed to reach an agreement on a quick technical fix to the problem of GPS spoofing near war zones at meeting on Thursday, instead calling for better training of pilots to deal with the issue, according to two sources briefed on the talks.\nAirlines have been urging quick action after a series of incidents where navigation systems were disrupted to show a false location or wrong time, though aircraft flight controls remained intact. \nSpoofing might involve one country's military sending false Global Positioning System (GPS) signals to an enemy plane or drone to hinder its ability to function, which has a collateral effect on nearby airliners. \nGPS jamming and spoofing have grown worse in Eastern Europe, the Black Sea and the Middle East, according to industry group OpsGroup. \nGPS is a growing part of aviation infrastructure as it replaces traditional radio beams used to guide planes towards landing. \nThe first international meeting bringing together the sector was held on Thursday in Cologne, Germany, organized by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and international trade group the International Air Transport Association (IATA).\nGPS interference \"can pose significant challenges to aviation safety,\" and requires that airlines increase data-sharing on jamming and spoofing events, EASA and IATA said in a joint statement. \n\"We need coordinated collection and sharing of GNSS (global navigation satellite system) safety data; universal procedural GNSS incident guidance from aircraft manufacturers; a commitment from states to retain traditional navigation systems as backup in cases where GNSS are spoofed or jammed,\" IATA Director General Willie Walsh.\nMore pilot training could help find an overarching solution to the problem, which experts say is set to worsen with increased global conflict, but it will take longer to approve and standardize any technology.\nThe sector needs to keep some of the older technology in place as an alternative to worsening GPS challenges, officials said at the meeting, according to the sources. \nWhile technical solutions are also an option, they can be expensive, complicated and not always effective depending on what kind of spoofing is used. \nAs GPS interference attacks become more sophisticated, technical solutions would have to be consistently updated, creating a game of cat-and-mouse, one of the sources said. \nA long-term solution also discussed was developing a second layer of authentication that would help check whether a GPS location is being spoofed. \nThis technology has been developed under Europe's Galileo program, the sources said, but is not yet in broad use. \n\nOne of the sources said regulators indicated it was unlikely that any change would be made in the pace of certification for certain technologies, which can take a decade to approve in civil aviation.\nThe next meeting focused on the issue will be a conference on navigation systems held in Antalya, Turkey, in early February organized by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), they said. \n \n"

The gap between September and October is currently the largest for any two consecutive months of the VIX curve.\nThough the vote is still many months away, some on Wall Street have already started gaming out how markets might be impacted by the election, which is increasingly looking to be a rematch between Republican challenger Donald Trump and President Joe Biden, a Democrat. \nJoe Tigay, portfolio manager for Rational Equity Armor Fund, said the \"sizeable\" gap could be reflecting expectations for election-based volatility as well as seasonal gyrations. While the futures expire in mid-October, they encompass S&P 500 options contracts that extend until the middle of the following month, making them sensitive to bets on market moves around the Nov. 5 vote. \nThe VIX historically tends to be elevated in October, with the so-called fear gauge logging an average monthly reading of 21.8, the highest of any month. It currently stands at 13.29.\nIn U.S. politics, October is known for late-cycle news events - dubbed 'October surprises' - that have in the past shaken up presidential campaigns, though their effects on markets have been varied. \nRecent ones include the October 2016 release of a 2005 tape where Donald Trump made lewd comments about women and news that same month that the FBI was investigating more emails as part of a probe into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email system that same month.\nWith about 3,200 contracts traded, volume in the fledgling contracts has so far outstripped newly-issued contracts for other months. \n\nFor instance, the August and September futures drew trading volume of less than 10 contracts in their respective first weeks of trading.\n\"This is obviously unique because it captures the election,\" said Chris Murphy, co-head of derivative strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group. \n\n \n"

        "article_content": " \n\n\n\nWhat Happened:\nShares of online accommodations platform Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB)\njumped 5% in the afternoon session after the company revealed plans to increase fees charged to guests for cross-currency bookings. This means that whenever a guest pays for a booking using a different currency from the one set by the host, there would be an additional fee of as much as 2%. The company noted that the additional fee could result in a guest service fee of up to 16.5% of the booking subtotal. \nMore important than the details of the fees associated with cross-currency bookings is the bigger-picture international volume opportunity. This news is likely increasing bullishness among investors that Airbnb is focused on expanding into new markets to meet the growing demand for its offerings. Notably, during the Q3'2023 earnings call, management highlighted the improved momentum in the international market as cross-border nights booked grew 17% compared to the previous year. In a letter to shareholders, the company added, \"As international travel continues to recover, we're building greater momentum for Airbnb in under-penetrated markets. In Asia Pacific, our business has fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels, with gross nights growing 23% in Q3 2023 compared to Q3 2019. China outbound travel increased over 100% in Q3 2023 compared to a year ago. Smaller Asia Pacific markets such as Taiwan, the Philippines, Thailand, Hong Kong, and Indonesia all experienced year-over-year growth above 30% for gross nights booked on an origin basis.\"\nIs now the time to buy Airbnb? Find out by reading the original article on StockStory.\nWhat is the market telling us:\nAirbnb's shares are quite volatile and over the last year have had 16 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. \nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 9 months ago, when the stock dropped 10.6% on the news that the company reported first quarter results that beat analysts' gross bookings, revenue, earnings per share (EPS), and free cash flow estimates. However, room nights, revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance for the next quarter came in below Consensus, with the weak EBITDA guidance attributed to \"changes in the expected timing of marketing spend relative to the prior year.\" Additionally, full-year 2023 EBITDA margin was projected to be similar to 2022, which was slightly below expectations and shows that the company will not be getting operating leverage on expenses for the year. Overall, it was a negative quarter for the company given the outlook for the business.\nAirbnb is up 11.7% since the beginning of the year, and at $150.09 per share it is trading close to its 52-week high of $153.33 from July 2023. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Airbnb's shares at the IPO in December 2020 would now be looking at an investment worth $1,038."

        "article_content": " \n\n \n\nBy Rajesh Kumar Singh and Shivansh Tiwary\n(Reuters) -JetBlue Airways on Friday raised doubts about the future of its $3.8 billion merger deal with  Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE), saying it might be unable to meet certain conditions required as part of the agreement for unspecified reasons. \nAs a result, JetBlue said it had informed Spirit that the merger agreement might be terminated as early as Sunday.\nShares of Spirit were down 9.5% at $6.54 on Friday afternoon, adding to their losses of about 55% this month which were sparked by a U.S. judge's move to block the deal. JetBlue's shares were up 3.5% at $5.53.\nJetBlue said it continues to evaluate options under the agreement and, unless the agreement is terminated, it would abide by its merger obligations. The New York-based airline could not immediately be reached for comment.\nIn response, Spirit said there was no basis for terminating the merger agreement. It said it would continue to abide by its obligations and was expecting JetBlue to do the same.\nWithout the JetBlue deal, Spirit faces a rough road ahead as the ultra-low-cost carrier has grappled with weak demand in its key markets as it seeks to return to sustainable profitability. Some analysts have even suggested the company could face bankruptcy if it cannot shore up finances.\nSpirit has said it is assessing options to refinance its 2025 debt maturities, and is not pursuing or involved in a statutory restructuring. \nLast week, the company said the amount of compensation it expects to receive from supplier Pratt & Whitney over several jets that were grounded would be a significant source of liquidity over the next couple of years.\nEarlier this month, a U.S. judge blocked the airline's planned merger with JetBlue, after finding that the proposed deal could threaten competition in the U.S. aviation market and harm ticket prices. Both airlines have said they will appeal the ruling.\nUnder the merger agreement, Jan. 28 is the deadline for the deal's closure. If regulatory approval has not arrived by that date, there is an automatic provision to extend the deadline until July 24, 2024. Regulators have yet to approve the deal as of Friday.\nJetBlue's move is aimed at either forcing a termination of the deal or restructuring it at a new purchase price, said Steve Segal, M&A attorney at business law firm Buchalter.\nSegal said mounting concerns about Spirit's finances and its future might be deemed to constitute a \"material adverse effect,\" offering JetBlue a legal argument to call off the deal without triggering the July extension.\nJetBlue is mindful that Spirit's business has deteriorated significantly since the two agreed on the tie-up in July 2022, sources have told Reuters.\nIf the appeals court reaffirms the lower court's ruling, \"JetBlue shareholders could breathe a sigh of relief that the carrier would not have to assume Spirit Airlines' high debt load or its cash-burning operations,\" Citi analyst Stephen Trent wrote in a note. Trent said there is a probability of only 2% that the appeal will succeed.\nWhen Spirit originally accepted JetBlue's acquisition offer, the market value of its equity was $3.8 billion. Its enterprise value, inclusive of its outstanding debt at the time, was $7.6 billion.

Welcome to Northrop Grumman's Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2023 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. My name is Josh, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.\nTodd Ernst: Thanks, Josh. Good morning and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Fourth Quarter 2023 Conference Call. This morning, we'll refer to a presentation that is posted to our IR website. Before we get started, matters discussed on today's call, including guidance and outlooks for 2024 and beyond reflect the company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including those noted in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially. Today's call will include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release. And on the call today are Kathy Warden, our Chair, CEO and President; and Dave Keffer, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?\nKathy Warden: Thanks Todd. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Before discussing our 2023 results, I wanted to take a moment to thank our team for their hard work and dedication to our important mission. Our talented workforce which is now over a 100,000 strong continues to deliver some of the most advanced technologies in the world. These capabilities are used by our customer\u2019s everyday to defend freedom and deter aggression around the globe. The geopolitical landscape has grown even more complex driving continued increases in global security spending. Our strategies has positioned us well to compete and win in this growing market which has translated into accelerating topline growth for Northrop Grumman. Revenue increased by over 7% in 2023 [indiscernible] more than a billion above the midpoint of our original 2023 guidance. In addition, our book-to-bill for the year was 1.14 times, that\u2019s in line with our exceptional four year average. As a result of this award strength, we achieved a new record backlog which now exceeds $84 billion and now provides a healthy foundation for our continued growth. The underlying performance of our company is strong. We generated free cash flow at the high end of our guidance range, and we comfortably exceeded our sales and EPS guidance range, absence of B-21 charge. While we're disappointed that our assessment of conditions for the low rate initial production portion of the B-21 program necessitated this charge in the quarter, we are confident in our ability to deliver on the company's forward outlook, which remains unchanged. We're also proud of the performance of the B-21 team, which continues to execute an unparalleled aircraft development program. As we look forward, we will continue to execute our business strategy, which at its core is based on technology differentiation, a laser focus on performance, and value delivery for our customers and shareholders. To support this strategy, we are prioritizing investment in our capacity and capabilities. In 2023, we invested over $2.9 billion in R&D and CapEx, that's 7.5% of sales, to continue driving innovation and capacity to support our customer mission success. We also delivered over $2.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, representing a return of approximately 125% of our 2023 free cash flow. So now I'll highlight a few examples of progress we've made across the portfolio that further bolster my confidence in our future. Shortly after the close of the fourth quarter, we announced our GEM 63XL solid rocket boosters helped to successfully power ULA\u2019s Vulcan launch vehicle on its first mission. Future Vulcan missions will utilize additional GEM 63XLs in support of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Kuiper, and other ULA customers, providing a significant growth opportunity for our propulsion business. And this is an important milestone because it supports our investment to significantly ramp production capacity of GEM 63s in the coming years. Global demand for our weapons system increased in 2023, and we expect this trend to continue. In this market, we're both a supplier and a prime. We're a supplier of propulsion systems, warheads, fuses, and cannons across a highly diversified customer base, and a prime contractor for predominantly air-to-ground missiles, including AARGM, AARGM-ER, and Stand-in Attack Weapon. Weapons systems currently represents approximately 7% of total revenue, and based on the demands we're seeing, we expect this business to grow faster than the company average for the foreseeable future, with a significant portion of this expansion coming from international customers. In our Mission Systems business, demand remains exceptionally strong, with a 2023 book-to-bill above 1.2 times, the highest of all of our segments. As we've seen in recent years, the restricted portfolio of Mission Systems is a meaningful driver of growth as our customers pursue solutions that enable them to operate inside the decision loop of potential adversaries who are also advancing their computing capabilities. We are helping our customers stay ahead by developing advanced microelectronics, sensors, processors, and secure communication. Our product lines are enabling faster cycles of modernization, positioning our customers with decision advantage in this rapidly advancing technology environment. And we continue to make significant progress on the EMD phase of Sentinel, which is the next generation land-based leg of the strategic triad. We are achieving milestones to mature the design and reduce risk, including key test activities, such as the successful static fire test of the Sentinel Stage 2 solid rocket motor for the missile earlier this month. Last week, the Air Force submitted to Congress a new set of cost estimates for the program, which triggered a Nunn-McCurdy Breach. This in turn launches a review of the program by the Department of Defense, which we expect to be ongoing for the next several months. It's important to note that the cost growth is primarily driven by estimates for the command and launch facility build-out, which is part of the military construction and procurement phases of the program. We and our industry team are continuing to perform on the EMD phase in close partnership with the U.S. Air Force. And we'll work with the government to explore opportunities to reduce costs on the program with a focus on the late 2020s and beyond when the program is expected to move into the procurement phase. And in the fourth quarter, the B-21 entered its flight test phase. This is a major milestone for the program and achieving it within the baseline schedule is a credit to the Northrop Grumman team and our close partnership with the U.S. Air Force over the past several years. Following this milestone, we were awarded the first LRIP lot in the fourth quarter and production is now underway. Let me take a few moments to provide a little more detail on the B-21 charge. The possibility of which we started talking with you about at this time last year. As you know, like all of industry, we and our suppliers have experienced cost pressure from recent global macroeconomic conditions, which are significantly different from the assumptions the team made when bidding these five production lots in 2015. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we again reviewed our estimated profitability on the LRIP phase of the program. And we now believe it is probable each of the first five LRIP lots will be performed at a loss. The charge is largely driven by a change in our assumptions regarding funding to mitigate the impact of macroeconomic disruptions on the LRIP phase of the program and higher projected manufacturing costs that reflect recent supplier negotiations and our experience in completing the first aircraft. The after tax cash impact related to these updates will be spread over a number of years. Importantly, we have absorbed this effect and we have not changed our outlook for free cash flow growth over the next several years. This is a game changing capability that will be of great value to our nation. And we are focused on executing the program in a way that also delivers value to our shareholders over the coming decades. Turning now to the budget environment. Global national security spending is increasing as the U.S. and allies invest in capabilities to deter and defend against aggression. Demand for our capabilities remain strong due to our differentiated portfolio and alignment to customer priorities including the triad, space and weapons. In the U.S., our franchise programs remain well supported by Congress and the Department of Defense. And this gives us confidence in our outlook even in a constrained U.S. budget environment. We are pleased to have an NDAA in place that provides continued support for defense spending. And we're hopeful that Congress will enact appropriations soon. Our guidance assumes we will not have a shutdown or a full year CR, and we're encouraged by the progress we've seen so far towards passing appropriations in the March timeframe. Additionally, we are monitoring progress on supplemental funding and we see opportunities in expanding the industrial base and increasing munitions production in this pending request. Our allies are also increasing their defense spending and we expect our alignment with their needs for aircraft, weapon systems and mission systems to be an additional source of growth. So as we look to the future, we have the right portfolio and team to deliver on our long-term outlook. Our organic sales have grown at a greater than 5% annual rate since 2019. And our guidance calls for continued growth of 4% to 5% in 2024. Segment operating margin dollars are expected to grow at roughly the same rate as sales in 2024. And our 2024 EPS guidance range of $24.45 to $24.85 at the midpoint represents roughly 6% growth excluding the B-21 charge and 11% growth compared to our initial EPS estimates which we provided for in 2023. In addition, the structural building blocks to expand our margins that we outlined in last year's 2Q earnings call, including dissipating macroeconomic headwinds, implementation of productivity and cost savings initiatives and future favorable mix shift remain in place. We are laser focused on performance and bid discipline to drive margin expansion. And importantly, we continue to expect our free cash flow to grow at a double digit rate over the coming years. We are reaffirming our 2024 and 2025 free cash flow outlook. And we've also introduced a 2026 outlook of $3.3 billion at the midpoint. With the businesses generating significant cash flow, we have considerable flexibility in deploying capital to generate value for customers and shareholders. Our top priority remains investing to support our business strategy. And we expect to invest over 7% of sales again in 2024 in capital expenditures and R&D. At the same time, we'll continue to provide strong capital returns to our shareholders. Last month, our board of directors increased our share repurchase authorization by an additional $2.5 billion, and we ended the year with a remaining authorization of $3.6 billion. For 2024, we expect to increase our share repurchases to at least $2 billion. This includes a $1 billion ASR that we plan to initiate in the coming days based on the strong liquidity position with which we entered this year. So when we take these factors, sustainable top-line growth with expanding margins, and couple those with declining capital intensity and lower projected cash taxes, you get a recipe for robust cash flow growth for years to come. So now I'll turn it over to Dave to provide you more details on the segment results, 2024 guidance, and the forward outlook. Dave?\nDave Keffer: Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. We finished the year with strong momentum, enabling us to reaffirm and build upon our favorable forward outlook. I'll start by elaborating on our 2023 results and then provide additional details on our guidance. On the demand side, we ended 2023 with over $84 billion in backlog, a new record for our company. All four of our segments generated a full-year book-to-bill ratio over one-time sales. We also continued to deliver strong top-line results with Q4 sales of $10.6 billion, up 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Full-year sales were even stronger, up over 7% at $39.3 billion, or roughly $300 million higher than our latest guidance. These top-line results were enabled not only by the strong demand environment we're seeing among our customers, but also by our ability to ramp on new programs, expand our workforce, and convert our backlog into sales. Moving to segment results, we generated sales growth in each of our businesses in 2023. Aeronautics sales were up 2% for the year, returning to growth earlier than previously expected. AS growth was driven by higher volume on restricted programs that more than offset declines on mature production programs. DS posted sales growth of 5%, led by higher volume in the weapons and missile defense portfolio. Mission System sales were also up 5%, driven by higher restricted sales on advanced microelectronics programs and higher volume on marine systems programs. And our space business posted another quarter of double-digit top-line growth, with sales up approximately 14% for the year. Nearly 40% of the growth came from Sentinel and NGI, with the rest coming from our broad space portfolio. As Kathy described, our segment margins included a charge for the B-21 program. The charge was primarily driven by the confluence of lower assumptions around macroeconomic disruption funding and higher production cost projections. While the full pre-tax charge had the effect of lowering our segment margins, only $143 million has been recorded as an EAC adjustment, including a $43 million reduction to Q4 sales. The remaining was booked as a contingent liability because the majority of the lots have yet to be awarded. The charge also led to an $82 million benefit in corporate unallocated expense, stemming from a reduction in deferred state taxes. Continuing with our results, slide 5 shows a comparison of our 2023 earnings per share to the guidance we provided in October. Diluted EPS includes a $2.08 unfavorable mark-to-market adjustment from our pension plans and a $7.68 per share impact from the B-21 charge. Absent these items, we would have exceeded the high end of our prior EPS guidance range by over $0.40. Our 2023 mark-to-market adjusted EPS also included significantly less pension income compared to 2022. In total, net pension costs generated a $4.07 per share headwind in 2023. Next, I'll take a few moments to discuss our cash flows. As is our historical pattern, we had an outstanding quarter of cash performance in Q4, generating $1.6 billion in free cash flow. For the full year, our operating cash flow was $3.9 billion, and our free cash flow was $2.1 billion. This result was near the high end of our guidance range and represented free cash flow growth of 30% compared to 2022. Turning to pension results, we generated strong asset returns of roughly 11% in 2023, ahead of our long-term assumptions. The FAS discount rate declined by roughly 40 basis points to 5.15%. Netted together, along with updated census data, this generated a mark-to-market pension expense of $422 million in our GAAP results. Slide 7 in our earnings deck summarizes our pension estimates for the next three years. We continue to expect CAS recoveries to increase from current levels, providing a benefit to our cash flows, but slightly less than prior projections. And we expect a higher level of non-operating FAS pension income in the coming years, driven by our strong asset returns in 2023. In total, our funded status remains superb at nearly 100%, and we continue to project minimal cash pension contributions over the next several years. Turning to 2024, slide 9 in our earnings deck includes our segment-level guidance. Building off the strong top-line results in Q4, we now expect aeronautics sales in the low 11 billions, driven by growth on B-21 and on other programs such as F-35 and E-2D. This is higher than our prior sales estimates for AS, which reflected a flat 2023 and modest growth in 2024. Higher B-21 sales also result in a slightly lower margin rate expectation for AS, which we now project in the mid-9%, netting out to a similar volume of margin dollars compared to prior estimates. DS sales are expected to be roughly $6 billion, up low single digits from 2023. As we mentioned on the Q3 call, DS has really turned the corner on growth through strong demand for weapons and missile defense capabilities. We are optimistic in our ability to convert these opportunities into sustained growth in this business over time, which we expect to be partially offset by modest declines in the sustainment and training portions of the business. Margins are projected to remain strong at DS in the low 12% range. Mission System sales are expected in the low to mid $11 billion range for another year of mid-single digit growth, with margins of roughly 15%. And that space, after expanding sales at a greater than 17% CAGR since 2019, growth is expected to moderate in 2024 with higher segment margins. Space sales are now expected in the mid-to-high $14 billion range, with margins of approximately 9%. The mid-single digit growth rate in space reflects declines in a restricted program due to shifts in government priority, which are more than offset by growth in other parts of the space portfolio. Having built a tremendous backlog in recent years, space now has an opportunity to deliver strong ROI through more measured growth, along with margin expansion and cash generation. At the company level, our guidance reflects growth in sales and segment margin between 4% 5%, absent the B-21 charge, consistent with the outlook we provided on our October call, even after delivering top line upside in Q4. We expect another solid year of bookings, with a book-to-bill around one times. And similar to our cadence over the last few years, we expect sales to ramp throughout the year, with first quarter sales a little less than 24% of our full year estimate. We plan to be in the market soon for new debt issuance to take advantage of the favorable rate environment. The proceeds from the debt issuance will also be used in part to support refinancings of $1.5 billion of notes that are coming due in January of 2025, as well as for general corporate purposes and share repurchases, including the $1 billion ASR we intend to initiate in the coming days. We've reflected this debt issuance in our interest expense guidance, and we'd also expect interest income to contribute to the EPS line, as it did in 2023. We project an effective tax rate of approximately 17% in 2024, consistent with the range we've experienced over the last few years, excluding the mark-to-market adjustment and other unique items. We're coming closer to conclusions on a number of open audit and appeals processes with the IRS, which could have positive or negative effects on book and cash taxes as they're resolved over the next couple of years, and our forward guidance does not include any such adjustments. Similarly, we have not factored any potential changes to R&D tax legislation into our outlook. And as a reminder, our interpretation of current tax law results in a projected 5-year impact from R&D amortization of approximately $2 billion. We will continue to track these matters carefully and provide updates as they progress. In total, we expect our 2024 earnings per share to be between $24.45 and $24.85 on with approximately 148.5 million weighted shares outstanding. Moving to cash, we expect 2024 free cash flow between $2.25 billion and $2.65 billion consistent with our prior outlook. And as we've said before, capital expenditures are expected to remain elevated in 2024 before moderating in 2025 and beyond. Slide 11 in our earnings deck provides an update to our long-term free cash flow outlook to include 2026. We continue to expect our free cash flow to grow at a double-digit rate for several more years with additional growth in the second half of the decade. This expansion will be driven by sustained growth in our business, generating strong operating margin volume and converting those profits into cash. Meanwhile, lower cash taxes, higher CAS recoveries and lower levels of capital spending in the coming years provide additional structural levers to expand our cash flows at a rapid rate. Importantly, these ranges also include the latest estimated cash impacts associated with the B-21 charge. We expect roughly 60% of the charge to affect cash flows through 2026 with the remainder in the following years. Longer-term, we are confident we'll be able to continue to absorb the cash headwinds from B-21 while delivering excellent free cash flows in 2027 and beyond. In closing, I want to thank the entire Northrop Grumman team for their contributions to another great year. The strength of our portfolio and visibility of franchise programs provides us the opportunity to deliver and deploy robust cash flows as we execute on our strategy. And with that, let's open up the call to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you.[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley.

And is there still a possibility of future relief?\nKathy Warden: So Kristine, we've been working with the customer. And as we noted, the conversations continue. And last year, in 2023, we and Air Force disclosed that about $60 million of $1.5 billion that Congress appropriated for inflation was allocated to the advanced procurement for Lot 1 on this program. But we have yet to work through what that relief may be in future lots. We have, of course, as we said, updated our assumptions -- and through conversation and the tight budget environment, we've actually lowered the expectations for inflation relief. And so at this point, our focus is on executing this program and finding opportunities in the performance on the program while we continue to work with the government to see if there is any inflation relief opportunity.\nKristine Liwag: Great, thank you. And I\u2019ll keep it to one today. Thank you.\nKathy Warden: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Richard  Safran  (EPA:SAF) with Seaport Global. You may proceed.\nRichard Safran: Kathy, Dave good morning. So I know you're going to get a lot of questions on the B-21, but I thought I'd ask you about to expand on your opening remarks about Sentinel. I thought you might talk a bit more about the actions you're taking at the program back on track. How are you seeing risk on the program right now? And I guess, importantly, what you think the government's level support for the program is given all the headlines and what we've been seeing?\nKathy Warden: Yes. Thanks, Rich. So as the land-based leg of the nuclear triad, Sentinel is a top priority for the Department of Defense. The requirement for the program has been validated numerous times by multiple administrations, and we expect that to be the outcome of this latest review. As the Air Force is reported, the non-operating cost reach on the program is largely due to cost growth in the military construction and procurement segments of the program, and we and the industry team are currently executing on the cost plus EMD phase of the program. That's important because our design work in this phase is helping the Air Force to better estimate the costs of those later phases and due to a number of factors of learning their cost estimates for these later phases have increased, and that's what's driving the non-[indiscernible] breach as the Air Force has said, growth on the EMD would not have triggered the breach. I'll also note that their update captures the inflation since 2020, the last time they did a cost estimate. And we all know that there's been significantly higher inflation than what was assumed at that time. So some of that is what you're also seeing reflected in these latest cost estimates. I mean with that said, though, you asked about our performance on the program, and I'm really pleased to report on the progress that our team has made over the last 3 years while we've been executing on the EMD phase. We've on boarded thousands of engineers. We've matured the system design. We've produced and tested critical hardware in the missile system, as I've outlined earlier on the call. We've also engaged in risk reduction, which is helping to inform the Air Force launch facility modernization and we've done all this while also doing detailed planning for the future phase of the program. I myself have visited the missile fields actually, I was at one last Friday, which is part of why I've got this cold, I brought back. And I met with the Airmen [ph], who have committed themselves to this important mission. So we're all in. We know how important this is our team is partnering closely with the Air Force, and we're going to help them to deliver this essential capability for our nation.\nRichard Safran: Thanks for that. Feel better.\nKathy Warden: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. You may proceed.\nRonald Epstein: Hey good morning everyone. So maybe just jumping back to B-21. Charges like there's some programs have a tendency to accumulate over time. They don't tend to go the other way. How should we think about it as we go forward? I mean, this is what for the first 5 LRIPs, how many LRIPs could there be? And how do we think about the bounds on this? And then maybe one last thing. Is the program NPV positive and if it is, when does it actually become NPV positive, cash flow positive and so on and so forth. If you could just peel back the onion on the program.\nDavid Keffer: Sure. I can go ahead and get started with that. And see if we can address a number of questions you raised. First of all, in terms of the future, we'll continue to update our projections every quarter as we do with all of our large programs. But it's important to note, we have a lot more information today than we did at this time last year, having completed the production in the ground test phase of the first aircraft. We also have the majority of the suppliers now under contract with the remaining in advanced stages of negotiations. We have our latest estimates for productivity and reasonable learning curves that we believe are appropriate based on our historical experience. Of course, we now have one lot under contract, and we'll finalize quantities of the next four lots over time as well. In the economy and inflationary factors have stabilized a bit over the past year, and we'll continue to track those, of course, over time as well. But perhaps most importantly, we're still performing well on this program, which is continuing to provide a critical capability for our customers. In terms of the long-term NPV, we think that's the most important thing is that our customers will get great value from the aircraft. We'll deliver them over time, and that should, over time, also lead to value for the company and our shareholders.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Douglas Harned with Bernstein. You may proceed.\nDouglas Harned: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to go back to the Sentinel program. And when -- what you've described is that I think because that EMD is going well. But when you look at where this is headed and what came out with the Air Force commentary on the Nunn-McCurdy breach. A couple of things that I wanted to understand better. They're talking about potentially a 2-year delay in IOC, they're also -- also you talked about it a little bit, but to understand how much of this breach is due to potential changes in requirements and things that are, in a sense, under your purview versus those that may be under others, including the government customer?\nKathy Warden: Yes. So as you note, there is a delay to IOC, the reason though for the Nunn-McCurdy breach is the cost growth. So oftentimes scheduled delays add costs to the program, that is not the primary contributor. It is, as you noted, design decisions, particularly related to the command and launch requirements that the Air Force has and that affects the deployment in the launch facilities in each of the silos. And so that is what we are working to inform the Air Force decision process on alternatives and ways to reduce those costs and procurement and yet those are Air Force cost estimates, and they include a significant amount of scope that is outside of the industry team's execution. But nonetheless, we will help to inform those discussions if they're ongoing during this review process.\nDouglas Harned: And does the delay in the timing, does this have much effect right now on your outlook for the overall profitability of the program.\nKathy Warden: It does not, Doug, our near-term assumptions on both the ramp of the program relative to sales as well as the profitability of the program are not materially impacted.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. You may proceed.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning everyone. Thank you. Kathy or Dave, maybe if you could just talk about the free cash flow guidance that you're sticking with the 15% CAGR. Just the drivers in terms of top line working capital, Section 174, and the impact of B-21, Dave, I think you said 60% of that over $600 million is through 2026. Is that right? And do we think about Sentinel as a positive cash contributor?\nDavid Keffer: Sure. Thanks for the question, Sheila. I'm happy to dig into that. The strength of the free cash flow outlook we really think of as one of the highlights our report today. And so happy to dig into that in more detail. And I think you heard correctly that 60% of the charge is associated with the period through 2026 from a cash flow perspective. I think importantly, the strength of the broad base of other programs across the business is serving to offset those pressures. And that's what we're seeing in our ability to maintain and build confidence in our multiyear outlook including adding a strong 2026 year to that outlook that continues the double-digit growth trajectory that we expect for the next several years. We had a great finish to 2023 for free cash flow, really strong working capital performance, and that is enabling us to build confidence in our ability to continue to perform at similar levels going forward. As a company, we've put a lot of focus on working capital efficiency, on capital efficiency, on driving cash returns on recent investments and that is clearly showing up in the results and the performance of all of our sectors. We're proud of their performance on cash in Q4 and in the outlooks for 2024 and beyond. And the net effect of all of these factors is that unchanged free cash flow outlook for 2024 and 2025, along with a strong 2026. I'd highlight in terms of what drives that going forward? What's the underlying force as you point out? Certainly, the operations of the business growth in the top line is, first and foremost, with an opportunity for growth at the margin rate line as well that leads to really strong margin dollar volume, which will convert into cash through the strong working capital performance that we expect to continue which is essentially a stable assumption in our outlook. We're not looking for significant additional efficiencies given just how strong we were at the end of 2023. And then as we noted earlier, there are other structural factors that should help as well with CAS pension reimbursement growing slightly over the next few years and cash tax is projected to decline over that same period. So essentially, all of those factors will lead to strong -- strong free cash flow growth outlook for the next several years and beyond.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\nSeth Seifman: Thanks very much. And good morning. I guess a 2-part question about B-21. First was the $143 million EAC in the quarter, is that the extent of the entire anticipated loss on lot 1 and I guess, how do we think about the progression of losses on the various lots? And then second, the fact that this charge includes lots that will be in budgets in 2026 and 2027 and not come under contract for a while and not be worked on for a while. I guess how would you assess the opportunity to maybe ultimately do a little bit better than anticipated here.\nDavid Keffer: Sure. I can start on that, Seth. I think you've read properly into the $143 million EAC adjustment with Lot 1 having been awarded and the other is not yet awarded, that one does take the form of an EAC adjustment. So that $143 million is the lot 1 amount we are currently projecting. And the future progression while we can't get into much detail because that would involve a lot sizes and quantities and other classified details. Clearly, the implication is that there's modest growth from lot 1 to future lots on average. Over time, I think you're thinking of this the right way that our current projections would indicate an average of a couple of hundred million dollars a year of after-tax impact on our -- on the cash line from B-21, and that's, as I referred to a few minutes ago, the headwind we've been able to mitigate through strength in the rest of the business. In terms of your point about opportunity to outperform that over the long-term. Clearly, it is a core focus of our team to continue to drive efficiencies in the learning curves, successful outcomes of our negotiations with suppliers. We continue to engage and partner with our customer to understand macroeconomic impacts on the program and address opportunities for funding of relief, as Kathy mentioned earlier. And so we'll continue to address all of those opportunities. This is something we'll update you in the rest of the Street on over time.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with TD Cowen. You may proceed.\nCai Von Rumohr: Thanks so much. Kathy best wishes to feel better.\nKathy Warden: It sounds like you need those wishes as well.\nCai Von Rumohr: So anyway, so you had the loss on the B-21 kind of it didn't look like a loss couple of quarters ago. You've had your second loss on Halo. This is clearly proving to be an environment where on fixed price contract, there is more risk. Have you changed your strategy regarding how you bid and specifically with reference to Tranche 2 of the tracking satellites because you were on Tranche 1 and you were not on Tranche 2. So have you changed your strategy in terms of how you're bidding? And are there any contracts that you bid before changing your strategy that would still have risk that we're not aware of today?\nKathy Warden: Very insightful question as always, Cai. So when you look back to 2015, when we did B-21, we certainly have changed our view on bidding of contracts where did not have a mature design. It's a point of bid and yet we committed to fixed price options into the future. And we have, to my knowledge, not done that again. And we have passed on some high-profile programs as a result of the risk balance that the customer put forward in the RFP not meeting our standards. We have programs like Halo, which we have certainly learned some additional lessons and are applying those as we move forward. And you note on some very recent bids, we have taken a different approach in looking at firm fixed price, where we've either declined a bit if the customer chose to go fixed price or we've offered a price -- in the case of SDA Tranche 2 that we thought was fair and reasonable and the customer decided not to further negotiate with us. These are things that are going to happen and we're going to remain disciplined. We have plenty of opportunity in this company to grow. We have a strong pipeline of opportunities we're pursuing. And a strong pipeline of opportunities that we believe have the right risk/reward balance with industry.\nCai Von Rumohr: Thanks so much. Feel better.\nKathy Warden: Thank you too.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Gavin Parsons (NYSE:PSN) with UBS. You may proceed.\nGavin Parsons: Thanks, good morning.\nKathy Warden: Good morning.\nGavin Parsons: Maybe just following on Ron's question. Does the B-21 charge contemplate current conditions as they are? Does it have some consideration for future uncertainty in macro or supply chain?\nKathy Warden: With all of our EACs, B-21 included, we do our best based on what we know today to project conditions out into the future. Now with that said, that's difficult to do longer-term that period of performance is. So in this case, we're looking out over greater than 5 years. So as we get into those out years, that's a bit more speculative, but we do incorporate our expectations for changes in everything from material labor pricing to productivity and learning.\nGavin Parsons: Okay. Understood. And Dave, you mentioned the IRS appeal process. Any way to put a range around the possible cash impact on that?\nDavid Keffer: No, I'd refer you to our tax disclosures for more than enough detail on all of those fronts. It's tough to put a range around those things. We're looking forward to getting through processes, as you know, from those disclosures, we have a lot of open years that have yet to be resolved and looking forward to working with the IRS to come to reasonable resolutions there, and we'll update you on any book or tax differences from current reserves as we get there.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.\nScott Deuschle: Hey good morning.\nKathy Warden: Good morning.\nScott Deuschle: Dave, can you give us a sense for the proportion of supplier costs across the 5 LRIP lots that have now been fixed versus what's still open to negotiation?\nDavid Keffer: Sure. As we noted a few moments ago, we're now at a majority of the supplier costs that have been fully negotiated across the LRIP phase. And we're in various stages of negotiation with suppliers for the remainder. So that's one area where we have learn more and progressed in our process compared to where we were a year ago or even a quarter ago.\nScott Deuschle: Okay. Great. And then just as a follow-up, where does the commercial inventory come from in the space business? And is that EBIT headwind mostly gone now? Or is there any more of that left to come in 2024? Thank you.\nDavid Keffer: Sure. Thanks for the question. We had offsetting effects in 2024 and 2023, rather, including Q4 in the commercial elements of the space business. As you know, those are much smaller than and kind of tangential to the core national security space business that we have. In the case of those commercial inventory write-downs, those were related to newer investments in product lines to address burgeoning market opportunity in both the government and commercial elements of the space market. We did see some modest write-downs in various quarters in 2023 associated with those. Those are the types of things you occasionally go through as you make such new investments. So again, not core to the current or future growth story of the space business.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.\nKenneth Herbert: Yes, thank you good morning. Maybe, Kathy, at a high level, I wanted to follow up on your comments earlier regarding sort of the key margin drivers you outlined last year. Specifically more on the cost and productivity efforts and maybe on the mix side, are you seeing incrementally more opportunity now as we think about 2024? And how should we think about sort of the absolute opportunity on those now into this year versus perhaps how much more of a benefit we see in 2025 and beyond.\nKathy Warden: Thanks, Ken. We laid out 3 drivers, the first of which being stabilization in macroeconomics, and we are certainly seeing that in 2024, which is why we see our margin rates this year in line with last with some opportunity for improvement as we go throughout the year. We layer on top of that cost and productivity actions that we are taking in the company, and that will provide some tailwinds in 2024 growing tailwinds into 2025. And the mix shift really is a bit of a longer-term proposition for us. We've talked about that being a shift from cost type to fixed price, where we expect 2023 was really our high watermark for cost type, but a very gradual shift in that mix to fixed price with more of it coming in the latter half of this decade. And then international mix is the other where we don't expect significant international growth in 2024, but we do expect that to step up based on our pipeline and particularly the strong weapons demand outside the U.S. in 2025. That gives you a sense of what will be a tailwind to margin rate win.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.\nMyles Walton: Thanks, good morning. I was wondering, Dave, or Kathy, you previously talked about a $4 billion free cash flow target in 2028, effectively doubling what you've done in 2023. I just want to make sure that's still on the table, despite the charge absorption in that period of time? And then maybe, Kathy, on the margin expansion specific to Aerospace, is that still a 10% margin business? Or do we have to glide slope down a little bit further into 2025, 2026.\nDavid Keffer: Thanks for the question, Myles. Let me kick off with the 2023 free cash flow number. I appreciate the question on that because I think that too is core to the outlook going forward. Yes, we are reaffirming that $4 billion target for 2028. And essentially doubling the level that we were projecting at the midpoint of our 2023 guidance, which was $2 billion. Of course, we exceeded that by $100 million in our final result for 2023. The drivers of that growth are much of what we've talked about already. Certainly, growth in the top line. As Kathy just noted, some of the drivers of margin rate expansion opportunity which leads to margin dollars having an opportunity to exceed the growth rate of our top line through 2028. And importantly, CapEx will moderate during that same period. So we've noted that 2023 and 2024 of these peak years of capital intensity that continues to be our outlook with declines in 2025 and beyond. And then pension and tax will serve as tailwinds during that same period. So that leads you to the $4 billion number. And I think if you look at the 2024 and 2025 numbers we've reiterated for our free cash outlook today and add in that 2026 range, you'll get to that same glide slope that would push you upward toward the $4 billion number by 2028. So those are the building blocks and the way we plan to get there.\nKathy Warden: And Myles, on AS margins, what we're seeing, as Dave noted earlier is that with the B-21 growth being a bit stronger than we had anticipated, AS is stepping up on top line. It is putting some pressure on margin rate, but margin dollars are exactly where we had anticipated they would be coming into 2024, and our guide therefore, remained consistent for AS on a dollar basis, even though we now are looking at more of a mid-9s rate projection. As you go out over time, it's less dependent on what happens with absorbing that lower rate on B-21 and more what happens in terms of other new programs coming into the AS portfolio and the rate at which we will book those programs. So we'll provide you more insight into that over the coming year as we look towards 2025 and beyond.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. You may proceed.\nRobert Spingarn: Hey good morning. Kathy, a few minutes ago, you alluded to international and I wanted to bring up IBCS because it's had some strong demand signals from international customers and thought maybe you could dig into that program a little bit, give us a sense of how large it is in revenue or how -- in 2023 or 2024? And how big it might be, let's say, 5 years from now?\nKathy Warden: It certainly is an area of strength in our portfolio. We've seen strong performance by the team on the U.S. Army program and also as we are deploying in Poland, and we see follow-on opportunities in Poland as a result. We've also, as I\u2019ve spoken about throughout the course of 2023, added a number of additional countries who have expressed interest in the program to the pipeline, and that's what would drive the growth that we anticipate in the 2025 time frame. As you noted, I mentioned international demand. Part of that is weapons part of that is the IBCS portfolio. And then, of course, we have some aircraft and mission system strength in the pipeline for international in 2025 as well. The program itself is growing at a fairly rapid rate, but off of a relatively small it's about $400 million of annual sales. And we expect that to grow, of course, but not a major contributor is the enterprise line for growth.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. You may proceed.\nGeorge Shapiro: Good morning. Kathy, I wanted to ask on the charge for the B-21, what caused it to be bigger than the 0 to $1.2 billion range that you've kind of been reiterating since last year? And then just specifically, maybe the margin that you had said would be around 10% is now maybe 9.5%. I know you alluded to a few minutes ago, the B-21 was growing faster. But it\u2019s got to grow a lot faster to drop the margin by 50 basis points. So I was just wondering if you could explore that a little bit more. Thanks very much.\nKathy Warden: Let me start with the first part of your question and Dave will cover the second. As we noted, we identified this risk last year, and we, throughout the year, revisited it on a quarterly basis. There were 2 primary changes in the fourth quarter that both led us to deem it probable loss as well as impacted the value of that loss. First, we significantly reduced our projections for funding related to macroeconomic impacts, as we've talked about a couple of times already. Although we continue to partner with the government to address these impacts. We believe it's prudent in light of the current budget status to reduce those assumptions. And so we did that. The second is we've experienced growth in our cost projection, both in the internal production costs as we've continued to build aircraft as Dave talked about through our negotiations with suppliers. We have learned and built that learning into the forward-looking estimates that we now have in the EAC, so those were the factors. As we've talked about, we did a very detailed look at this EAC in the fourth quarter and had matured and had actual data to reflect on that we did not have at an earlier point.\nDavid Keffer: Let me follow up on the second part of your question because I do think it's an important nuance. The AS business was operating in the mid-10 billions in scale over the past year, it exceeded our original expectations in sales in 2023 and now is projected to exceed them even more significantly compared to where they were a year ago in 2024. We were talking about a flat 2023 and very modest growth in 2024 based off of that mid-tens level. And now we're all the way up into the low 11s. And so that low 11s at a mid-9% margin rate is the same as the mid-to-high 10s at a slightly higher margin rate. We're really focused on driving the dollar volume of operating margin in our Aeronautics business and across our business, it's that return on invested capital, the growth in margin dollars and in free cash flow that results from it, that is really our core focus.\nTodd Ernst: Josh, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our final question. Our final question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi. You may proceed.\nJason Gursky: Hey good morning everybody. Dave, just a clarification question for you to start. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that there were some shifting priorities from the government and the space business that was leading to a deceleration in growth. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on what those shifting priorities might be? And then Kathy, I just wanted to provide you maybe a bit of an open-ended question to kind of wrap all this together here. Just broadly talk about all the risks and opportunities that you see in front of you on the execution side of things. You've obviously got record backlog here and we know about the B-21 risk. But I'm wondering if you could just maybe highlight and wrap this all together, do we have a balanced risk and opportunities portfolio here, we a little bit more overweight risk than we are opportunity? And maybe just kind of dive into a little bit of the details of what you're seeing and maybe what you're all doing to address those issues. Thanks.\nDavid Keffer: Sure. Great questions, Jason. Let me go ahead and start with your original question on the national security space portfolio. As we mentioned, our guidance captures growth and declines in various programs across all of our portfolios, very much including space. In the case of space, as we've noted, there are some shifts in budget priorities. A lot of our customers are having to address budget prioritization, particularly as it relates to 2025 and beyond. With that said, in this particular case, given that it's in the restricted domain, there's not much more we can say about the mission or the program or anything like that. What's important there is that our space sector, and therefore, company guidance accounts for our latest understanding of all the programs in that portfolio and the likely path forward for them. And I think when you look at the space guidance, you see a lot of value creation as they continue to grow the top line. And in this case, now grow margin rates alongside that with lower capital intensity starting in 2025, in particular, you see a lot of improvement in returns on invested capital in the space business, given how much growth they've built in their foundation over the last few years.\nJason Gursky: Kathy?\nKathy Warden: And Jason, I really appreciate the question. I wish I had another hour to discuss it with you, but being respectful of everybody's time, let me just simply say that I see our portfolio and the set of opportunities and risks we have as balanced and consistent with what I have seen in recent years since I stepped into this role. We have a team who has stepped up and provided top line growth, which I believe is industry leading at about 5% on a compound annual basis each of the last four years. We're projecting that again this year. We see the opportunity space is rich, both domestically and internationally. And to the risks that we have in executing this portfolio, while the pandemic certainly made that more challenging for the last couple of years. We're turning the corner. Our overall program performance has not been stronger since I've been at the company, and that's 15 years and going. So I really feel good about how this team is positioned. We now have fully disclosed and taken into the P&L the B-21 risk, which we've been talking about and feel confident that we can now go execute this program. And I am proud of what the team collectively has accomplished across 2023 and look forward to the outlook we have in place for 2024. So with that, I just want to again thank my colleagues at Northrop Grumman for their dedication, both to our country and our company. I also want to thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in April. So Josh, that concludes the call. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you.

        "article_content": " \n\n Northrop Grumman  Corporation (NYSE:NOC), a global aerospace and defense technology company, reported robust financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023, with a positive outlook for 2024. The company's revenue saw a 7% increase in 2023, surpassing their own guidance, and a book-to-bill ratio of 1.14 times. A record backlog of over $84 billion lays a solid foundation for future growth. Northrop Grumman delivered $2.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and plans to increase share repurchases to at least $2 billion in 2024. The company's strong performance is attributed to its diverse portfolio, which includes the B-21 aircraft, and increasing global security spending. Despite a charge related to the B-21 program, Northrop Grumman is confident in its future, expecting sales growth of 4-5% and a 6% increase in EPS in 2024, excluding the B-21 charge.\nIn conclusion, Northrop Grumman's financial performance in 2023 and projections for 2024 indicate a company that is strategically positioned for continued growth and shareholder return. With a robust backlog and a clear strategy to navigate the dynamic defense sector, Northrop Grumman remains a key player in the global security landscape.\nNorthrop Grumman Corporation (NOC) has demonstrated resilience and strategic foresight in the face of industry challenges, as reflected in its financial performance and outlook.

Welcome to Northrop Grumman's Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2023 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. My name is Josh, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.\nTodd Ernst: Thanks, Josh. Good morning and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Fourth Quarter 2023 Conference Call. This morning, we'll refer to a presentation that is posted to our IR website. Before we get started, matters discussed on today's call, including guidance and outlooks for 2024 and beyond reflect the company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including those noted in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially. Today's call will include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release. And on the call today are Kathy Warden, our Chair, CEO and President; and Dave Keffer, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?\nKathy Warden: Thanks Todd. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Before discussing our 2023 results, I wanted to take a moment to thank our team for their hard work and dedication to our important mission. Our talented workforce which is now over a 100,000 strong continues to deliver some of the most advanced technologies in the world. These capabilities are used by our customer\u2019s everyday to defend freedom and deter aggression around the globe. The geopolitical landscape has grown even more complex driving continued increases in global security spending. Our strategies has positioned us well to compete and win in this growing market which has translated into accelerating topline growth for Northrop Grumman. Revenue increased by over 7% in 2023 [indiscernible] more than a billion above the midpoint of our original 2023 guidance. In addition, our book-to-bill for the year was 1.14 times, that\u2019s in line with our exceptional four year average. As a result of this award strength, we achieved a new record backlog which now exceeds $84 billion and now provides a healthy foundation for our continued growth. The underlying performance of our company is strong. We generated free cash flow at the high end of our guidance range, and we comfortably exceeded our sales and EPS guidance range, absence of B-21 charge. While we're disappointed that our assessment of conditions for the low rate initial production portion of the B-21 program necessitated this charge in the quarter, we are confident in our ability to deliver on the company's forward outlook, which remains unchanged. We're also proud of the performance of the B-21 team, which continues to execute an unparalleled aircraft development program. As we look forward, we will continue to execute our business strategy, which at its core is based on technology differentiation, a laser focus on performance, and value delivery for our customers and shareholders. To support this strategy, we are prioritizing investment in our capacity and capabilities. In 2023, we invested over $2.9 billion in R&D and CapEx, that's 7.5% of sales, to continue driving innovation and capacity to support our customer mission success. We also delivered over $2.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, representing a return of approximately 125% of our 2023 free cash flow. So now I'll highlight a few examples of progress we've made across the portfolio that further bolster my confidence in our future. Shortly after the close of the fourth quarter, we announced our GEM 63XL solid rocket boosters helped to successfully power ULA\u2019s Vulcan launch vehicle on its first mission. Future Vulcan missions will utilize additional GEM 63XLs in support of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Kuiper, and other ULA customers, providing a significant growth opportunity for our propulsion business. And this is an important milestone because it supports our investment to significantly ramp production capacity of GEM 63s in the coming years. Global demand for our weapons system increased in 2023, and we expect this trend to continue. In this market, we're both a supplier and a prime. We're a supplier of propulsion systems, warheads, fuses, and cannons across a highly diversified customer base, and a prime contractor for predominantly air-to-ground missiles, including AARGM, AARGM-ER, and Stand-in Attack Weapon. Weapons systems currently represents approximately 7% of total revenue, and based on the demands we're seeing, we expect this business to grow faster than the company average for the foreseeable future, with a significant portion of this expansion coming from international customers. In our Mission Systems business, demand remains exceptionally strong, with a 2023 book-to-bill above 1.2 times, the highest of all of our segments. As we've seen in recent years, the restricted portfolio of Mission Systems is a meaningful driver of growth as our customers pursue solutions that enable them to operate inside the decision loop of potential adversaries who are also advancing their computing capabilities. We are helping our customers stay ahead by developing advanced microelectronics, sensors, processors, and secure communication. Our product lines are enabling faster cycles of modernization, positioning our customers with decision advantage in this rapidly advancing technology environment. And we continue to make significant progress on the EMD phase of Sentinel, which is the next generation land-based leg of the strategic triad. We are achieving milestones to mature the design and reduce risk, including key test activities, such as the successful static fire test of the Sentinel Stage 2 solid rocket motor for the missile earlier this month. Last week, the Air Force submitted to Congress a new set of cost estimates for the program, which triggered a Nunn-McCurdy Breach. This in turn launches a review of the program by the Department of Defense, which we expect to be ongoing for the next several months. It's important to note that the cost growth is primarily driven by estimates for the command and launch facility build-out, which is part of the military construction and procurement phases of the program. We and our industry team are continuing to perform on the EMD phase in close partnership with the U.S. Air Force. And we'll work with the government to explore opportunities to reduce costs on the program with a focus on the late 2020s and beyond when the program is expected to move into the procurement phase. And in the fourth quarter, the B-21 entered its flight test phase. This is a major milestone for the program and achieving it within the baseline schedule is a credit to the Northrop Grumman team and our close partnership with the U.S. Air Force over the past several years. Following this milestone, we were awarded the first LRIP lot in the fourth quarter and production is now underway. Let me take a few moments to provide a little more detail on the B-21 charge. The possibility of which we started talking with you about at this time last year. As you know, like all of industry, we and our suppliers have experienced cost pressure from recent global macroeconomic conditions, which are significantly different from the assumptions the team made when bidding these five production lots in 2015. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we again reviewed our estimated profitability on the LRIP phase of the program. And we now believe it is probable each of the first five LRIP lots will be performed at a loss. The charge is largely driven by a change in our assumptions regarding funding to mitigate the impact of macroeconomic disruptions on the LRIP phase of the program and higher projected manufacturing costs that reflect recent supplier negotiations and our experience in completing the first aircraft. The after tax cash impact related to these updates will be spread over a number of years. Importantly, we have absorbed this effect and we have not changed our outlook for free cash flow growth over the next several years. This is a game changing capability that will be of great value to our nation. And we are focused on executing the program in a way that also delivers value to our shareholders over the coming decades. Turning now to the budget environment. Global national security spending is increasing as the U.S. and allies invest in capabilities to deter and defend against aggression. Demand for our capabilities remain strong due to our differentiated portfolio and alignment to customer priorities including the triad, space and weapons. In the U.S., our franchise programs remain well supported by Congress and the Department of Defense. And this gives us confidence in our outlook even in a constrained U.S. budget environment. We are pleased to have an NDAA in place that provides continued support for defense spending. And we're hopeful that Congress will enact appropriations soon. Our guidance assumes we will not have a shutdown or a full year CR, and we're encouraged by the progress we've seen so far towards passing appropriations in the March timeframe. Additionally, we are monitoring progress on supplemental funding and we see opportunities in expanding the industrial base and increasing munitions production in this pending request. Our allies are also increasing their defense spending and we expect our alignment with their needs for aircraft, weapon systems and mission systems to be an additional source of growth. So as we look to the future, we have the right portfolio and team to deliver on our long-term outlook. Our organic sales have grown at a greater than 5% annual rate since 2019. And our guidance calls for continued growth of 4% to 5% in 2024. Segment operating margin dollars are expected to grow at roughly the same rate as sales in 2024. And our 2024 EPS guidance range of $24.45 to $24.85 at the midpoint represents roughly 6% growth excluding the B-21 charge and 11% growth compared to our initial EPS estimates which we provided for in 2023. In addition, the structural building blocks to expand our margins that we outlined in last year's 2Q earnings call, including dissipating macroeconomic headwinds, implementation of productivity and cost savings initiatives and future favorable mix shift remain in place. We are laser focused on performance and bid discipline to drive margin expansion. And importantly, we continue to expect our free cash flow to grow at a double digit rate over the coming years. We are reaffirming our 2024 and 2025 free cash flow outlook. And we've also introduced a 2026 outlook of $3.3 billion at the midpoint. With the businesses generating significant cash flow, we have considerable flexibility in deploying capital to generate value for customers and shareholders. Our top priority remains investing to support our business strategy. And we expect to invest over 7% of sales again in 2024 in capital expenditures and R&D. At the same time, we'll continue to provide strong capital returns to our shareholders. Last month, our board of directors increased our share repurchase authorization by an additional $2.5 billion, and we ended the year with a remaining authorization of $3.6 billion. For 2024, we expect to increase our share repurchases to at least $2 billion. This includes a $1 billion ASR that we plan to initiate in the coming days based on the strong liquidity position with which we entered this year. So when we take these factors, sustainable top-line growth with expanding margins, and couple those with declining capital intensity and lower projected cash taxes, you get a recipe for robust cash flow growth for years to come. So now I'll turn it over to Dave to provide you more details on the segment results, 2024 guidance, and the forward outlook. Dave?\nDave Keffer: Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. We finished the year with strong momentum, enabling us to reaffirm and build upon our favorable forward outlook. I'll start by elaborating on our 2023 results and then provide additional details on our guidance. On the demand side, we ended 2023 with over $84 billion in backlog, a new record for our company. All four of our segments generated a full-year book-to-bill ratio over one-time sales. We also continued to deliver strong top-line results with Q4 sales of $10.6 billion, up 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Full-year sales were even stronger, up over 7% at $39.3 billion, or roughly $300 million higher than our latest guidance. These top-line results were enabled not only by the strong demand environment we're seeing among our customers, but also by our ability to ramp on new programs, expand our workforce, and convert our backlog into sales. Moving to segment results, we generated sales growth in each of our businesses in 2023. Aeronautics sales were up 2% for the year, returning to growth earlier than previously expected. AS growth was driven by higher volume on restricted programs that more than offset declines on mature production programs. DS posted sales growth of 5%, led by higher volume in the weapons and missile defense portfolio. Mission System sales were also up 5%, driven by higher restricted sales on advanced microelectronics programs and higher volume on marine systems programs. And our space business posted another quarter of double-digit top-line growth, with sales up approximately 14% for the year. Nearly 40% of the growth came from Sentinel and NGI, with the rest coming from our broad space portfolio. As Kathy described, our segment margins included a charge for the B-21 program. The charge was primarily driven by the confluence of lower assumptions around macroeconomic disruption funding and higher production cost projections. While the full pre-tax charge had the effect of lowering our segment margins, only $143 million has been recorded as an EAC adjustment, including a $43 million reduction to Q4 sales. The remaining was booked as a contingent liability because the majority of the lots have yet to be awarded. The charge also led to an $82 million benefit in corporate unallocated expense, stemming from a reduction in deferred state taxes. Continuing with our results, slide 5 shows a comparison of our 2023 earnings per share to the guidance we provided in October. Diluted EPS includes a $2.08 unfavorable mark-to-market adjustment from our pension plans and a $7.68 per share impact from the B-21 charge. Absent these items, we would have exceeded the high end of our prior EPS guidance range by over $0.40. Our 2023 mark-to-market adjusted EPS also included significantly less pension income compared to 2022. In total, net pension costs generated a $4.07 per share headwind in 2023. Next, I'll take a few moments to discuss our cash flows. As is our historical pattern, we had an outstanding quarter of cash performance in Q4, generating $1.6 billion in free cash flow. For the full year, our operating cash flow was $3.9 billion, and our free cash flow was $2.1 billion. This result was near the high end of our guidance range and represented free cash flow growth of 30% compared to 2022. Turning to pension results, we generated strong asset returns of roughly 11% in 2023, ahead of our long-term assumptions. The FAS discount rate declined by roughly 40 basis points to 5.15%. Netted together, along with updated census data, this generated a mark-to-market pension expense of $422 million in our GAAP results. Slide 7 in our earnings deck summarizes our pension estimates for the next three years. We continue to expect CAS recoveries to increase from current levels, providing a benefit to our cash flows, but slightly less than prior projections. And we expect a higher level of non-operating FAS pension income in the coming years, driven by our strong asset returns in 2023. In total, our funded status remains superb at nearly 100%, and we continue to project minimal cash pension contributions over the next several years. Turning to 2024, slide 9 in our earnings deck includes our segment-level guidance. Building off the strong top-line results in Q4, we now expect aeronautics sales in the low 11 billions, driven by growth on B-21 and on other programs such as F-35 and E-2D. This is higher than our prior sales estimates for AS, which reflected a flat 2023 and modest growth in 2024. Higher B-21 sales also result in a slightly lower margin rate expectation for AS, which we now project in the mid-9%, netting out to a similar volume of margin dollars compared to prior estimates. DS sales are expected to be roughly $6 billion, up low single digits from 2023. As we mentioned on the Q3 call, DS has really turned the corner on growth through strong demand for weapons and missile defense capabilities. We are optimistic in our ability to convert these opportunities into sustained growth in this business over time, which we expect to be partially offset by modest declines in the sustainment and training portions of the business. Margins are projected to remain strong at DS in the low 12% range. Mission System sales are expected in the low to mid $11 billion range for another year of mid-single digit growth, with margins of roughly 15%. And that space, after expanding sales at a greater than 17% CAGR since 2019, growth is expected to moderate in 2024 with higher segment margins. Space sales are now expected in the mid-to-high $14 billion range, with margins of approximately 9%. The mid-single digit growth rate in space reflects declines in a restricted program due to shifts in government priority, which are more than offset by growth in other parts of the space portfolio. Having built a tremendous backlog in recent years, space now has an opportunity to deliver strong ROI through more measured growth, along with margin expansion and cash generation. At the company level, our guidance reflects growth in sales and segment margin between 4% 5%, absent the B-21 charge, consistent with the outlook we provided on our October call, even after delivering top line upside in Q4. We expect another solid year of bookings, with a book-to-bill around one times. And similar to our cadence over the last few years, we expect sales to ramp throughout the year, with first quarter sales a little less than 24% of our full year estimate. We plan to be in the market soon for new debt issuance to take advantage of the favorable rate environment. The proceeds from the debt issuance will also be used in part to support refinancings of $1.5 billion of notes that are coming due in January of 2025, as well as for general corporate purposes and share repurchases, including the $1 billion ASR we intend to initiate in the coming days. We've reflected this debt issuance in our interest expense guidance, and we'd also expect interest income to contribute to the EPS line, as it did in 2023. We project an effective tax rate of approximately 17% in 2024, consistent with the range we've experienced over the last few years, excluding the mark-to-market adjustment and other unique items. We're coming closer to conclusions on a number of open audit and appeals processes with the IRS, which could have positive or negative effects on book and cash taxes as they're resolved over the next couple of years, and our forward guidance does not include any such adjustments. Similarly, we have not factored any potential changes to R&D tax legislation into our outlook. And as a reminder, our interpretation of current tax law results in a projected 5-year impact from R&D amortization of approximately $2 billion. We will continue to track these matters carefully and provide updates as they progress. In total, we expect our 2024 earnings per share to be between $24.45 and $24.85 on with approximately 148.5 million weighted shares outstanding. Moving to cash, we expect 2024 free cash flow between $2.25 billion and $2.65 billion consistent with our prior outlook. And as we've said before, capital expenditures are expected to remain elevated in 2024 before moderating in 2025 and beyond. Slide 11 in our earnings deck provides an update to our long-term free cash flow outlook to include 2026. We continue to expect our free cash flow to grow at a double-digit rate for several more years with additional growth in the second half of the decade. This expansion will be driven by sustained growth in our business, generating strong operating margin volume and converting those profits into cash. Meanwhile, lower cash taxes, higher CAS recoveries and lower levels of capital spending in the coming years provide additional structural levers to expand our cash flows at a rapid rate. Importantly, these ranges also include the latest estimated cash impacts associated with the B-21 charge. We expect roughly 60% of the charge to affect cash flows through 2026 with the remainder in the following years. Longer-term, we are confident we'll be able to continue to absorb the cash headwinds from B-21 while delivering excellent free cash flows in 2027 and beyond. In closing, I want to thank the entire Northrop Grumman team for their contributions to another great year. The strength of our portfolio and visibility of franchise programs provides us the opportunity to deliver and deploy robust cash flows as we execute on our strategy. And with that, let's open up the call to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you.[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\nKristine Liwag: Hey good morning, Kathy and Dave.\nKathy Warden: Good morning.\nKristine Liwag: Kathy, on the B-21, you've been very clear about the pressures on this program. Ultimately, how much relief did the customer extend to you to offset macro pressures and elevate [ph] portion. And is there still a possibility of future relief?\nKathy Warden: So Kristine, we've been working with the customer. And as we noted, the conversations continue. And last year, in 2023, we and Air Force disclosed that about $60 million of $1.5 billion that Congress appropriated for inflation was allocated to the advanced procurement for Lot 1 on this program. But we have yet to work through what that relief may be in future lots. We have, of course, as we said, updated our assumptions -- and through conversation and the tight budget environment, we've actually lowered the expectations for inflation relief. And so at this point, our focus is on executing this program and finding opportunities in the performance on the program while we continue to work with the government to see if there is any inflation relief opportunity.\nKristine Liwag: Great, thank you. And I\u2019ll keep it to one today. Thank you.\nKathy Warden: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Richard  Safran  (EPA:SAF) with Seaport Global. You may proceed.\nRichard Safran: Kathy, Dave good morning. So I know you're going to get a lot of questions on the B-21, but I thought I'd ask you about to expand on your opening remarks about Sentinel. I thought you might talk a bit more about the actions you're taking at the program back on track. How are you seeing risk on the program right now? And I guess, importantly, what you think the government's level support for the program is given all the headlines and what we've been seeing?\nKathy Warden: Yes. Thanks, Rich. So as the land-based leg of the nuclear triad, Sentinel is a top priority for the Department of Defense. The requirement for the program has been validated numerous times by multiple administrations, and we expect that to be the outcome of this latest review. As the Air Force is reported, the non-operating cost reach on the program is largely due to cost growth in the military construction and procurement segments of the program, and we and the industry team are currently executing on the cost plus EMD phase of the program. That's important because our design work in this phase is helping the Air Force to better estimate the costs of those later phases and due to a number of factors of learning their cost estimates for these later phases have increased, and that's what's driving the non-[indiscernible] breach as the Air Force has said, growth on the EMD would not have triggered the breach. I'll also note that their update captures the inflation since 2020, the last time they did a cost estimate. And we all know that there's been significantly higher inflation than what was assumed at that time. So some of that is what you're also seeing reflected in these latest cost estimates. I mean with that said, though, you asked about our performance on the program, and I'm really pleased to report on the progress that our team has made over the last 3 years while we've been executing on the EMD phase. We've on boarded thousands of engineers. We've matured the system design. We've produced and tested critical hardware in the missile system, as I've outlined earlier on the call. We've also engaged in risk reduction, which is helping to inform the Air Force launch facility modernization and we've done all this while also doing detailed planning for the future phase of the program. I myself have visited the missile fields actually, I was at one last Friday, which is part of why I've got this cold, I brought back. And I met with the Airmen [ph], who have committed themselves to this important mission. So we're all in. We know how important this is our team is partnering closely with the Air Force, and we're going to help them to deliver this essential capability for our nation.\nRichard Safran: Thanks for that. Feel better.\nKathy Warden: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. You may proceed.\nRonald Epstein: Hey good morning everyone. So maybe just jumping back to B-21. Charges like there's some programs have a tendency to accumulate over time. They don't tend to go the other way. How should we think about it as we go forward? I mean, this is what for the first 5 LRIPs, how many LRIPs could there be? And how do we think about the bounds on this? And then maybe one last thing. Is the program NPV positive and if it is, when does it actually become NPV positive, cash flow positive and so on and so forth. If you could just peel back the onion on the program.\nDavid Keffer: Sure. I can go ahead and get started with that. And see if we can address a number of questions you raised. First of all, in terms of the future, we'll continue to update our projections every quarter as we do with all of our large programs. But it's important to note, we have a lot more information today than we did at this time last year, having completed the production in the ground test phase of the first aircraft. We also have the majority of the suppliers now under contract with the remaining in advanced stages of negotiations. We have our latest estimates for productivity and reasonable learning curves that we believe are appropriate based on our historical experience. Of course, we now have one lot under contract, and we'll finalize quantities of the next four lots over time as well. In the economy and inflationary factors have stabilized a bit over the past year, and we'll continue to track those, of course, over time as well. But perhaps most importantly, we're still performing well on this program, which is continuing to provide a critical capability for our customers. In terms of the long-term NPV, we think that's the most important thing is that our customers will get great value from the aircraft. We'll deliver them over time, and that should, over time, also lead to value for the company and our shareholders.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Douglas Harned with Bernstein. You may proceed.\nDouglas Harned: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to go back to the Sentinel program. And when -- what you've described is that I think because that EMD is going well. But when you look at where this is headed and what came out with the Air Force commentary on the Nunn-McCurdy breach. A couple of things that I wanted to understand better. They're talking about potentially a 2-year delay in IOC, they're also -- also you talked about it a little bit, but to understand how much of this breach is due to potential changes in requirements and things that are, in a sense, under your purview versus those that may be under others, including the government customer?\nKathy Warden: Yes. So as you note, there is a delay to IOC, the reason though for the Nunn-McCurdy breach is the cost growth. So oftentimes scheduled delays add costs to the program, that is not the primary contributor. It is, as you noted, design decisions, particularly related to the command and launch requirements that the Air Force has and that affects the deployment in the launch facilities in each of the silos. And so that is what we are working to inform the Air Force decision process on alternatives and ways to reduce those costs and procurement and yet those are Air Force cost estimates, and they include a significant amount of scope that is outside of the industry team's execution. But nonetheless, we will help to inform those discussions if they're ongoing during this review process.\nDouglas Harned: And does the delay in the timing, does this have much effect right now on your outlook for the overall profitability of the program.\nKathy Warden: It does not, Doug, our near-term assumptions on both the ramp of the program relative to sales as well as the profitability of the program are not materially impacted.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. You may proceed.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning everyone. Thank you. Kathy or Dave, maybe if you could just talk about the free cash flow guidance that you're sticking with the 15% CAGR. Just the drivers in terms of top line working capital, Section 174, and the impact of B-21, Dave, I think you said 60% of that over $600 million is through 2026. Is that right? And do we think about Sentinel as a positive cash contributor?\nDavid Keffer: Sure. Thanks for the question, Sheila. I'm happy to dig into that. The strength of the free cash flow outlook we really think of as one of the highlights our report today. And so happy to dig into that in more detail. And I think you heard correctly that 60% of the charge is associated with the period through 2026 from a cash flow perspective. I think importantly, the strength of the broad base of other programs across the business is serving to offset those pressures. And that's what we're seeing in our ability to maintain and build confidence in our multiyear outlook including adding a strong 2026 year to that outlook that continues the double-digit growth trajectory that we expect for the next several years. We had a great finish to 2023 for free cash flow, really strong working capital performance, and that is enabling us to build confidence in our ability to continue to perform at similar levels going forward. As a company, we've put a lot of focus on working capital efficiency, on capital efficiency, on driving cash returns on recent investments and that is clearly showing up in the results and the performance of all of our sectors. We're proud of their performance on cash in Q4 and in the outlooks for 2024 and beyond. And the net effect of all of these factors is that unchanged free cash flow outlook for 2024 and 2025, along with a strong 2026. I'd highlight in terms of what drives that going forward? What's the underlying force as you point out? Certainly, the operations of the business growth in the top line is, first and foremost, with an opportunity for growth at the margin rate line as well that leads to really strong margin dollar volume, which will convert into cash through the strong working capital performance that we expect to continue which is essentially a stable assumption in our outlook. We're not looking for significant additional efficiencies given just how strong we were at the end of 2023. And then as we noted earlier, there are other structural factors that should help as well with CAS pension reimbursement growing slightly over the next few years and cash tax is projected to decline over that same period. So essentially, all of those factors will lead to strong -- strong free cash flow growth outlook for the next several years and beyond.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\nSeth Seifman: Thanks very much. And good morning. I guess a 2-part question about B-21. First was the $143 million EAC in the quarter, is that the extent of the entire anticipated loss on lot 1 and I guess, how do we think about the progression of losses on the various lots? And then second, the fact that this charge includes lots that will be in budgets in 2026 and 2027 and not come under contract for a while and not be worked on for a while. I guess how would you assess the opportunity to maybe ultimately do a little bit better than anticipated here.\nDavid Keffer: Sure. I can start on that, Seth. I think you've read properly into the $143 million EAC adjustment with Lot 1 having been awarded and the other is not yet awarded, that one does take the form of an EAC adjustment. So that $143 million is the lot 1 amount we are currently projecting. And the future progression while we can't get into much detail because that would involve a lot sizes and quantities and other classified details. Clearly, the implication is that there's modest growth from lot 1 to future lots on average. Over time, I think you're thinking of this the right way that our current projections would indicate an average of a couple of hundred million dollars a year of after-tax impact on our -- on the cash line from B-21, and that's, as I referred to a few minutes ago, the headwind we've been able to mitigate through strength in the rest of the business. In terms of your point about opportunity to outperform that over the long-term. Clearly, it is a core focus of our team to continue to drive efficiencies in the learning curves, successful outcomes of our negotiations with suppliers. We continue to engage and partner with our customer to understand macroeconomic impacts on the program and address opportunities for funding of relief, as Kathy mentioned earlier. And so we'll continue to address all of those opportunities. This is something we'll update you in the rest of the Street on over time.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with TD Cowen. You may proceed.\nCai Von Rumohr: Thanks so much. Kathy best wishes to feel better.\nKathy Warden: It sounds like you need those wishes as well.\nCai Von Rumohr: So anyway, so you had the loss on the B-21 kind of it didn't look like a loss couple of quarters ago. You've had your second loss on Halo. This is clearly proving to be an environment where on fixed price contract, there is more risk. Have you changed your strategy regarding how you bid and specifically with reference to Tranche 2 of the tracking satellites because you were on Tranche 1 and you were not on Tranche 2. So have you changed your strategy in terms of how you're bidding? And are there any contracts that you bid before changing your strategy that would still have risk that we're not aware of today?\nKathy Warden: Very insightful question as always, Cai. So when you look back to 2015, when we did B-21, we certainly have changed our view on bidding of contracts where did not have a mature design. It's a point of bid and yet we committed to fixed price options into the future. And we have, to my knowledge, not done that again. And we have passed on some high-profile programs as a result of the risk balance that the customer put forward in the RFP not meeting our standards. We have programs like Halo, which we have certainly learned some additional lessons and are applying those as we move forward. And you note on some very recent bids, we have taken a different approach in looking at firm fixed price, where we've either declined a bit if the customer chose to go fixed price or we've offered a price -- in the case of SDA Tranche 2 that we thought was fair and reasonable and the customer decided not to further negotiate with us. These are things that are going to happen and we're going to remain disciplined. We have plenty of opportunity in this company to grow. We have a strong pipeline of opportunities we're pursuing. And a strong pipeline of opportunities that we believe have the right risk/reward balance with industry.\nCai Von Rumohr: Thanks so much. Feel better.\nKathy Warden: Thank you too.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Gavin Parsons (NYSE:PSN) with UBS. You may proceed.\nGavin Parsons: Thanks, good morning.\nKathy Warden: Good morning.\nGavin Parsons: Maybe just following on Ron's question. Does the B-21 charge contemplate current conditions as they are? Does it have some consideration for future uncertainty in macro or supply chain?\nKathy Warden: With all of our EACs, B-21 included, we do our best based on what we know today to project conditions out into the future. Now with that said, that's difficult to do longer-term that period of performance is. So in this case, we're looking out over greater than 5 years. So as we get into those out years, that's a bit more speculative, but we do incorporate our expectations for changes in everything from material labor pricing to productivity and learning.\nGavin Parsons: Okay. Understood. And Dave, you mentioned the IRS appeal process. Any way to put a range around the possible cash impact on that?\nDavid Keffer: No, I'd refer you to our tax disclosures for more than enough detail on all of those fronts. It's tough to put a range around those things. We're looking forward to getting through processes, as you know, from those disclosures, we have a lot of open years that have yet to be resolved and looking forward to working with the IRS to come to reasonable resolutions there, and we'll update you on any book or tax differences from current reserves as we get there.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.\nScott Deuschle: Hey good morning.\nKathy Warden: Good morning.\nScott Deuschle: Dave, can you give us a sense for the proportion of supplier costs across the 5 LRIP lots that have now been fixed versus what's still open to negotiation?\nDavid Keffer: Sure. As we noted a few moments ago, we're now at a majority of the supplier costs that have been fully negotiated across the LRIP phase. And we're in various stages of negotiation with suppliers for the remainder. So that's one area where we have learn more and progressed in our process compared to where we were a year ago or even a quarter ago.\nScott Deuschle: Okay. Great. And then just as a follow-up, where does the commercial inventory come from in the space business? And is that EBIT headwind mostly gone now? Or is there any more of that left to come in 2024? Thank you.\nDavid Keffer: Sure. Thanks for the question. We had offsetting effects in 2024 and 2023, rather, including Q4 in the commercial elements of the space business. As you know, those are much smaller than and kind of tangential to the core national security space business that we have. In the case of those commercial inventory write-downs, those were related to newer investments in product lines to address burgeoning market opportunity in both the government and commercial elements of the space market. We did see some modest write-downs in various quarters in 2023 associated with those. Those are the types of things you occasionally go through as you make such new investments. So again, not core to the current or future growth story of the space business.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.\nKenneth Herbert: Yes, thank you good morning. Maybe, Kathy, at a high level, I wanted to follow up on your comments earlier regarding sort of the key margin drivers you outlined last year. Specifically more on the cost and productivity efforts and maybe on the mix side, are you seeing incrementally more opportunity now as we think about 2024? And how should we think about sort of the absolute opportunity on those now into this year versus perhaps how much more of a benefit we see in 2025 and beyond.\nKathy Warden: Thanks, Ken. We laid out 3 drivers, the first of which being stabilization in macroeconomics, and we are certainly seeing that in 2024, which is why we see our margin rates this year in line with last with some opportunity for improvement as we go throughout the year. We layer on top of that cost and productivity actions that we are taking in the company, and that will provide some tailwinds in 2024 growing tailwinds into 2025. And the mix shift really is a bit of a longer-term proposition for us. We've talked about that being a shift from cost type to fixed price, where we expect 2023 was really our high watermark for cost type, but a very gradual shift in that mix to fixed price with more of it coming in the latter half of this decade. And then international mix is the other where we don't expect significant international growth in 2024, but we do expect that to step up based on our pipeline and particularly the strong weapons demand outside the U.S. in 2025. That gives you a sense of what will be a tailwind to margin rate win.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.\nMyles Walton: Thanks, good morning. I was wondering, Dave, or Kathy, you previously talked about a $4 billion free cash flow target in 2028, effectively doubling what you've done in 2023. I just want to make sure that's still on the table, despite the charge absorption in that period of time? And then maybe, Kathy, on the margin expansion specific to Aerospace, is that still a 10% margin business? Or do we have to glide slope down a little bit further into 2025, 2026.\nDavid Keffer: Thanks for the question, Myles. Let me kick off with the 2023 free cash flow number. I appreciate the question on that because I think that too is core to the outlook going forward. Yes, we are reaffirming that $4 billion target for 2028. And essentially doubling the level that we were projecting at the midpoint of our 2023 guidance, which was $2 billion. Of course, we exceeded that by $100 million in our final result for 2023. The drivers of that growth are much of what we've talked about already. Certainly, growth in the top line. As Kathy just noted, some of the drivers of margin rate expansion opportunity which leads to margin dollars having an opportunity to exceed the growth rate of our top line through 2028. And importantly, CapEx will moderate during that same period. So we've noted that 2023 and 2024 of these peak years of capital intensity that continues to be our outlook with declines in 2025 and beyond. And then pension and tax will serve as tailwinds during that same period. So that leads you to the $4 billion number. And I think if you look at the 2024 and 2025 numbers we've reiterated for our free cash outlook today and add in that 2026 range, you'll get to that same glide slope that would push you upward toward the $4 billion number by 2028. So those are the building blocks and the way we plan to get there.\nKathy Warden: And Myles, on AS margins, what we're seeing, as Dave noted earlier is that with the B-21 growth being a bit stronger than we had anticipated, AS is stepping up on top line. It is putting some pressure on margin rate, but margin dollars are exactly where we had anticipated they would be coming into 2024, and our guide therefore, remained consistent for AS on a dollar basis, even though we now are looking at more of a mid-9s rate projection. As you go out over time, it's less dependent on what happens with absorbing that lower rate on B-21 and more what happens in terms of other new programs coming into the AS portfolio and the rate at which we will book those programs. So we'll provide you more insight into that over the coming year as we look towards 2025 and beyond.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. You may proceed.\nRobert Spingarn: Hey good morning. Kathy, a few minutes ago, you alluded to international and I wanted to bring up IBCS because it's had some strong demand signals from international customers and thought maybe you could dig into that program a little bit, give us a sense of how large it is in revenue or how -- in 2023 or 2024? And how big it might be, let's say, 5 years from now?\nKathy Warden: It certainly is an area of strength in our portfolio. We've seen strong performance by the team on the U.S. Army program and also as we are deploying in Poland, and we see follow-on opportunities in Poland as a result. We've also, as I\u2019ve spoken about throughout the course of 2023, added a number of additional countries who have expressed interest in the program to the pipeline, and that's what would drive the growth that we anticipate in the 2025 time frame. As you noted, I mentioned international demand. Part of that is weapons part of that is the IBCS portfolio. And then, of course, we have some aircraft and mission system strength in the pipeline for international in 2025 as well. The program itself is growing at a fairly rapid rate, but off of a relatively small it's about $400 million of annual sales. And we expect that to grow, of course, but not a major contributor is the enterprise line for growth.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. You may proceed.\nGeorge Shapiro: Good morning. Kathy, I wanted to ask on the charge for the B-21, what caused it to be bigger than the 0 to $1.2 billion range that you've kind of been reiterating since last year? And then just specifically, maybe the margin that you had said would be around 10% is now maybe 9.5%. I know you alluded to a few minutes ago, the B-21 was growing faster. But it\u2019s got to grow a lot faster to drop the margin by 50 basis points. So I was just wondering if you could explore that a little bit more. Thanks very much.\nKathy Warden: Let me start with the first part of your question and Dave will cover the second. As we noted, we identified this risk last year, and we, throughout the year, revisited it on a quarterly basis. There were 2 primary changes in the fourth quarter that both led us to deem it probable loss as well as impacted the value of that loss. First, we significantly reduced our projections for funding related to macroeconomic impacts, as we've talked about a couple of times already. Although we continue to partner with the government to address these impacts. We believe it's prudent in light of the current budget status to reduce those assumptions. And so we did that. The second is we've experienced growth in our cost projection, both in the internal production costs as we've continued to build aircraft as Dave talked about through our negotiations with suppliers. We have learned and built that learning into the forward-looking estimates that we now have in the EAC, so those were the factors. As we've talked about, we did a very detailed look at this EAC in the fourth quarter and had matured and had actual data to reflect on that we did not have at an earlier point.\nDavid Keffer: Let me follow up on the second part of your question because I do think it's an important nuance. The AS business was operating in the mid-10 billions in scale over the past year, it exceeded our original expectations in sales in 2023 and now is projected to exceed them even more significantly compared to where they were a year ago in 2024. We were talking about a flat 2023 and very modest growth in 2024 based off of that mid-tens level. And now we're all the way up into the low 11s. And so that low 11s at a mid-9% margin rate is the same as the mid-to-high 10s at a slightly higher margin rate. We're really focused on driving the dollar volume of operating margin in our Aeronautics business and across our business, it's that return on invested capital, the growth in margin dollars and in free cash flow that results from it, that is really our core focus.\nTodd Ernst: Josh, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our final question. Our final question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi. You may proceed.\nJason Gursky: Hey good morning everybody. Dave, just a clarification question for you to start. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that there were some shifting priorities from the government and the space business that was leading to a deceleration in growth. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on what those shifting priorities might be? And then Kathy, I just wanted to provide you maybe a bit of an open-ended question to kind of wrap all this together here. Just broadly talk about all the risks and opportunities that you see in front of you on the execution side of things. You've obviously got record backlog here and we know about the B-21 risk. But I'm wondering if you could just maybe highlight and wrap this all together, do we have a balanced risk and opportunities portfolio here, we a little bit more overweight risk than we are opportunity? And maybe just kind of dive into a little bit of the details of what you're seeing and maybe what you're all doing to address those issues. Thanks.\nDavid Keffer: Sure. Great questions, Jason. Let me go ahead and start with your original question on the national security space portfolio. As we mentioned, our guidance captures growth and declines in various programs across all of our portfolios, very much including space. In the case of space, as we've noted, there are some shifts in budget priorities. A lot of our customers are having to address budget prioritization, particularly as it relates to 2025 and beyond. With that said, in this particular case, given that it's in the restricted domain, there's not much more we can say about the mission or the program or anything like that. What's important there is that our space sector, and therefore, company guidance accounts for our latest understanding of all the programs in that portfolio and the likely path forward for them. And I think when you look at the space guidance, you see a lot of value creation as they continue to grow the top line. And in this case, now grow margin rates alongside that with lower capital intensity starting in 2025, in particular, you see a lot of improvement in returns on invested capital in the space business, given how much growth they've built in their foundation over the last few years.\nJason Gursky: Kathy?\nKathy Warden: And Jason, I really appreciate the question. I wish I had another hour to discuss it with you, but being respectful of everybody's time, let me just simply say that I see our portfolio and the set of opportunities and risks we have as balanced and consistent with what I have seen in recent years since I stepped into this role. We have a team who has stepped up and provided top line growth, which I believe is industry leading at about 5% on a compound annual basis each of the last four years. We're projecting that again this year. We see the opportunity space is rich, both domestically and internationally. And to the risks that we have in executing this portfolio, while the pandemic certainly made that more challenging for the last couple of years. We're turning the corner. Our overall program performance has not been stronger since I've been at the company, and that's 15 years and going. So I really feel good about how this team is positioned. We now have fully disclosed and taken into the P&L the B-21 risk, which we've been talking about and feel confident that we can now go execute this program. And I am proud of what the team collectively has accomplished across 2023 and look forward to the outlook we have in place for 2024. So with that, I just want to again thank my colleagues at Northrop Grumman for their dedication, both to our country and our company. I also want to thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in April. So Josh, that concludes the call. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you.

Welcome to Northrop Grumman's Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2023 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. My name is Josh, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.\nTodd Ernst: Thanks, Josh. Good morning and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Fourth Quarter 2023 Conference Call. This morning, we'll refer to a presentation that is posted to our IR website. Before we get started, matters discussed on today's call, including guidance and outlooks for 2024 and beyond reflect the company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including those noted in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially. Today's call will include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release. And on the call today are Kathy Warden, our Chair, CEO and President; and Dave Keffer, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?\nKathy Warden: Thanks Todd. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Before discussing our 2023 results, I wanted to take a moment to thank our team for their hard work and dedication to our important mission. Our talented workforce which is now over a 100,000 strong continues to deliver some of the most advanced technologies in the world. These capabilities are used by our customer\u2019s everyday to defend freedom and deter aggression around the globe. The geopolitical landscape has grown even more complex driving continued increases in global security spending. Our strategies has positioned us well to compete and win in this growing market which has translated into accelerating topline growth for Northrop Grumman. Revenue increased by over 7% in 2023 [indiscernible] more than a billion above the midpoint of our original 2023 guidance. In addition, our book-to-bill for the year was 1.14 times, that\u2019s in line with our exceptional four year average. As a result of this award strength, we achieved a new record backlog which now exceeds $84 billion and now provides a healthy foundation for our continued growth. The underlying performance of our company is strong. We generated free cash flow at the high end of our guidance range, and we comfortably exceeded our sales and EPS guidance range, absence of B-21 charge. While we're disappointed that our assessment of conditions for the low rate initial production portion of the B-21 program necessitated this charge in the quarter, we are confident in our ability to deliver on the company's forward outlook, which remains unchanged. We're also proud of the performance of the B-21 team, which continues to execute an unparalleled aircraft development program. As we look forward, we will continue to execute our business strategy, which at its core is based on technology differentiation, a laser focus on performance, and value delivery for our customers and shareholders. To support this strategy, we are prioritizing investment in our capacity and capabilities. In 2023, we invested over $2.9 billion in R&D and CapEx, that's 7.5% of sales, to continue driving innovation and capacity to support our customer mission success. We also delivered over $2.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, representing a return of approximately 125% of our 2023 free cash flow. So now I'll highlight a few examples of progress we've made across the portfolio that further bolster my confidence in our future. Shortly after the close of the fourth quarter, we announced our GEM 63XL solid rocket boosters helped to successfully power ULA\u2019s Vulcan launch vehicle on its first mission. Future Vulcan missions will utilize additional GEM 63XLs in support of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Kuiper, and other ULA customers, providing a significant growth opportunity for our propulsion business. And this is an important milestone because it supports our investment to significantly ramp production capacity of GEM 63s in the coming years. Global demand for our weapons system increased in 2023, and we expect this trend to continue. In this market, we're both a supplier and a prime. We're a supplier of propulsion systems, warheads, fuses, and cannons across a highly diversified customer base, and a prime contractor for predominantly air-to-ground missiles, including AARGM, AARGM-ER, and Stand-in Attack Weapon. Weapons systems currently represents approximately 7% of total revenue, and based on the demands we're seeing, we expect this business to grow faster than the company average for the foreseeable future, with a significant portion of this expansion coming from international customers. In our Mission Systems business, demand remains exceptionally strong, with a 2023 book-to-bill above 1.2 times, the highest of all of our segments. As we've seen in recent years, the restricted portfolio of Mission Systems is a meaningful driver of growth as our customers pursue solutions that enable them to operate inside the decision loop of potential adversaries who are also advancing their computing capabilities. We are helping our customers stay ahead by developing advanced microelectronics, sensors, processors, and secure communication. Our product lines are enabling faster cycles of modernization, positioning our customers with decision advantage in this rapidly advancing technology environment. And we continue to make significant progress on the EMD phase of Sentinel, which is the next generation land-based leg of the strategic triad. We are achieving milestones to mature the design and reduce risk, including key test activities, such as the successful static fire test of the Sentinel Stage 2 solid rocket motor for the missile earlier this month. Last week, the Air Force submitted to Congress a new set of cost estimates for the program, which triggered a Nunn-McCurdy Breach. This in turn launches a review of the program by the Department of Defense, which we expect to be ongoing for the next several months. It's important to note that the cost growth is primarily driven by estimates for the command and launch facility build-out, which is part of the military construction and procurement phases of the program. We and our industry team are continuing to perform on the EMD phase in close partnership with the U.S. Air Force. And we'll work with the government to explore opportunities to reduce costs on the program with a focus on the late 2020s and beyond when the program is expected to move into the procurement phase. And in the fourth quarter, the B-21 entered its flight test phase. This is a major milestone for the program and achieving it within the baseline schedule is a credit to the Northrop Grumman team and our close partnership with the U.S. Air Force over the past several years. Following this milestone, we were awarded the first LRIP lot in the fourth quarter and production is now underway. Let me take a few moments to provide a little more detail on the B-21 charge. The possibility of which we started talking with you about at this time last year. As you know, like all of industry, we and our suppliers have experienced cost pressure from recent global macroeconomic conditions, which are significantly different from the assumptions the team made when bidding these five production lots in 2015. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we again reviewed our estimated profitability on the LRIP phase of the program. And we now believe it is probable each of the first five LRIP lots will be performed at a loss. The charge is largely driven by a change in our assumptions regarding funding to mitigate the impact of macroeconomic disruptions on the LRIP phase of the program and higher projected manufacturing costs that reflect recent supplier negotiations and our experience in completing the first aircraft. The after tax cash impact related to these updates will be spread over a number of years. Importantly, we have absorbed this effect and we have not changed our outlook for free cash flow growth over the next several years. This is a game changing capability that will be of great value to our nation. And we are focused on executing the program in a way that also delivers value to our shareholders over the coming decades. Turning now to the budget environment. Global national security spending is increasing as the U.S. and allies invest in capabilities to deter and defend against aggression. Demand for our capabilities remain strong due to our differentiated portfolio and alignment to customer priorities including the triad, space and weapons. In the U.S., our franchise programs remain well supported by Congress and the Department of Defense. And this gives us confidence in our outlook even in a constrained U.S. budget environment. We are pleased to have an NDAA in place that provides continued support for defense spending. And we're hopeful that Congress will enact appropriations soon. Our guidance assumes we will not have a shutdown or a full year CR, and we're encouraged by the progress we've seen so far towards passing appropriations in the March timeframe. Additionally, we are monitoring progress on supplemental funding and we see opportunities in expanding the industrial base and increasing munitions production in this pending request. Our allies are also increasing their defense spending and we expect our alignment with their needs for aircraft, weapon systems and mission systems to be an additional source of growth. So as we look to the future, we have the right portfolio and team to deliver on our long-term outlook. Our organic sales have grown at a greater than 5% annual rate since 2019. And our guidance calls for continued growth of 4% to 5% in 2024. Segment operating margin dollars are expected to grow at roughly the same rate as sales in 2024. And our 2024 EPS guidance range of $24.45 to $24.85 at the midpoint represents roughly 6% growth excluding the B-21 charge and 11% growth compared to our initial EPS estimates which we provided for in 2023. In addition, the structural building blocks to expand our margins that we outlined in last year's 2Q earnings call, including dissipating macroeconomic headwinds, implementation of productivity and cost savings initiatives and future favorable mix shift remain in place. We are laser focused on performance and bid discipline to drive margin expansion. And importantly, we continue to expect our free cash flow to grow at a double digit rate over the coming years. We are reaffirming our 2024 and 2025 free cash flow outlook. And we've also introduced a 2026 outlook of $3.3 billion at the midpoint. With the businesses generating significant cash flow, we have considerable flexibility in deploying capital to generate value for customers and shareholders. Our top priority remains investing to support our business strategy. And we expect to invest over 7% of sales again in 2024 in capital expenditures and R&D. At the same time, we'll continue to provide strong capital returns to our shareholders. Last month, our board of directors increased our share repurchase authorization by an additional $2.5 billion, and we ended the year with a remaining authorization of $3.6 billion. For 2024, we expect to increase our share repurchases to at least $2 billion. This includes a $1 billion ASR that we plan to initiate in the coming days based on the strong liquidity position with which we entered this year. So when we take these factors, sustainable top-line growth with expanding margins, and couple those with declining capital intensity and lower projected cash taxes, you get a recipe for robust cash flow growth for years to come. So now I'll turn it over to Dave to provide you more details on the segment results, 2024 guidance, and the forward outlook. Dave?\nDave Keffer: Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. We finished the year with strong momentum, enabling us to reaffirm and build upon our favorable forward outlook. I'll start by elaborating on our 2023 results and then provide additional details on our guidance. On the demand side, we ended 2023 with over $84 billion in backlog, a new record for our company. All four of our segments generated a full-year book-to-bill ratio over one-time sales. We also continued to deliver strong top-line results with Q4 sales of $10.6 billion, up 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Full-year sales were even stronger, up over 7% at $39.3 billion, or roughly $300 million higher than our latest guidance. These top-line results were enabled not only by the strong demand environment we're seeing among our customers, but also by our ability to ramp on new programs, expand our workforce, and convert our backlog into sales. Moving to segment results, we generated sales growth in each of our businesses in 2023. Aeronautics sales were up 2% for the year, returning to growth earlier than previously expected. AS growth was driven by higher volume on restricted programs that more than offset declines on mature production programs. DS posted sales growth of 5%, led by higher volume in the weapons and missile defense portfolio. Mission System sales were also up 5%, driven by higher restricted sales on advanced microelectronics programs and higher volume on marine systems programs. And our space business posted another quarter of double-digit top-line growth, with sales up approximately 14% for the year. Nearly 40% of the growth came from Sentinel and NGI, with the rest coming from our broad space portfolio. As Kathy described, our segment margins included a charge for the B-21 program. The charge was primarily driven by the confluence of lower assumptions around macroeconomic disruption funding and higher production cost projections. While the full pre-tax charge had the effect of lowering our segment margins, only $143 million has been recorded as an EAC adjustment, including a $43 million reduction to Q4 sales. The remaining was booked as a contingent liability because the majority of the lots have yet to be awarded. The charge also led to an $82 million benefit in corporate unallocated expense, stemming from a reduction in deferred state taxes. Continuing with our results, slide 5 shows a comparison of our 2023 earnings per share to the guidance we provided in October. Diluted EPS includes a $2.08 unfavorable mark-to-market adjustment from our pension plans and a $7.68 per share impact from the B-21 charge. Absent these items, we would have exceeded the high end of our prior EPS guidance range by over $0.40. Our 2023 mark-to-market adjusted EPS also included significantly less pension income compared to 2022. In total, net pension costs generated a $4.07 per share headwind in 2023. Next, I'll take a few moments to discuss our cash flows. As is our historical pattern, we had an outstanding quarter of cash performance in Q4, generating $1.6 billion in free cash flow. For the full year, our operating cash flow was $3.9 billion, and our free cash flow was $2.1 billion. This result was near the high end of our guidance range and represented free cash flow growth of 30% compared to 2022. Turning to pension results, we generated strong asset returns of roughly 11% in 2023, ahead of our long-term assumptions. The FAS discount rate declined by roughly 40 basis points to 5.15%. Netted together, along with updated census data, this generated a mark-to-market pension expense of $422 million in our GAAP results. Slide 7 in our earnings deck summarizes our pension estimates for the next three years. We continue to expect CAS recoveries to increase from current levels, providing a benefit to our cash flows, but slightly less than prior projections. And we expect a higher level of non-operating FAS pension income in the coming years, driven by our strong asset returns in 2023. In total, our funded status remains superb at nearly 100%, and we continue to project minimal cash pension contributions over the next several years. Turning to 2024, slide 9 in our earnings deck includes our segment-level guidance. Building off the strong top-line results in Q4, we now expect aeronautics sales in the low 11 billions, driven by growth on B-21 and on other programs such as F-35 and E-2D. This is higher than our prior sales estimates for AS, which reflected a flat 2023 and modest growth in 2024. Higher B-21 sales also result in a slightly lower margin rate expectation for AS, which we now project in the mid-9%, netting out to a similar volume of margin dollars compared to prior estimates. DS sales are expected to be roughly $6 billion, up low single digits from 2023. As we mentioned on the Q3 call, DS has really turned the corner on growth through strong demand for weapons and missile defense capabilities. We are optimistic in our ability to convert these opportunities into sustained growth in this business over time, which we expect to be partially offset by modest declines in the sustainment and training portions of the business. Margins are projected to remain strong at DS in the low 12% range. Mission System sales are expected in the low to mid $11 billion range for another year of mid-single digit growth, with margins of roughly 15%. And that space, after expanding sales at a greater than 17% CAGR since 2019, growth is expected to moderate in 2024 with higher segment margins. Space sales are now expected in the mid-to-high $14 billion range, with margins of approximately 9%. The mid-single digit growth rate in space reflects declines in a restricted program due to shifts in government priority, which are more than offset by growth in other parts of the space portfolio. Having built a tremendous backlog in recent years, space now has an opportunity to deliver strong ROI through more measured growth, along with margin expansion and cash generation. At the company level, our guidance reflects growth in sales and segment margin between 4% 5%, absent the B-21 charge, consistent with the outlook we provided on our October call, even after delivering top line upside in Q4. We expect another solid year of bookings, with a book-to-bill around one times. And similar to our cadence over the last few years, we expect sales to ramp throughout the year, with first quarter sales a little less than 24% of our full year estimate. We plan to be in the market soon for new debt issuance to take advantage of the favorable rate environment. The proceeds from the debt issuance will also be used in part to support refinancings of $1.5 billion of notes that are coming due in January of 2025, as well as for general corporate purposes and share repurchases, including the $1 billion ASR we intend to initiate in the coming days. We've reflected this debt issuance in our interest expense guidance, and we'd also expect interest income to contribute to the EPS line, as it did in 2023. We project an effective tax rate of approximately 17% in 2024, consistent with the range we've experienced over the last few years, excluding the mark-to-market adjustment and other unique items. We're coming closer to conclusions on a number of open audit and appeals processes with the IRS, which could have positive or negative effects on book and cash taxes as they're resolved over the next couple of years, and our forward guidance does not include any such adjustments. Similarly, we have not factored any potential changes to R&D tax legislation into our outlook. And as a reminder, our interpretation of current tax law results in a projected 5-year impact from R&D amortization of approximately $2 billion. We will continue to track these matters carefully and provide updates as they progress. In total, we expect our 2024 earnings per share to be between $24.45 and $24.85 on with approximately 148.5 million weighted shares outstanding. Moving to cash, we expect 2024 free cash flow between $2.25 billion and $2.65 billion consistent with our prior outlook. And as we've said before, capital expenditures are expected to remain elevated in 2024 before moderating in 2025 and beyond. Slide 11 in our earnings deck provides an update to our long-term free cash flow outlook to include 2026. We continue to expect our free cash flow to grow at a double-digit rate for several more years with additional growth in the second half of the decade. This expansion will be driven by sustained growth in our business, generating strong operating margin volume and converting those profits into cash. Meanwhile, lower cash taxes, higher CAS recoveries and lower levels of capital spending in the coming years provide additional structural levers to expand our cash flows at a rapid rate. Importantly, these ranges also include the latest estimated cash impacts associated with the B-21 charge. We expect roughly 60% of the charge to affect cash flows through 2026 with the remainder in the following years. Longer-term, we are confident we'll be able to continue to absorb the cash headwinds from B-21 while delivering excellent free cash flows in 2027 and beyond. In closing, I want to thank the entire Northrop Grumman team for their contributions to another great year. The strength of our portfolio and visibility of franchise programs provides us the opportunity to deliver and deploy robust cash flows as we execute on our strategy. And with that, let's open up the call to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you.[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\nKristine Liwag: Hey good morning, Kathy and Dave.\nKathy Warden: Good morning.\nKristine Liwag: Kathy, on the B-21, you've been very clear about the pressures on this program. Ultimately, how much relief did the customer extend to you to offset macro pressures and elevate [ph] portion. And is there still a possibility of future relief?\nKathy Warden: So Kristine, we've been working with the customer. And as we noted, the conversations continue. And last year, in 2023, we and Air Force disclosed that about $60 million of $1.5 billion that Congress appropriated for inflation was allocated to the advanced procurement for Lot 1 on this program. But we have yet to work through what that relief may be in future lots. We have, of course, as we said, updated our assumptions -- and through conversation and the tight budget environment, we've actually lowered the expectations for inflation relief. And so at this point, our focus is on executing this program and finding opportunities in the performance on the program while we continue to work with the government to see if there is any inflation relief opportunity.\nKristine Liwag: Great, thank you. And I\u2019ll keep it to one today. Thank you.\nKathy Warden: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Richard  Safran  (EPA:SAF) with Seaport Global. You may proceed.\nRichard Safran: Kathy, Dave good morning. So I know you're going to get a lot of questions on the B-21, but I thought I'd ask you about to expand on your opening remarks about Sentinel. I thought you might talk a bit more about the actions you're taking at the program back on track. How are you seeing risk on the program right now? And I guess, importantly, what you think the government's level support for the program is given all the headlines and what we've been seeing?\nKathy Warden: Yes. Thanks, Rich. So as the land-based leg of the nuclear triad, Sentinel is a top priority for the Department of Defense. The requirement for the program has been validated numerous times by multiple administrations, and we expect that to be the outcome of this latest review. As the Air Force is reported, the non-operating cost reach on the program is largely due to cost growth in the military construction and procurement segments of the program, and we and the industry team are currently executing on the cost plus EMD phase of the program. That's important because our design work in this phase is helping the Air Force to better estimate the costs of those later phases and due to a number of factors of learning their cost estimates for these later phases have increased, and that's what's driving the non-[indiscernible] breach as the Air Force has said, growth on the EMD would not have triggered the breach. I'll also note that their update captures the inflation since 2020, the last time they did a cost estimate. And we all know that there's been significantly higher inflation than what was assumed at that time. So some of that is what you're also seeing reflected in these latest cost estimates. I mean with that said, though, you asked about our performance on the program, and I'm really pleased to report on the progress that our team has made over the last 3 years while we've been executing on the EMD phase. We've on boarded thousands of engineers. We've matured the system design. We've produced and tested critical hardware in the missile system, as I've outlined earlier on the call. We've also engaged in risk reduction, which is helping to inform the Air Force launch facility modernization and we've done all this while also doing detailed planning for the future phase of the program. I myself have visited the missile fields actually, I was at one last Friday, which is part of why I've got this cold, I brought back. And I met with the Airmen [ph], who have committed themselves to this important mission. So we're all in. We know how important this is our team is partnering closely with the Air Force, and we're going to help them to deliver this essential capability for our nation.\nRichard Safran: Thanks for that. Feel better.\nKathy Warden: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. You may proceed.\nRonald Epstein: Hey good morning everyone. So maybe just jumping back to B-21. Charges like there's some programs have a tendency to accumulate over time. They don't tend to go the other way. How should we think about it as we go forward? I mean, this is what for the first 5 LRIPs, how many LRIPs could there be? And how do we think about the bounds on this? And then maybe one last thing. Is the program NPV positive and if it is, when does it actually become NPV positive, cash flow positive and so on and so forth. If you could just peel back the onion on the program.\nDavid Keffer: Sure. I can go ahead and get started with that. And see if we can address a number of questions you raised. First of all, in terms of the future, we'll continue to update our projections every quarter as we do with all of our large programs. But it's important to note, we have a lot more information today than we did at this time last year, having completed the production in the ground test phase of the first aircraft. We also have the majority of the suppliers now under contract with the remaining in advanced stages of negotiations. We have our latest estimates for productivity and reasonable learning curves that we believe are appropriate based on our historical experience. Of course, we now have one lot under contract, and we'll finalize quantities of the next four lots over time as well. In the economy and inflationary factors have stabilized a bit over the past year, and we'll continue to track those, of course, over time as well. But perhaps most importantly, we're still performing well on this program, which is continuing to provide a critical capability for our customers. In terms of the long-term NPV, we think that's the most important thing is that our customers will get great value from the aircraft. We'll deliver them over time, and that should, over time, also lead to value for the company and our shareholders.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Douglas Harned with Bernstein. You may proceed.\nDouglas Harned: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to go back to the Sentinel program. And when -- what you've described is that I think because that EMD is going well. But when you look at where this is headed and what came out with the Air Force commentary on the Nunn-McCurdy breach. A couple of things that I wanted to understand better. They're talking about potentially a 2-year delay in IOC, they're also -- also you talked about it a little bit, but to understand how much of this breach is due to potential changes in requirements and things that are, in a sense, under your purview versus those that may be under others, including the government customer?\nKathy Warden: Yes. So as you note, there is a delay to IOC, the reason though for the Nunn-McCurdy breach is the cost growth. So oftentimes scheduled delays add costs to the program, that is not the primary contributor. It is, as you noted, design decisions, particularly related to the command and launch requirements that the Air Force has and that affects the deployment in the launch facilities in each of the silos. And so that is what we are working to inform the Air Force decision process on alternatives and ways to reduce those costs and procurement and yet those are Air Force cost estimates, and they include a significant amount of scope that is outside of the industry team's execution. But nonetheless, we will help to inform those discussions if they're ongoing during this review process.\nDouglas Harned: And does the delay in the timing, does this have much effect right now on your outlook for the overall profitability of the program.\nKathy Warden: It does not, Doug, our near-term assumptions on both the ramp of the program relative to sales as well as the profitability of the program are not materially impacted.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. You may proceed.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning everyone. Thank you. Kathy or Dave, maybe if you could just talk about the free cash flow guidance that you're sticking with the 15% CAGR. Just the drivers in terms of top line working capital, Section 174, and the impact of B-21, Dave, I think you said 60% of that over $600 million is through 2026. Is that right? And do we think about Sentinel as a positive cash contributor?\nDavid Keffer: Sure. Thanks for the question, Sheila. I'm happy to dig into that. The strength of the free cash flow outlook we really think of as one of the highlights our report today. And so happy to dig into that in more detail. And I think you heard correctly that 60% of the charge is associated with the period through 2026 from a cash flow perspective. I think importantly, the strength of the broad base of other programs across the business is serving to offset those pressures. And that's what we're seeing in our ability to maintain and build confidence in our multiyear outlook including adding a strong 2026 year to that outlook that continues the double-digit growth trajectory that we expect for the next several years. We had a great finish to 2023 for free cash flow, really strong working capital performance, and that is enabling us to build confidence in our ability to continue to perform at similar levels going forward. As a company, we've put a lot of focus on working capital efficiency, on capital efficiency, on driving cash returns on recent investments and that is clearly showing up in the results and the performance of all of our sectors. We're proud of their performance on cash in Q4 and in the outlooks for 2024 and beyond. And the net effect of all of these factors is that unchanged free cash flow outlook for 2024 and 2025, along with a strong 2026. I'd highlight in terms of what drives that going forward? What's the underlying force as you point out? Certainly, the operations of the business growth in the top line is, first and foremost, with an opportunity for growth at the margin rate line as well that leads to really strong margin dollar volume, which will convert into cash through the strong working capital performance that we expect to continue which is essentially a stable assumption in our outlook. We're not looking for significant additional efficiencies given just how strong we were at the end of 2023. And then as we noted earlier, there are other structural factors that should help as well with CAS pension reimbursement growing slightly over the next few years and cash tax is projected to decline over that same period. So essentially, all of those factors will lead to strong -- strong free cash flow growth outlook for the next several years and beyond.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\nSeth Seifman: Thanks very much. And good morning. I guess a 2-part question about B-21. First was the $143 million EAC in the quarter, is that the extent of the entire anticipated loss on lot 1 and I guess, how do we think about the progression of losses on the various lots? And then second, the fact that this charge includes lots that will be in budgets in 2026 and 2027 and not come under contract for a while and not be worked on for a while. I guess how would you assess the opportunity to maybe ultimately do a little bit better than anticipated here.\nDavid Keffer: Sure. I can start on that, Seth. I think you've read properly into the $143 million EAC adjustment with Lot 1 having been awarded and the other is not yet awarded, that one does take the form of an EAC adjustment. So that $143 million is the lot 1 amount we are currently projecting. And the future progression while we can't get into much detail because that would involve a lot sizes and quantities and other classified details. Clearly, the implication is that there's modest growth from lot 1 to future lots on average. Over time, I think you're thinking of this the right way that our current projections would indicate an average of a couple of hundred million dollars a year of after-tax impact on our -- on the cash line from B-21, and that's, as I referred to a few minutes ago, the headwind we've been able to mitigate through strength in the rest of the business. In terms of your point about opportunity to outperform that over the long-term. Clearly, it is a core focus of our team to continue to drive efficiencies in the learning curves, successful outcomes of our negotiations with suppliers. We continue to engage and partner with our customer to understand macroeconomic impacts on the program and address opportunities for funding of relief, as Kathy mentioned earlier. And so we'll continue to address all of those opportunities. This is something we'll update you in the rest of the Street on over time.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with TD Cowen. You may proceed.\nCai Von Rumohr: Thanks so much. Kathy best wishes to feel better.\nKathy Warden: It sounds like you need those wishes as well.\nCai Von Rumohr: So anyway, so you had the loss on the B-21 kind of it didn't look like a loss couple of quarters ago. You've had your second loss on Halo. This is clearly proving to be an environment where on fixed price contract, there is more risk. Have you changed your strategy regarding how you bid and specifically with reference to Tranche 2 of the tracking satellites because you were on Tranche 1 and you were not on Tranche 2. So have you changed your strategy in terms of how you're bidding? And are there any contracts that you bid before changing your strategy that would still have risk that we're not aware of today?\nKathy Warden: Very insightful question as always, Cai. So when you look back to 2015, when we did B-21, we certainly have changed our view on bidding of contracts where did not have a mature design. It's a point of bid and yet we committed to fixed price options into the future. And we have, to my knowledge, not done that again. And we have passed on some high-profile programs as a result of the risk balance that the customer put forward in the RFP not meeting our standards. We have programs like Halo, which we have certainly learned some additional lessons and are applying those as we move forward. And you note on some very recent bids, we have taken a different approach in looking at firm fixed price, where we've either declined a bit if the customer chose to go fixed price or we've offered a price -- in the case of SDA Tranche 2 that we thought was fair and reasonable and the customer decided not to further negotiate with us. These are things that are going to happen and we're going to remain disciplined. We have plenty of opportunity in this company to grow. We have a strong pipeline of opportunities we're pursuing. And a strong pipeline of opportunities that we believe have the right risk/reward balance with industry.\nCai Von Rumohr: Thanks so much. Feel better.\nKathy Warden: Thank you too.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Gavin Parsons (NYSE:PSN) with UBS. You may proceed.\nGavin Parsons: Thanks, good morning.\nKathy Warden: Good morning.\nGavin Parsons: Maybe just following on Ron's question. Does the B-21 charge contemplate current conditions as they are? Does it have some consideration for future uncertainty in macro or supply chain?\nKathy Warden: With all of our EACs, B-21 included, we do our best based on what we know today to project conditions out into the future. Now with that said, that's difficult to do longer-term that period of performance is. So in this case, we're looking out over greater than 5 years. So as we get into those out years, that's a bit more speculative, but we do incorporate our expectations for changes in everything from material labor pricing to productivity and learning.\nGavin Parsons: Okay. Understood. And Dave, you mentioned the IRS appeal process. Any way to put a range around the possible cash impact on that?\nDavid Keffer: No, I'd refer you to our tax disclosures for more than enough detail on all of those fronts. It's tough to put a range around those things. We're looking forward to getting through processes, as you know, from those disclosures, we have a lot of open years that have yet to be resolved and looking forward to working with the IRS to come to reasonable resolutions there, and we'll update you on any book or tax differences from current reserves as we get there.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.\nScott Deuschle: Hey good morning.\nKathy Warden: Good morning.\nScott Deuschle: Dave, can you give us a sense for the proportion of supplier costs across the 5 LRIP lots that have now been fixed versus what's still open to negotiation?\nDavid Keffer: Sure. As we noted a few moments ago, we're now at a majority of the supplier costs that have been fully negotiated across the LRIP phase. And we're in various stages of negotiation with suppliers for the remainder. So that's one area where we have learn more and progressed in our process compared to where we were a year ago or even a quarter ago.\nScott Deuschle: Okay. Great. And then just as a follow-up, where does the commercial inventory come from in the space business? And is that EBIT headwind mostly gone now? Or is there any more of that left to come in 2024? Thank you.\nDavid Keffer: Sure. Thanks for the question. We had offsetting effects in 2024 and 2023, rather, including Q4 in the commercial elements of the space business. As you know, those are much smaller than and kind of tangential to the core national security space business that we have. In the case of those commercial inventory write-downs, those were related to newer investments in product lines to address burgeoning market opportunity in both the government and commercial elements of the space market. We did see some modest write-downs in various quarters in 2023 associated with those. Those are the types of things you occasionally go through as you make such new investments. So again, not core to the current or future growth story of the space business.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.\nKenneth Herbert: Yes, thank you good morning. Maybe, Kathy, at a high level, I wanted to follow up on your comments earlier regarding sort of the key margin drivers you outlined last year. Specifically more on the cost and productivity efforts and maybe on the mix side, are you seeing incrementally more opportunity now as we think about 2024? And how should we think about sort of the absolute opportunity on those now into this year versus perhaps how much more of a benefit we see in 2025 and beyond.\nKathy Warden: Thanks, Ken. We laid out 3 drivers, the first of which being stabilization in macroeconomics, and we are certainly seeing that in 2024, which is why we see our margin rates this year in line with last with some opportunity for improvement as we go throughout the year. We layer on top of that cost and productivity actions that we are taking in the company, and that will provide some tailwinds in 2024 growing tailwinds into 2025. And the mix shift really is a bit of a longer-term proposition for us. We've talked about that being a shift from cost type to fixed price, where we expect 2023 was really our high watermark for cost type, but a very gradual shift in that mix to fixed price with more of it coming in the latter half of this decade. And then international mix is the other where we don't expect significant international growth in 2024, but we do expect that to step up based on our pipeline and particularly the strong weapons demand outside the U.S. in 2025. That gives you a sense of what will be a tailwind to margin rate win.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.\nMyles Walton: Thanks, good morning. I was wondering, Dave, or Kathy, you previously talked about a $4 billion free cash flow target in 2028, effectively doubling what you've done in 2023. I just want to make sure that's still on the table, despite the charge absorption in that period of time? And then maybe, Kathy, on the margin expansion specific to Aerospace, is that still a 10% margin business? Or do we have to glide slope down a little bit further into 2025, 2026.\nDavid Keffer: Thanks for the question, Myles. Let me kick off with the 2023 free cash flow number. I appreciate the question on that because I think that too is core to the outlook going forward. Yes, we are reaffirming that $4 billion target for 2028. And essentially doubling the level that we were projecting at the midpoint of our 2023 guidance, which was $2 billion. Of course, we exceeded that by $100 million in our final result for 2023. The drivers of that growth are much of what we've talked about already. Certainly, growth in the top line. As Kathy just noted, some of the drivers of margin rate expansion opportunity which leads to margin dollars having an opportunity to exceed the growth rate of our top line through 2028. And importantly, CapEx will moderate during that same period. So we've noted that 2023 and 2024 of these peak years of capital intensity that continues to be our outlook with declines in 2025 and beyond. And then pension and tax will serve as tailwinds during that same period. So that leads you to the $4 billion number. And I think if you look at the 2024 and 2025 numbers we've reiterated for our free cash outlook today and add in that 2026 range, you'll get to that same glide slope that would push you upward toward the $4 billion number by 2028. So those are the building blocks and the way we plan to get there.\nKathy Warden: And Myles, on AS margins, what we're seeing, as Dave noted earlier is that with the B-21 growth being a bit stronger than we had anticipated, AS is stepping up on top line. It is putting some pressure on margin rate, but margin dollars are exactly where we had anticipated they would be coming into 2024, and our guide therefore, remained consistent for AS on a dollar basis, even though we now are looking at more of a mid-9s rate projection. As you go out over time, it's less dependent on what happens with absorbing that lower rate on B-21 and more what happens in terms of other new programs coming into the AS portfolio and the rate at which we will book those programs. So we'll provide you more insight into that over the coming year as we look towards 2025 and beyond.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. You may proceed.\nRobert Spingarn: Hey good morning. Kathy, a few minutes ago, you alluded to international and I wanted to bring up IBCS because it's had some strong demand signals from international customers and thought maybe you could dig into that program a little bit, give us a sense of how large it is in revenue or how -- in 2023 or 2024? And how big it might be, let's say, 5 years from now?\nKathy Warden: It certainly is an area of strength in our portfolio. We've seen strong performance by the team on the U.S. Army program and also as we are deploying in Poland, and we see follow-on opportunities in Poland as a result. We've also, as I\u2019ve spoken about throughout the course of 2023, added a number of additional countries who have expressed interest in the program to the pipeline, and that's what would drive the growth that we anticipate in the 2025 time frame. As you noted, I mentioned international demand. Part of that is weapons part of that is the IBCS portfolio. And then, of course, we have some aircraft and mission system strength in the pipeline for international in 2025 as well. The program itself is growing at a fairly rapid rate, but off of a relatively small it's about $400 million of annual sales. And we expect that to grow, of course, but not a major contributor is the enterprise line for growth.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. You may proceed.\nGeorge Shapiro: Good morning. Kathy, I wanted to ask on the charge for the B-21, what caused it to be bigger than the 0 to $1.2 billion range that you've kind of been reiterating since last year? And then just specifically, maybe the margin that you had said would be around 10% is now maybe 9.5%. I know you alluded to a few minutes ago, the B-21 was growing faster. But it\u2019s got to grow a lot faster to drop the margin by 50 basis points. So I was just wondering if you could explore that a little bit more. Thanks very much.\nKathy Warden: Let me start with the first part of your question and Dave will cover the second. As we noted, we identified this risk last year, and we, throughout the year, revisited it on a quarterly basis. There were 2 primary changes in the fourth quarter that both led us to deem it probable loss as well as impacted the value of that loss. First, we significantly reduced our projections for funding related to macroeconomic impacts, as we've talked about a couple of times already. Although we continue to partner with the government to address these impacts. We believe it's prudent in light of the current budget status to reduce those assumptions. And so we did that. The second is we've experienced growth in our cost projection, both in the internal production costs as we've continued to build aircraft as Dave talked about through our negotiations with suppliers. We have learned and built that learning into the forward-looking estimates that we now have in the EAC, so those were the factors. As we've talked about, we did a very detailed look at this EAC in the fourth quarter and had matured and had actual data to reflect on that we did not have at an earlier point.\nDavid Keffer: Let me follow up on the second part of your question because I do think it's an important nuance. The AS business was operating in the mid-10 billions in scale over the past year, it exceeded our original expectations in sales in 2023 and now is projected to exceed them even more significantly compared to where they were a year ago in 2024. We were talking about a flat 2023 and very modest growth in 2024 based off of that mid-tens level. And now we're all the way up into the low 11s. And so that low 11s at a mid-9% margin rate is the same as the mid-to-high 10s at a slightly higher margin rate. We're really focused on driving the dollar volume of operating margin in our Aeronautics business and across our business, it's that return on invested capital, the growth in margin dollars and in free cash flow that results from it, that is really our core focus.\nTodd Ernst: Josh, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our final question. Our final question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi. You may proceed.\nJason Gursky: Hey good morning everybody. Dave, just a clarification question for you to start. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that there were some shifting priorities from the government and the space business that was leading to a deceleration in growth. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on what those shifting priorities might be? And then Kathy, I just wanted to provide you maybe a bit of an open-ended question to kind of wrap all this together here. Just broadly talk about all the risks and opportunities that you see in front of you on the execution side of things. You've obviously got record backlog here and we know about the B-21 risk. But I'm wondering if you could just maybe highlight and wrap this all together, do we have a balanced risk and opportunities portfolio here, we a little bit more overweight risk than we are opportunity? And maybe just kind of dive into a little bit of the details of what you're seeing and maybe what you're all doing to address those issues. Thanks.\nDavid Keffer: Sure. Great questions, Jason. Let me go ahead and start with your original question on the national security space portfolio. As we mentioned, our guidance captures growth and declines in various programs across all of our portfolios, very much including space. In the case of space, as we've noted, there are some shifts in budget priorities. A lot of our customers are having to address budget prioritization, particularly as it relates to 2025 and beyond. With that said, in this particular case, given that it's in the restricted domain, there's not much more we can say about the mission or the program or anything like that. What's important there is that our space sector, and therefore, company guidance accounts for our latest understanding of all the programs in that portfolio and the likely path forward for them. And I think when you look at the space guidance, you see a lot of value creation as they continue to grow the top line. And in this case, now grow margin rates alongside that with lower capital intensity starting in 2025, in particular, you see a lot of improvement in returns on invested capital in the space business, given how much growth they've built in their foundation over the last few years.\nJason Gursky: Kathy?\nKathy Warden: And Jason, I really appreciate the question. I wish I had another hour to discuss it with you, but being respectful of everybody's time, let me just simply say that I see our portfolio and the set of opportunities and risks we have as balanced and consistent with what I have seen in recent years since I stepped into this role. We have a team who has stepped up and provided top line growth, which I believe is industry leading at about 5% on a compound annual basis each of the last four years. We're projecting that again this year. We see the opportunity space is rich, both domestically and internationally. And to the risks that we have in executing this portfolio, while the pandemic certainly made that more challenging for the last couple of years. We're turning the corner. Our overall program performance has not been stronger since I've been at the company, and that's 15 years and going. So I really feel good about how this team is positioned. We now have fully disclosed and taken into the P&L the B-21 risk, which we've been talking about and feel confident that we can now go execute this program. And I am proud of what the team collectively has accomplished across 2023 and look forward to the outlook we have in place for 2024. So with that, I just want to again thank my colleagues at Northrop Grumman for their dedication, both to our country and our company. I also want to thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in April. So Josh, that concludes the call. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Welcome to Northrop Grumman's Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2023 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. My name is Josh, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.\nTodd Ernst: Thanks, Josh. Good morning and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Fourth Quarter 2023 Conference Call. This morning, we'll refer to a presentation that is posted to our IR website. Before we get started, matters discussed on today's call, including guidance and outlooks for 2024 and beyond reflect the company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including those noted in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially. Today's call will include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release. And on the call today are Kathy Warden, our Chair, CEO and President; and Dave Keffer, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?\nKathy Warden: Thanks Todd. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Before discussing our 2023 results, I wanted to take a moment to thank our team for their hard work and dedication to our important mission. Our talented workforce which is now over a 100,000 strong continues to deliver some of the most advanced technologies in the world. These capabilities are used by our customer\u2019s everyday to defend freedom and deter aggression around the globe. The geopolitical landscape has grown even more complex driving continued increases in global security spending. Our strategies has positioned us well to compete and win in this growing market which has translated into accelerating topline growth for Northrop Grumman. Revenue increased by over 7% in 2023 [indiscernible] more than a billion above the midpoint of our original 2023 guidance. In addition, our book-to-bill for the year was 1.14 times, that\u2019s in line with our exceptional four year average. As a result of this award strength, we achieved a new record backlog which now exceeds $84 billion and now provides a healthy foundation for our continued growth. The underlying performance of our company is strong. We generated free cash flow at the high end of our guidance range, and we comfortably exceeded our sales and EPS guidance range, absence of B-21 charge. While we're disappointed that our assessment of conditions for the low rate initial production portion of the B-21 program necessitated this charge in the quarter, we are confident in our ability to deliver on the company's forward outlook, which remains unchanged. We're also proud of the performance of the B-21 team, which continues to execute an unparalleled aircraft development program. As we look forward, we will continue to execute our business strategy, which at its core is based on technology differentiation, a laser focus on performance, and value delivery for our customers and shareholders. To support this strategy, we are prioritizing investment in our capacity and capabilities. In 2023, we invested over $2.9 billion in R&D and CapEx, that's 7.5% of sales, to continue driving innovation and capacity to support our customer mission success. We also delivered over $2.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, representing a return of approximately 125% of our 2023 free cash flow. So now I'll highlight a few examples of progress we've made across the portfolio that further bolster my confidence in our future. Shortly after the close of the fourth quarter, we announced our GEM 63XL solid rocket boosters helped to successfully power ULA\u2019s Vulcan launch vehicle on its first mission. Future Vulcan missions will utilize additional GEM 63XLs in support of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Kuiper, and other ULA customers, providing a significant growth opportunity for our propulsion business. And this is an important milestone because it supports our investment to significantly ramp production capacity of GEM 63s in the coming years. Global demand for our weapons system increased in 2023, and we expect this trend to continue. In this market, we're both a supplier and a prime. We're a supplier of propulsion systems, warheads, fuses, and cannons across a highly diversified customer base, and a prime contractor for predominantly air-to-ground missiles, including AARGM, AARGM-ER, and Stand-in Attack Weapon. Weapons systems currently represents approximately 7% of total revenue, and based on the demands we're seeing, we expect this business to grow faster than the company average for the foreseeable future, with a significant portion of this expansion coming from international customers. In our Mission Systems business, demand remains exceptionally strong, with a 2023 book-to-bill above 1.2 times, the highest of all of our segments. As we've seen in recent years, the restricted portfolio of Mission Systems is a meaningful driver of growth as our customers pursue solutions that enable them to operate inside the decision loop of potential adversaries who are also advancing their computing capabilities. We are helping our customers stay ahead by developing advanced microelectronics, sensors, processors, and secure communication. Our product lines are enabling faster cycles of modernization, positioning our customers with decision advantage in this rapidly advancing technology environment. And we continue to make significant progress on the EMD phase of Sentinel, which is the next generation land-based leg of the strategic triad. We are achieving milestones to mature the design and reduce risk, including key test activities, such as the successful static fire test of the Sentinel Stage 2 solid rocket motor for the missile earlier this month. Last week, the Air Force submitted to Congress a new set of cost estimates for the program, which triggered a Nunn-McCurdy Breach. This in turn launches a review of the program by the Department of Defense, which we expect to be ongoing for the next several months. It's important to note that the cost growth is primarily driven by estimates for the command and launch facility build-out, which is part of the military construction and procurement phases of the program. We and our industry team are continuing to perform on the EMD phase in close partnership with the U.S. Air Force. And we'll work with the government to explore opportunities to reduce costs on the program with a focus on the late 2020s and beyond when the program is expected to move into the procurement phase. And in the fourth quarter, the B-21 entered its flight test phase. This is a major milestone for the program and achieving it within the baseline schedule is a credit to the Northrop Grumman team and our close partnership with the U.S. Air Force over the past several years. Following this milestone, we were awarded the first LRIP lot in the fourth quarter and production is now underway. Let me take a few moments to provide a little more detail on the B-21 charge. The possibility of which we started talking with you about at this time last year. As you know, like all of industry, we and our suppliers have experienced cost pressure from recent global macroeconomic conditions, which are significantly different from the assumptions the team made when bidding these five production lots in 2015. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we again reviewed our estimated profitability on the LRIP phase of the program. And we now believe it is probable each of the first five LRIP lots will be performed at a loss. The charge is largely driven by a change in our assumptions regarding funding to mitigate the impact of macroeconomic disruptions on the LRIP phase of the program and higher projected manufacturing costs that reflect recent supplier negotiations and our experience in completing the first aircraft. The after tax cash impact related to these updates will be spread over a number of years. Importantly, we have absorbed this effect and we have not changed our outlook for free cash flow growth over the next several years. This is a game changing capability that will be of great value to our nation. And we are focused on executing the program in a way that also delivers value to our shareholders over the coming decades. Turning now to the budget environment. Global national security spending is increasing as the U.S. and allies invest in capabilities to deter and defend against aggression. Demand for our capabilities remain strong due to our differentiated portfolio and alignment to customer priorities including the triad, space and weapons. In the U.S., our franchise programs remain well supported by Congress and the Department of Defense. And this gives us confidence in our outlook even in a constrained U.S. budget environment. We are pleased to have an NDAA in place that provides continued support for defense spending. And we're hopeful that Congress will enact appropriations soon. Our guidance assumes we will not have a shutdown or a full year CR, and we're encouraged by the progress we've seen so far towards passing appropriations in the March timeframe. Additionally, we are monitoring progress on supplemental funding and we see opportunities in expanding the industrial base and increasing munitions production in this pending request. Our allies are also increasing their defense spending and we expect our alignment with their needs for aircraft, weapon systems and mission systems to be an additional source of growth. So as we look to the future, we have the right portfolio and team to deliver on our long-term outlook. Our organic sales have grown at a greater than 5% annual rate since 2019. And our guidance calls for continued growth of 4% to 5% in 2024. Segment operating margin dollars are expected to grow at roughly the same rate as sales in 2024. And our 2024 EPS guidance range of $24.45 to $24.85 at the midpoint represents roughly 6% growth excluding the B-21 charge and 11% growth compared to our initial EPS estimates which we provided for in 2023. In addition, the structural building blocks to expand our margins that we outlined in last year's 2Q earnings call, including dissipating macroeconomic headwinds, implementation of productivity and cost savings initiatives and future favorable mix shift remain in place. We are laser focused on performance and bid discipline to drive margin expansion. And importantly, we continue to expect our free cash flow to grow at a double digit rate over the coming years. We are reaffirming our 2024 and 2025 free cash flow outlook. And we've also introduced a 2026 outlook of $3.3 billion at the midpoint. With the businesses generating significant cash flow, we have considerable flexibility in deploying capital to generate value for customers and shareholders. Our top priority remains investing to support our business strategy. And we expect to invest over 7% of sales again in 2024 in capital expenditures and R&D. At the same time, we'll continue to provide strong capital returns to our shareholders. Last month, our board of directors increased our share repurchase authorization by an additional $2.5 billion, and we ended the year with a remaining authorization of $3.6 billion. For 2024, we expect to increase our share repurchases to at least $2 billion. This includes a $1 billion ASR that we plan to initiate in the coming days based on the strong liquidity position with which we entered this year. So when we take these factors, sustainable top-line growth with expanding margins, and couple those with declining capital intensity and lower projected cash taxes, you get a recipe for robust cash flow growth for years to come. So now I'll turn it over to Dave to provide you more details on the segment results, 2024 guidance, and the forward outlook. Dave?\nDave Keffer: Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. We finished the year with strong momentum, enabling us to reaffirm and build upon our favorable forward outlook. I'll start by elaborating on our 2023 results and then provide additional details on our guidance. On the demand side, we ended 2023 with over $84 billion in backlog, a new record for our company. All four of our segments generated a full-year book-to-bill ratio over one-time sales. We also continued to deliver strong top-line results with Q4 sales of $10.6 billion, up 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Full-year sales were even stronger, up over 7% at $39.3 billion, or roughly $300 million higher than our latest guidance. These top-line results were enabled not only by the strong demand environment we're seeing among our customers, but also by our ability to ramp on new programs, expand our workforce, and convert our backlog into sales. Moving to segment results, we generated sales growth in each of our businesses in 2023. Aeronautics sales were up 2% for the year, returning to growth earlier than previously expected. AS growth was driven by higher volume on restricted programs that more than offset declines on mature production programs. DS posted sales growth of 5%, led by higher volume in the weapons and missile defense portfolio. Mission System sales were also up 5%, driven by higher restricted sales on advanced microelectronics programs and higher volume on marine systems programs. And our space business posted another quarter of double-digit top-line growth, with sales up approximately 14% for the year. Nearly 40% of the growth came from Sentinel and NGI, with the rest coming from our broad space portfolio. As Kathy described, our segment margins included a charge for the B-21 program. The charge was primarily driven by the confluence of lower assumptions around macroeconomic disruption funding and higher production cost projections. While the full pre-tax charge had the effect of lowering our segment margins, only $143 million has been recorded as an EAC adjustment, including a $43 million reduction to Q4 sales. The remaining was booked as a contingent liability because the majority of the lots have yet to be awarded. The charge also led to an $82 million benefit in corporate unallocated expense, stemming from a reduction in deferred state taxes. Continuing with our results, slide 5 shows a comparison of our 2023 earnings per share to the guidance we provided in October. Diluted EPS includes a $2.08 unfavorable mark-to-market adjustment from our pension plans and a $7.68 per share impact from the B-21 charge. Absent these items, we would have exceeded the high end of our prior EPS guidance range by over $0.40. Our 2023 mark-to-market adjusted EPS also included significantly less pension income compared to 2022. In total, net pension costs generated a $4.07 per share headwind in 2023. Next, I'll take a few moments to discuss our cash flows. As is our historical pattern, we had an outstanding quarter of cash performance in Q4, generating $1.6 billion in free cash flow. For the full year, our operating cash flow was $3.9 billion, and our free cash flow was $2.1 billion. This result was near the high end of our guidance range and represented free cash flow growth of 30% compared to 2022. Turning to pension results, we generated strong asset returns of roughly 11% in 2023, ahead of our long-term assumptions. The FAS discount rate declined by roughly 40 basis points to 5.15%. Netted together, along with updated census data, this generated a mark-to-market pension expense of $422 million in our GAAP results. Slide 7 in our earnings deck summarizes our pension estimates for the next three years. We continue to expect CAS recoveries to increase from current levels, providing a benefit to our cash flows, but slightly less than prior projections. And we expect a higher level of non-operating FAS pension income in the coming years, driven by our strong asset returns in 2023. In total, our funded status remains superb at nearly 100%, and we continue to project minimal cash pension contributions over the next several years. Turning to 2024, slide 9 in our earnings deck includes our segment-level guidance. Building off the strong top-line results in Q4, we now expect aeronautics sales in the low 11 billions, driven by growth on B-21 and on other programs such as F-35 and E-2D. This is higher than our prior sales estimates for AS, which reflected a flat 2023 and modest growth in 2024. Higher B-21 sales also result in a slightly lower margin rate expectation for AS, which we now project in the mid-9%, netting out to a similar volume of margin dollars compared to prior estimates. DS sales are expected to be roughly $6 billion, up low single digits from 2023. As we mentioned on the Q3 call, DS has really turned the corner on growth through strong demand for weapons and missile defense capabilities. We are optimistic in our ability to convert these opportunities into sustained growth in this business over time, which we expect to be partially offset by modest declines in the sustainment and training portions of the business. Margins are projected to remain strong at DS in the low 12% range. Mission System sales are expected in the low to mid $11 billion range for another year of mid-single digit growth, with margins of roughly 15%. And that space, after expanding sales at a greater than 17% CAGR since 2019, growth is expected to moderate in 2024 with higher segment margins. Space sales are now expected in the mid-to-high $14 billion range, with margins of approximately 9%. The mid-single digit growth rate in space reflects declines in a restricted program due to shifts in government priority, which are more than offset by growth in other parts of the space portfolio. Having built a tremendous backlog in recent years, space now has an opportunity to deliver strong ROI through more measured growth, along with margin expansion and cash generation. At the company level, our guidance reflects growth in sales and segment margin between 4% 5%, absent the B-21 charge, consistent with the outlook we provided on our October call, even after delivering top line upside in Q4. We expect another solid year of bookings, with a book-to-bill around one times. And similar to our cadence over the last few years, we expect sales to ramp throughout the year, with first quarter sales a little less than 24% of our full year estimate. We plan to be in the market soon for new debt issuance to take advantage of the favorable rate environment. The proceeds from the debt issuance will also be used in part to support refinancings of $1.5 billion of notes that are coming due in January of 2025, as well as for general corporate purposes and share repurchases, including the $1 billion ASR we intend to initiate in the coming days. We've reflected this debt issuance in our interest expense guidance, and we'd also expect interest income to contribute to the EPS line, as it did in 2023. We project an effective tax rate of approximately 17% in 2024, consistent with the range we've experienced over the last few years, excluding the mark-to-market adjustment and other unique items. We're coming closer to conclusions on a number of open audit and appeals processes with the IRS, which could have positive or negative effects on book and cash taxes as they're resolved over the next couple of years, and our forward guidance does not include any such adjustments. Similarly, we have not factored any potential changes to R&D tax legislation into our outlook. And as a reminder, our interpretation of current tax law results in a projected 5-year impact from R&D amortization of approximately $2 billion. We will continue to track these matters carefully and provide updates as they progress. In total, we expect our 2024 earnings per share to be between $24.45 and $24.85 on with approximately 148.5 million weighted shares outstanding. Moving to cash, we expect 2024 free cash flow between $2.25 billion and $2.65 billion consistent with our prior outlook. And as we've said before, capital expenditures are expected to remain elevated in 2024 before moderating in 2025 and beyond. Slide 11 in our earnings deck provides an update to our long-term free cash flow outlook to include 2026. We continue to expect our free cash flow to grow at a double-digit rate for several more years with additional growth in the second half of the decade. This expansion will be driven by sustained growth in our business, generating strong operating margin volume and converting those profits into cash. Meanwhile, lower cash taxes, higher CAS recoveries and lower levels of capital spending in the coming years provide additional structural levers to expand our cash flows at a rapid rate. Importantly, these ranges also include the latest estimated cash impacts associated with the B-21 charge. We expect roughly 60% of the charge to affect cash flows through 2026 with the remainder in the following years. Longer-term, we are confident we'll be able to continue to absorb the cash headwinds from B-21 while delivering excellent free cash flows in 2027 and beyond. In closing, I want to thank the entire Northrop Grumman team for their contributions to another great year. The strength of our portfolio and visibility of franchise programs provides us the opportunity to deliver and deploy robust cash flows as we execute on our strategy. And with that, let's open up the call to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you.[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\nKristine Liwag: Hey good morning, Kathy and Dave.\nKathy Warden: Good morning.\nKristine Liwag: Kathy, on the B-21, you've been very clear about the pressures on this program. Ultimately, how much relief did the customer extend to you to offset macro pressures and elevate [ph] portion. And is there still a possibility of future relief?\nKathy Warden: So Kristine, we've been working with the customer. And as we noted, the conversations continue. And last year, in 2023, we and Air Force disclosed that about $60 million of $1.5 billion that Congress appropriated for inflation was allocated to the advanced procurement for Lot 1 on this program. But we have yet to work through what that relief may be in future lots. We have, of course, as we said, updated our assumptions -- and through conversation and the tight budget environment, we've actually lowered the expectations for inflation relief. And so at this point, our focus is on executing this program and finding opportunities in the performance on the program while we continue to work with the government to see if there is any inflation relief opportunity.\nKristine Liwag: Great, thank you. And I\u2019ll keep it to one today. Thank you.\nKathy Warden: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Richard  Safran  (EPA:SAF) with Seaport Global. You may proceed.\nRichard Safran: Kathy, Dave good morning. So I know you're going to get a lot of questions on the B-21, but I thought I'd ask you about to expand on your opening remarks about Sentinel. I thought you might talk a bit more about the actions you're taking at the program back on track. How are you seeing risk on the program right now? And I guess, importantly, what you think the government's level support for the program is given all the headlines and what we've been seeing?\nKathy Warden: Yes. Thanks, Rich. So as the land-based leg of the nuclear triad, Sentinel is a top priority for the Department of Defense. The requirement for the program has been validated numerous times by multiple administrations, and we expect that to be the outcome of this latest review. As the Air Force is reported, the non-operating cost reach on the program is largely due to cost growth in the military construction and procurement segments of the program, and we and the industry team are currently executing on the cost plus EMD phase of the program. That's important because our design work in this phase is helping the Air Force to better estimate the costs of those later phases and due to a number of factors of learning their cost estimates for these later phases have increased, and that's what's driving the non-[indiscernible] breach as the Air Force has said, growth on the EMD would not have triggered the breach. I'll also note that their update captures the inflation since 2020, the last time they did a cost estimate. And we all know that there's been significantly higher inflation than what was assumed at that time. So some of that is what you're also seeing reflected in these latest cost estimates. I mean with that said, though, you asked about our performance on the program, and I'm really pleased to report on the progress that our team has made over the last 3 years while we've been executing on the EMD phase. We've on boarded thousands of engineers. We've matured the system design. We've produced and tested critical hardware in the missile system, as I've outlined earlier on the call. We've also engaged in risk reduction, which is helping to inform the Air Force launch facility modernization and we've done all this while also doing detailed planning for the future phase of the program. I myself have visited the missile fields actually, I was at one last Friday, which is part of why I've got this cold, I brought back. And I met with the Airmen [ph], who have committed themselves to this important mission. So we're all in. We know how important this is our team is partnering closely with the Air Force, and we're going to help them to deliver this essential capability for our nation.\nRichard Safran: Thanks for that. Feel better.\nKathy Warden: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. You may proceed.\nRonald Epstein: Hey good morning everyone. So maybe just jumping back to B-21. Charges like there's some programs have a tendency to accumulate over time. They don't tend to go the other way. How should we think about it as we go forward? I mean, this is what for the first 5 LRIPs, how many LRIPs could there be? And how do we think about the bounds on this? And then maybe one last thing. Is the program NPV positive and if it is, when does it actually become NPV positive, cash flow positive and so on and so forth. If you could just peel back the onion on the program.\nDavid Keffer: Sure. I can go ahead and get started with that. And see if we can address a number of questions you raised. First of all, in terms of the future, we'll continue to update our projections every quarter as we do with all of our large programs. But it's important to note, we have a lot more information today than we did at this time last year, having completed the production in the ground test phase of the first aircraft. We also have the majority of the suppliers now under contract with the remaining in advanced stages of negotiations. We have our latest estimates for productivity and reasonable learning curves that we believe are appropriate based on our historical experience. Of course, we now have one lot under contract, and we'll finalize quantities of the next four lots over time as well. In the economy and inflationary factors have stabilized a bit over the past year, and we'll continue to track those, of course, over time as well. But perhaps most importantly, we're still performing well on this program, which is continuing to provide a critical capability for our customers. In terms of the long-term NPV, we think that's the most important thing is that our customers will get great value from the aircraft. We'll deliver them over time, and that should, over time, also lead to value for the company and our shareholders.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Douglas Harned with Bernstein. You may proceed.\nDouglas Harned: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to go back to the Sentinel program. And when -- what you've described is that I think because that EMD is going well. But when you look at where this is headed and what came out with the Air Force commentary on the Nunn-McCurdy breach. A couple of things that I wanted to understand better. They're talking about potentially a 2-year delay in IOC, they're also -- also you talked about it a little bit, but to understand how much of this breach is due to potential changes in requirements and things that are, in a sense, under your purview versus those that may be under others, including the government customer?\nKathy Warden: Yes. So as you note, there is a delay to IOC, the reason though for the Nunn-McCurdy breach is the cost growth. So oftentimes scheduled delays add costs to the program, that is not the primary contributor. It is, as you noted, design decisions, particularly related to the command and launch requirements that the Air Force has and that affects the deployment in the launch facilities in each of the silos. And so that is what we are working to inform the Air Force decision process on alternatives and ways to reduce those costs and procurement and yet those are Air Force cost estimates, and they include a significant amount of scope that is outside of the industry team's execution. But nonetheless, we will help to inform those discussions if they're ongoing during this review process.\nDouglas Harned: And does the delay in the timing, does this have much effect right now on your outlook for the overall profitability of the program.\nKathy Warden: It does not, Doug, our near-term assumptions on both the ramp of the program relative to sales as well as the profitability of the program are not materially impacted.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. You may proceed.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning everyone. Thank you. Kathy or Dave, maybe if you could just talk about the free cash flow guidance that you're sticking with the 15% CAGR. Just the drivers in terms of top line working capital, Section 174, and the impact of B-21, Dave, I think you said 60% of that over $600 million is through 2026. Is that right? And do we think about Sentinel as a positive cash contributor?\nDavid Keffer: Sure. Thanks for the question, Sheila. I'm happy to dig into that. The strength of the free cash flow outlook we really think of as one of the highlights our report today. And so happy to dig into that in more detail. And I think you heard correctly that 60% of the charge is associated with the period through 2026 from a cash flow perspective. I think importantly, the strength of the broad base of other programs across the business is serving to offset those pressures. And that's what we're seeing in our ability to maintain and build confidence in our multiyear outlook including adding a strong 2026 year to that outlook that continues the double-digit growth trajectory that we expect for the next several years. We had a great finish to 2023 for free cash flow, really strong working capital performance, and that is enabling us to build confidence in our ability to continue to perform at similar levels going forward. As a company, we've put a lot of focus on working capital efficiency, on capital efficiency, on driving cash returns on recent investments and that is clearly showing up in the results and the performance of all of our sectors. We're proud of their performance on cash in Q4 and in the outlooks for 2024 and beyond. And the net effect of all of these factors is that unchanged free cash flow outlook for 2024 and 2025, along with a strong 2026. I'd highlight in terms of what drives that going forward? What's the underlying force as you point out? Certainly, the operations of the business growth in the top line is, first and foremost, with an opportunity for growth at the margin rate line as well that leads to really strong margin dollar volume, which will convert into cash through the strong working capital performance that we expect to continue which is essentially a stable assumption in our outlook. We're not looking for significant additional efficiencies given just how strong we were at the end of 2023. And then as we noted earlier, there are other structural factors that should help as well with CAS pension reimbursement growing slightly over the next few years and cash tax is projected to decline over that same period. So essentially, all of those factors will lead to strong -- strong free cash flow growth outlook for the next several years and beyond.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\nSeth Seifman: Thanks very much. And good morning. I guess a 2-part question about B-21. First was the $143 million EAC in the quarter, is that the extent of the entire anticipated loss on lot 1 and I guess, how do we think about the progression of losses on the various lots? And then second, the fact that this charge includes lots that will be in budgets in 2026 and 2027 and not come under contract for a while and not be worked on for a while. I guess how would you assess the opportunity to maybe ultimately do a little bit better than anticipated here.\nDavid Keffer: Sure. I can start on that, Seth. I think you've read properly into the $143 million EAC adjustment with Lot 1 having been awarded and the other is not yet awarded, that one does take the form of an EAC adjustment. So that $143 million is the lot 1 amount we are currently projecting. And the future progression while we can't get into much detail because that would involve a lot sizes and quantities and other classified details. Clearly, the implication is that there's modest growth from lot 1 to future lots on average. Over time, I think you're thinking of this the right way that our current projections would indicate an average of a couple of hundred million dollars a year of after-tax impact on our -- on the cash line from B-21, and that's, as I referred to a few minutes ago, the headwind we've been able to mitigate through strength in the rest of the business. In terms of your point about opportunity to outperform that over the long-term. Clearly, it is a core focus of our team to continue to drive efficiencies in the learning curves, successful outcomes of our negotiations with suppliers. We continue to engage and partner with our customer to understand macroeconomic impacts on the program and address opportunities for funding of relief, as Kathy mentioned earlier. And so we'll continue to address all of those opportunities. This is something we'll update you in the rest of the Street on over time.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with TD Cowen. You may proceed.\nCai Von Rumohr: Thanks so much. Kathy best wishes to feel better.\nKathy Warden: It sounds like you need those wishes as well.\nCai Von Rumohr: So anyway, so you had the loss on the B-21 kind of it didn't look like a loss couple of quarters ago. You've had your second loss on Halo. This is clearly proving to be an environment where on fixed price contract, there is more risk. Have you changed your strategy regarding how you bid and specifically with reference to Tranche 2 of the tracking satellites because you were on Tranche 1 and you were not on Tranche 2. So have you changed your strategy in terms of how you're bidding? And are there any contracts that you bid before changing your strategy that would still have risk that we're not aware of today?\nKathy Warden: Very insightful question as always, Cai. So when you look back to 2015, when we did B-21, we certainly have changed our view on bidding of contracts where did not have a mature design. It's a point of bid and yet we committed to fixed price options into the future. And we have, to my knowledge, not done that again. And we have passed on some high-profile programs as a result of the risk balance that the customer put forward in the RFP not meeting our standards. We have programs like Halo, which we have certainly learned some additional lessons and are applying those as we move forward. And you note on some very recent bids, we have taken a different approach in looking at firm fixed price, where we've either declined a bit if the customer chose to go fixed price or we've offered a price -- in the case of SDA Tranche 2 that we thought was fair and reasonable and the customer decided not to further negotiate with us. These are things that are going to happen and we're going to remain disciplined. We have plenty of opportunity in this company to grow. We have a strong pipeline of opportunities we're pursuing. And a strong pipeline of opportunities that we believe have the right risk/reward balance with industry.\nCai Von Rumohr: Thanks so much. Feel better.\nKathy Warden: Thank you too.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Gavin Parsons (NYSE:PSN) with UBS. You may proceed.\nGavin Parsons: Thanks, good morning.\nKathy Warden: Good morning.\nGavin Parsons: Maybe just following on Ron's question. Does the B-21 charge contemplate current conditions as they are? Does it have some consideration for future uncertainty in macro or supply chain?\nKathy Warden: With all of our EACs, B-21 included, we do our best based on what we know today to project conditions out into the future. Now with that said, that's difficult to do longer-term that period of performance is. So in this case, we're looking out over greater than 5 years. So as we get into those out years, that's a bit more speculative, but we do incorporate our expectations for changes in everything from material labor pricing to productivity and learning.\nGavin Parsons: Okay. Understood. And Dave, you mentioned the IRS appeal process. Any way to put a range around the possible cash impact on that?\nDavid Keffer: No, I'd refer you to our tax disclosures for more than enough detail on all of those fronts. It's tough to put a range around those things. We're looking forward to getting through processes, as you know, from those disclosures, we have a lot of open years that have yet to be resolved and looking forward to working with the IRS to come to reasonable resolutions there, and we'll update you on any book or tax differences from current reserves as we get there.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.\nScott Deuschle: Hey good morning.\nKathy Warden: Good morning.\nScott Deuschle: Dave, can you give us a sense for the proportion of supplier costs across the 5 LRIP lots that have now been fixed versus what's still open to negotiation?\nDavid Keffer: Sure. As we noted a few moments ago, we're now at a majority of the supplier costs that have been fully negotiated across the LRIP phase. And we're in various stages of negotiation with suppliers for the remainder. So that's one area where we have learn more and progressed in our process compared to where we were a year ago or even a quarter ago.\nScott Deuschle: Okay. Great. And then just as a follow-up, where does the commercial inventory come from in the space business? And is that EBIT headwind mostly gone now? Or is there any more of that left to come in 2024? Thank you.\nDavid Keffer: Sure. Thanks for the question. We had offsetting effects in 2024 and 2023, rather, including Q4 in the commercial elements of the space business. As you know, those are much smaller than and kind of tangential to the core national security space business that we have. In the case of those commercial inventory write-downs, those were related to newer investments in product lines to address burgeoning market opportunity in both the government and commercial elements of the space market. We did see some modest write-downs in various quarters in 2023 associated with those. Those are the types of things you occasionally go through as you make such new investments. So again, not core to the current or future growth story of the space business.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.\nKenneth Herbert: Yes, thank you good morning. Maybe, Kathy, at a high level, I wanted to follow up on your comments earlier regarding sort of the key margin drivers you outlined last year. Specifically more on the cost and productivity efforts and maybe on the mix side, are you seeing incrementally more opportunity now as we think about 2024? And how should we think about sort of the absolute opportunity on those now into this year versus perhaps how much more of a benefit we see in 2025 and beyond.\nKathy Warden: Thanks, Ken. We laid out 3 drivers, the first of which being stabilization in macroeconomics, and we are certainly seeing that in 2024, which is why we see our margin rates this year in line with last with some opportunity for improvement as we go throughout the year. We layer on top of that cost and productivity actions that we are taking in the company, and that will provide some tailwinds in 2024 growing tailwinds into 2025. And the mix shift really is a bit of a longer-term proposition for us. We've talked about that being a shift from cost type to fixed price, where we expect 2023 was really our high watermark for cost type, but a very gradual shift in that mix to fixed price with more of it coming in the latter half of this decade. And then international mix is the other where we don't expect significant international growth in 2024, but we do expect that to step up based on our pipeline and particularly the strong weapons demand outside the U.S. in 2025. That gives you a sense of what will be a tailwind to margin rate win.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.\nMyles Walton: Thanks, good morning. I was wondering, Dave, or Kathy, you previously talked about a $4 billion free cash flow target in 2028, effectively doubling what you've done in 2023. I just want to make sure that's still on the table, despite the charge absorption in that period of time? And then maybe, Kathy, on the margin expansion specific to Aerospace, is that still a 10% margin business? Or do we have to glide slope down a little bit further into 2025, 2026.\nDavid Keffer: Thanks for the question, Myles. Let me kick off with the 2023 free cash flow number. I appreciate the question on that because I think that too is core to the outlook going forward. Yes, we are reaffirming that $4 billion target for 2028. And essentially doubling the level that we were projecting at the midpoint of our 2023 guidance, which was $2 billion. Of course, we exceeded that by $100 million in our final result for 2023. The drivers of that growth are much of what we've talked about already. Certainly, growth in the top line. As Kathy just noted, some of the drivers of margin rate expansion opportunity which leads to margin dollars having an opportunity to exceed the growth rate of our top line through 2028. And importantly, CapEx will moderate during that same period. So we've noted that 2023 and 2024 of these peak years of capital intensity that continues to be our outlook with declines in 2025 and beyond. And then pension and tax will serve as tailwinds during that same period. So that leads you to the $4 billion number. And I think if you look at the 2024 and 2025 numbers we've reiterated for our free cash outlook today and add in that 2026 range, you'll get to that same glide slope that would push you upward toward the $4 billion number by 2028. So those are the building blocks and the way we plan to get there.\nKathy Warden: And Myles, on AS margins, what we're seeing, as Dave noted earlier is that with the B-21 growth being a bit stronger than we had anticipated, AS is stepping up on top line. It is putting some pressure on margin rate, but margin dollars are exactly where we had anticipated they would be coming into 2024, and our guide therefore, remained consistent for AS on a dollar basis, even though we now are looking at more of a mid-9s rate projection. As you go out over time, it's less dependent on what happens with absorbing that lower rate on B-21 and more what happens in terms of other new programs coming into the AS portfolio and the rate at which we will book those programs. So we'll provide you more insight into that over the coming year as we look towards 2025 and beyond.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. You may proceed.\nRobert Spingarn: Hey good morning. Kathy, a few minutes ago, you alluded to international and I wanted to bring up IBCS because it's had some strong demand signals from international customers and thought maybe you could dig into that program a little bit, give us a sense of how large it is in revenue or how -- in 2023 or 2024? And how big it might be, let's say, 5 years from now?\nKathy Warden: It certainly is an area of strength in our portfolio. We've seen strong performance by the team on the U.S. Army program and also as we are deploying in Poland, and we see follow-on opportunities in Poland as a result. We've also, as I\u2019ve spoken about throughout the course of 2023, added a number of additional countries who have expressed interest in the program to the pipeline, and that's what would drive the growth that we anticipate in the 2025 time frame. As you noted, I mentioned international demand. Part of that is weapons part of that is the IBCS portfolio. And then, of course, we have some aircraft and mission system strength in the pipeline for international in 2025 as well. The program itself is growing at a fairly rapid rate, but off of a relatively small it's about $400 million of annual sales. And we expect that to grow, of course, but not a major contributor is the enterprise line for growth.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. You may proceed.\nGeorge Shapiro: Good morning. Kathy, I wanted to ask on the charge for the B-21, what caused it to be bigger than the 0 to $1.2 billion range that you've kind of been reiterating since last year? And then just specifically, maybe the margin that you had said would be around 10% is now maybe 9.5%. I know you alluded to a few minutes ago, the B-21 was growing faster. But it\u2019s got to grow a lot faster to drop the margin by 50 basis points. So I was just wondering if you could explore that a little bit more. Thanks very much.\nKathy Warden: Let me start with the first part of your question and Dave will cover the second. As we noted, we identified this risk last year, and we, throughout the year, revisited it on a quarterly basis. There were 2 primary changes in the fourth quarter that both led us to deem it probable loss as well as impacted the value of that loss. First, we significantly reduced our projections for funding related to macroeconomic impacts, as we've talked about a couple of times already. Although we continue to partner with the government to address these impacts. We believe it's prudent in light of the current budget status to reduce those assumptions. And so we did that. The second is we've experienced growth in our cost projection, both in the internal production costs as we've continued to build aircraft as Dave talked about through our negotiations with suppliers. We have learned and built that learning into the forward-looking estimates that we now have in the EAC, so those were the factors. As we've talked about, we did a very detailed look at this EAC in the fourth quarter and had matured and had actual data to reflect on that we did not have at an earlier point.\nDavid Keffer: Let me follow up on the second part of your question because I do think it's an important nuance. The AS business was operating in the mid-10 billions in scale over the past year, it exceeded our original expectations in sales in 2023 and now is projected to exceed them even more significantly compared to where they were a year ago in 2024. We were talking about a flat 2023 and very modest growth in 2024 based off of that mid-tens level. And now we're all the way up into the low 11s. And so that low 11s at a mid-9% margin rate is the same as the mid-to-high 10s at a slightly higher margin rate. We're really focused on driving the dollar volume of operating margin in our Aeronautics business and across our business, it's that return on invested capital, the growth in margin dollars and in free cash flow that results from it, that is really our core focus.\nTodd Ernst: Josh, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our final question. Our final question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi. You may proceed.\nJason Gursky: Hey good morning everybody. Dave, just a clarification question for you to start. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that there were some shifting priorities from the government and the space business that was leading to a deceleration in growth. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on what those shifting priorities might be? And then Kathy, I just wanted to provide you maybe a bit of an open-ended question to kind of wrap all this together here. Just broadly talk about all the risks and opportunities that you see in front of you on the execution side of things. You've obviously got record backlog here and we know about the B-21 risk. But I'm wondering if you could just maybe highlight and wrap this all together, do we have a balanced risk and opportunities portfolio here, we a little bit more overweight risk than we are opportunity? And maybe just kind of dive into a little bit of the details of what you're seeing and maybe what you're all doing to address those issues. Thanks.\nDavid Keffer: Sure. Great questions, Jason. Let me go ahead and start with your original question on the national security space portfolio. As we mentioned, our guidance captures growth and declines in various programs across all of our portfolios, very much including space. In the case of space, as we've noted, there are some shifts in budget priorities. A lot of our customers are having to address budget prioritization, particularly as it relates to 2025 and beyond. With that said, in this particular case, given that it's in the restricted domain, there's not much more we can say about the mission or the program or anything like that. What's important there is that our space sector, and therefore, company guidance accounts for our latest understanding of all the programs in that portfolio and the likely path forward for them. And I think when you look at the space guidance, you see a lot of value creation as they continue to grow the top line. And in this case, now grow margin rates alongside that with lower capital intensity starting in 2025, in particular, you see a lot of improvement in returns on invested capital in the space business, given how much growth they've built in their foundation over the last few years.\nJason Gursky: Kathy?\nKathy Warden: And Jason, I really appreciate the question. I wish I had another hour to discuss it with you, but being respectful of everybody's time, let me just simply say that I see our portfolio and the set of opportunities and risks we have as balanced and consistent with what I have seen in recent years since I stepped into this role. We have a team who has stepped up and provided top line growth, which I believe is industry leading at about 5% on a compound annual basis each of the last four years. We're projecting that again this year. We see the opportunity space is rich, both domestically and internationally. And to the risks that we have in executing this portfolio, while the pandemic certainly made that more challenging for the last couple of years. We're turning the corner. Our overall program performance has not been stronger since I've been at the company, and that's 15 years and going. So I really feel good about how this team is positioned. We now have fully disclosed and taken into the P&L the B-21 risk, which we've been talking about and feel confident that we can now go execute this program. And I am proud of what the team collectively has accomplished across 2023 and look forward to the outlook we have in place for 2024. So with that, I just want to again thank my colleagues at Northrop Grumman for their dedication, both to our country and our company. I also want to thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in April. So Josh, that concludes the call. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you.

Welcome to Northrop Grumman's Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2023 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. My name is Josh, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.\nTodd Ernst: Thanks, Josh. Good morning and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Fourth Quarter 2023 Conference Call. This morning, we'll refer to a presentation that is posted to our IR website. Before we get started, matters discussed on today's call, including guidance and outlooks for 2024 and beyond reflect the company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including those noted in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially. Today's call will include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release. And on the call today are Kathy Warden, our Chair, CEO and President; and Dave Keffer, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?\nKathy Warden: Thanks Todd. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Before discussing our 2023 results, I wanted to take a moment to thank our team for their hard work and dedication to our important mission. Our talented workforce which is now over a 100,000 strong continues to deliver some of the most advanced technologies in the world. These capabilities are used by our customer\u2019s everyday to defend freedom and deter aggression around the globe. The geopolitical landscape has grown even more complex driving continued increases in global security spending. Our strategies has positioned us well to compete and win in this growing market which has translated into accelerating topline growth for Northrop Grumman. Revenue increased by over 7% in 2023 [indiscernible] more than a billion above the midpoint of our original 2023 guidance. In addition, our book-to-bill for the year was 1.14 times, that\u2019s in line with our exceptional four year average. As a result of this award strength, we achieved a new record backlog which now exceeds $84 billion and now provides a healthy foundation for our continued growth. The underlying performance of our company is strong. We generated free cash flow at the high end of our guidance range, and we comfortably exceeded our sales and EPS guidance range, absence of B-21 charge. While we're disappointed that our assessment of conditions for the low rate initial production portion of the B-21 program necessitated this charge in the quarter, we are confident in our ability to deliver on the company's forward outlook, which remains unchanged. We're also proud of the performance of the B-21 team, which continues to execute an unparalleled aircraft development program. As we look forward, we will continue to execute our business strategy, which at its core is based on technology differentiation, a laser focus on performance, and value delivery for our customers and shareholders. To support this strategy, we are prioritizing investment in our capacity and capabilities. In 2023, we invested over $2.9 billion in R&D and CapEx, that's 7.5% of sales, to continue driving innovation and capacity to support our customer mission success. We also delivered over $2.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, representing a return of approximately 125% of our 2023 free cash flow. So now I'll highlight a few examples of progress we've made across the portfolio that further bolster my confidence in our future. Shortly after the close of the fourth quarter, we announced our GEM 63XL solid rocket boosters helped to successfully power ULA\u2019s Vulcan launch vehicle on its first mission. Future Vulcan missions will utilize additional GEM 63XLs in support of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Kuiper, and other ULA customers, providing a significant growth opportunity for our propulsion business. And this is an important milestone because it supports our investment to significantly ramp production capacity of GEM 63s in the coming years. Global demand for our weapons system increased in 2023, and we expect this trend to continue. In this market, we're both a supplier and a prime. We're a supplier of propulsion systems, warheads, fuses, and cannons across a highly diversified customer base, and a prime contractor for predominantly air-to-ground missiles, including AARGM, AARGM-ER, and Stand-in Attack Weapon. Weapons systems currently represents approximately 7% of total revenue, and based on the demands we're seeing, we expect this business to grow faster than the company average for the foreseeable future, with a significant portion of this expansion coming from international customers. In our Mission Systems business, demand remains exceptionally strong, with a 2023 book-to-bill above 1.2 times, the highest of all of our segments. As we've seen in recent years, the restricted portfolio of Mission Systems is a meaningful driver of growth as our customers pursue solutions that enable them to operate inside the decision loop of potential adversaries who are also advancing their computing capabilities. We are helping our customers stay ahead by developing advanced microelectronics, sensors, processors, and secure communication. Our product lines are enabling faster cycles of modernization, positioning our customers with decision advantage in this rapidly advancing technology environment. And we continue to make significant progress on the EMD phase of Sentinel, which is the next generation land-based leg of the strategic triad. We are achieving milestones to mature the design and reduce risk, including key test activities, such as the successful static fire test of the Sentinel Stage 2 solid rocket motor for the missile earlier this month. Last week, the Air Force submitted to Congress a new set of cost estimates for the program, which triggered a Nunn-McCurdy Breach. This in turn launches a review of the program by the Department of Defense, which we expect to be ongoing for the next several months. It's important to note that the cost growth is primarily driven by estimates for the command and launch facility build-out, which is part of the military construction and procurement phases of the program. We and our industry team are continuing to perform on the EMD phase in close partnership with the U.S. Air Force. And we'll work with the government to explore opportunities to reduce costs on the program with a focus on the late 2020s and beyond when the program is expected to move into the procurement phase. And in the fourth quarter, the B-21 entered its flight test phase. This is a major milestone for the program and achieving it within the baseline schedule is a credit to the Northrop Grumman team and our close partnership with the U.S. Air Force over the past several years. Following this milestone, we were awarded the first LRIP lot in the fourth quarter and production is now underway. Let me take a few moments to provide a little more detail on the B-21 charge. The possibility of which we started talking with you about at this time last year. As you know, like all of industry, we and our suppliers have experienced cost pressure from recent global macroeconomic conditions, which are significantly different from the assumptions the team made when bidding these five production lots in 2015. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we again reviewed our estimated profitability on the LRIP phase of the program. And we now believe it is probable each of the first five LRIP lots will be performed at a loss. The charge is largely driven by a change in our assumptions regarding funding to mitigate the impact of macroeconomic disruptions on the LRIP phase of the program and higher projected manufacturing costs that reflect recent supplier negotiations and our experience in completing the first aircraft. The after tax cash impact related to these updates will be spread over a number of years. Importantly, we have absorbed this effect and we have not changed our outlook for free cash flow growth over the next several years. This is a game changing capability that will be of great value to our nation. And we are focused on executing the program in a way that also delivers value to our shareholders over the coming decades. Turning now to the budget environment. Global national security spending is increasing as the U.S. and allies invest in capabilities to deter and defend against aggression. Demand for our capabilities remain strong due to our differentiated portfolio and alignment to customer priorities including the triad, space and weapons. In the U.S., our franchise programs remain well supported by Congress and the Department of Defense. And this gives us confidence in our outlook even in a constrained U.S. budget environment. We are pleased to have an NDAA in place that provides continued support for defense spending. And we're hopeful that Congress will enact appropriations soon. Our guidance assumes we will not have a shutdown or a full year CR, and we're encouraged by the progress we've seen so far towards passing appropriations in the March timeframe. Additionally, we are monitoring progress on supplemental funding and we see opportunities in expanding the industrial base and increasing munitions production in this pending request. Our allies are also increasing their defense spending and we expect our alignment with their needs for aircraft, weapon systems and mission systems to be an additional source of growth. So as we look to the future, we have the right portfolio and team to deliver on our long-term outlook. Our organic sales have grown at a greater than 5% annual rate since 2019. And our guidance calls for continued growth of 4% to 5% in 2024. Segment operating margin dollars are expected to grow at roughly the same rate as sales in 2024. And our 2024 EPS guidance range of $24.45 to $24.85 at the midpoint represents roughly 6% growth excluding the B-21 charge and 11% growth compared to our initial EPS estimates which we provided for in 2023. In addition, the structural building blocks to expand our margins that we outlined in last year's 2Q earnings call, including dissipating macroeconomic headwinds, implementation of productivity and cost savings initiatives and future favorable mix shift remain in place. We are laser focused on performance and bid discipline to drive margin expansion. And importantly, we continue to expect our free cash flow to grow at a double digit rate over the coming years. We are reaffirming our 2024 and 2025 free cash flow outlook. And we've also introduced a 2026 outlook of $3.3 billion at the midpoint. With the businesses generating significant cash flow, we have considerable flexibility in deploying capital to generate value for customers and shareholders. Our top priority remains investing to support our business strategy. And we expect to invest over 7% of sales again in 2024 in capital expenditures and R&D. At the same time, we'll continue to provide strong capital returns to our shareholders. Last month, our board of directors increased our share repurchase authorization by an additional $2.5 billion, and we ended the year with a remaining authorization of $3.6 billion. For 2024, we expect to increase our share repurchases to at least $2 billion. This includes a $1 billion ASR that we plan to initiate in the coming days based on the strong liquidity position with which we entered this year. So when we take these factors, sustainable top-line growth with expanding margins, and couple those with declining capital intensity and lower projected cash taxes, you get a recipe for robust cash flow growth for years to come. So now I'll turn it over to Dave to provide you more details on the segment results, 2024 guidance, and the forward outlook. Dave?\nDave Keffer: Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. We finished the year with strong momentum, enabling us to reaffirm and build upon our favorable forward outlook. I'll start by elaborating on our 2023 results and then provide additional details on our guidance. On the demand side, we ended 2023 with over $84 billion in backlog, a new record for our company. All four of our segments generated a full-year book-to-bill ratio over one-time sales. We also continued to deliver strong top-line results with Q4 sales of $10.6 billion, up 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Full-year sales were even stronger, up over 7% at $39.3 billion, or roughly $300 million higher than our latest guidance. These top-line results were enabled not only by the strong demand environment we're seeing among our customers, but also by our ability to ramp on new programs, expand our workforce, and convert our backlog into sales. Moving to segment results, we generated sales growth in each of our businesses in 2023. Aeronautics sales were up 2% for the year, returning to growth earlier than previously expected. AS growth was driven by higher volume on restricted programs that more than offset declines on mature production programs. DS posted sales growth of 5%, led by higher volume in the weapons and missile defense portfolio. Mission System sales were also up 5%, driven by higher restricted sales on advanced microelectronics programs and higher volume on marine systems programs. And our space business posted another quarter of double-digit top-line growth, with sales up approximately 14% for the year. Nearly 40% of the growth came from Sentinel and NGI, with the rest coming from our broad space portfolio. As Kathy described, our segment margins included a charge for the B-21 program. The charge was primarily driven by the confluence of lower assumptions around macroeconomic disruption funding and higher production cost projections. While the full pre-tax charge had the effect of lowering our segment margins, only $143 million has been recorded as an EAC adjustment, including a $43 million reduction to Q4 sales. The remaining was booked as a contingent liability because the majority of the lots have yet to be awarded. The charge also led to an $82 million benefit in corporate unallocated expense, stemming from a reduction in deferred state taxes. Continuing with our results, slide 5 shows a comparison of our 2023 earnings per share to the guidance we provided in October. Diluted EPS includes a $2.08 unfavorable mark-to-market adjustment from our pension plans and a $7.68 per share impact from the B-21 charge. Absent these items, we would have exceeded the high end of our prior EPS guidance range by over $0.40. Our 2023 mark-to-market adjusted EPS also included significantly less pension income compared to 2022. In total, net pension costs generated a $4.07 per share headwind in 2023. Next, I'll take a few moments to discuss our cash flows. As is our historical pattern, we had an outstanding quarter of cash performance in Q4, generating $1.6 billion in free cash flow. For the full year, our operating cash flow was $3.9 billion, and our free cash flow was $2.1 billion. This result was near the high end of our guidance range and represented free cash flow growth of 30% compared to 2022. Turning to pension results, we generated strong asset returns of roughly 11% in 2023, ahead of our long-term assumptions. The FAS discount rate declined by roughly 40 basis points to 5.15%. Netted together, along with updated census data, this generated a mark-to-market pension expense of $422 million in our GAAP results. Slide 7 in our earnings deck summarizes our pension estimates for the next three years. We continue to expect CAS recoveries to increase from current levels, providing a benefit to our cash flows, but slightly less than prior projections. And we expect a higher level of non-operating FAS pension income in the coming years, driven by our strong asset returns in 2023. In total, our funded status remains superb at nearly 100%, and we continue to project minimal cash pension contributions over the next several years. Turning to 2024, slide 9 in our earnings deck includes our segment-level guidance. Building off the strong top-line results in Q4, we now expect aeronautics sales in the low 11 billions, driven by growth on B-21 and on other programs such as F-35 and E-2D. This is higher than our prior sales estimates for AS, which reflected a flat 2023 and modest growth in 2024. Higher B-21 sales also result in a slightly lower margin rate expectation for AS, which we now project in the mid-9%, netting out to a similar volume of margin dollars compared to prior estimates. DS sales are expected to be roughly $6 billion, up low single digits from 2023. As we mentioned on the Q3 call, DS has really turned the corner on growth through strong demand for weapons and missile defense capabilities. We are optimistic in our ability to convert these opportunities into sustained growth in this business over time, which we expect to be partially offset by modest declines in the sustainment and training portions of the business. Margins are projected to remain strong at DS in the low 12% range. Mission System sales are expected in the low to mid $11 billion range for another year of mid-single digit growth, with margins of roughly 15%. And that space, after expanding sales at a greater than 17% CAGR since 2019, growth is expected to moderate in 2024 with higher segment margins. Space sales are now expected in the mid-to-high $14 billion range, with margins of approximately 9%. The mid-single digit growth rate in space reflects declines in a restricted program due to shifts in government priority, which are more than offset by growth in other parts of the space portfolio. Having built a tremendous backlog in recent years, space now has an opportunity to deliver strong ROI through more measured growth, along with margin expansion and cash generation. At the company level, our guidance reflects growth in sales and segment margin between 4% 5%, absent the B-21 charge, consistent with the outlook we provided on our October call, even after delivering top line upside in Q4. We expect another solid year of bookings, with a book-to-bill around one times. And similar to our cadence over the last few years, we expect sales to ramp throughout the year, with first quarter sales a little less than 24% of our full year estimate. We plan to be in the market soon for new debt issuance to take advantage of the favorable rate environment. The proceeds from the debt issuance will also be used in part to support refinancings of $1.5 billion of notes that are coming due in January of 2025, as well as for general corporate purposes and share repurchases, including the $1 billion ASR we intend to initiate in the coming days. We've reflected this debt issuance in our interest expense guidance, and we'd also expect interest income to contribute to the EPS line, as it did in 2023. We project an effective tax rate of approximately 17% in 2024, consistent with the range we've experienced over the last few years, excluding the mark-to-market adjustment and other unique items. We're coming closer to conclusions on a number of open audit and appeals processes with the IRS, which could have positive or negative effects on book and cash taxes as they're resolved over the next couple of years, and our forward guidance does not include any such adjustments. Similarly, we have not factored any potential changes to R&D tax legislation into our outlook. And as a reminder, our interpretation of current tax law results in a projected 5-year impact from R&D amortization of approximately $2 billion. We will continue to track these matters carefully and provide updates as they progress. In total, we expect our 2024 earnings per share to be between $24.45 and $24.85 on with approximately 148.5 million weighted shares outstanding. Moving to cash, we expect 2024 free cash flow between $2.25 billion and $2.65 billion consistent with our prior outlook. And as we've said before, capital expenditures are expected to remain elevated in 2024 before moderating in 2025 and beyond. Slide 11 in our earnings deck provides an update to our long-term free cash flow outlook to include 2026. We continue to expect our free cash flow to grow at a double-digit rate for several more years with additional growth in the second half of the decade. This expansion will be driven by sustained growth in our business, generating strong operating margin volume and converting those profits into cash. Meanwhile, lower cash taxes, higher CAS recoveries and lower levels of capital spending in the coming years provide additional structural levers to expand our cash flows at a rapid rate. Importantly, these ranges also include the latest estimated cash impacts associated with the B-21 charge. We expect roughly 60% of the charge to affect cash flows through 2026 with the remainder in the following years. Longer-term, we are confident we'll be able to continue to absorb the cash headwinds from B-21 while delivering excellent free cash flows in 2027 and beyond. In closing, I want to thank the entire Northrop Grumman team for their contributions to another great year. The strength of our portfolio and visibility of franchise programs provides us the opportunity to deliver and deploy robust cash flows as we execute on our strategy. And with that, let's open up the call to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you.[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\nKristine Liwag: Hey good morning, Kathy and Dave.\nKathy Warden: Good morning.\nKristine Liwag: Kathy, on the B-21, you've been very clear about the pressures on this program. Ultimately, how much relief did the customer extend to you to offset macro pressures and elevate [ph] portion. And is there still a possibility of future relief?\nKathy Warden: So Kristine, we've been working with the customer. And as we noted, the conversations continue. And last year, in 2023, we and Air Force disclosed that about $60 million of $1.5 billion that Congress appropriated for inflation was allocated to the advanced procurement for Lot 1 on this program. But we have yet to work through what that relief may be in future lots. We have, of course, as we said, updated our assumptions -- and through conversation and the tight budget environment, we've actually lowered the expectations for inflation relief. And so at this point, our focus is on executing this program and finding opportunities in the performance on the program while we continue to work with the government to see if there is any inflation relief opportunity.\nKristine Liwag: Great, thank you. And I\u2019ll keep it to one today. Thank you.\nKathy Warden: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Richard  Safran  (EPA:SAF) with Seaport Global. You may proceed.\nRichard Safran: Kathy, Dave good morning. So I know you're going to get a lot of questions on the B-21, but I thought I'd ask you about to expand on your opening remarks about Sentinel. I thought you might talk a bit more about the actions you're taking at the program back on track. How are you seeing risk on the program right now? And I guess, importantly, what you think the government's level support for the program is given all the headlines and what we've been seeing?\nKathy Warden: Yes. Thanks, Rich. So as the land-based leg of the nuclear triad, Sentinel is a top priority for the Department of Defense. The requirement for the program has been validated numerous times by multiple administrations, and we expect that to be the outcome of this latest review. As the Air Force is reported, the non-operating cost reach on the program is largely due to cost growth in the military construction and procurement segments of the program, and we and the industry team are currently executing on the cost plus EMD phase of the program. That's important because our design work in this phase is helping the Air Force to better estimate the costs of those later phases and due to a number of factors of learning their cost estimates for these later phases have increased, and that's what's driving the non-[indiscernible] breach as the Air Force has said, growth on the EMD would not have triggered the breach. I'll also note that their update captures the inflation since 2020, the last time they did a cost estimate. And we all know that there's been significantly higher inflation than what was assumed at that time. So some of that is what you're also seeing reflected in these latest cost estimates. I mean with that said, though, you asked about our performance on the program, and I'm really pleased to report on the progress that our team has made over the last 3 years while we've been executing on the EMD phase. We've on boarded thousands of engineers. We've matured the system design. We've produced and tested critical hardware in the missile system, as I've outlined earlier on the call. We've also engaged in risk reduction, which is helping to inform the Air Force launch facility modernization and we've done all this while also doing detailed planning for the future phase of the program. I myself have visited the missile fields actually, I was at one last Friday, which is part of why I've got this cold, I brought back. And I met with the Airmen [ph], who have committed themselves to this important mission. So we're all in. We know how important this is our team is partnering closely with the Air Force, and we're going to help them to deliver this essential capability for our nation.\nRichard Safran: Thanks for that. Feel better.\nKathy Warden: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. You may proceed.\nRonald Epstein: Hey good morning everyone. So maybe just jumping back to B-21. Charges like there's some programs have a tendency to accumulate over time. They don't tend to go the other way. How should we think about it as we go forward? I mean, this is what for the first 5 LRIPs, how many LRIPs could there be? And how do we think about the bounds on this? And then maybe one last thing. Is the program NPV positive and if it is, when does it actually become NPV positive, cash flow positive and so on and so forth. If you could just peel back the onion on the program.\nDavid Keffer: Sure. I can go ahead and get started with that. And see if we can address a number of questions you raised. First of all, in terms of the future, we'll continue to update our projections every quarter as we do with all of our large programs. But it's important to note, we have a lot more information today than we did at this time last year, having completed the production in the ground test phase of the first aircraft. We also have the majority of the suppliers now under contract with the remaining in advanced stages of negotiations. We have our latest estimates for productivity and reasonable learning curves that we believe are appropriate based on our historical experience. Of course, we now have one lot under contract, and we'll finalize quantities of the next four lots over time as well. In the economy and inflationary factors have stabilized a bit over the past year, and we'll continue to track those, of course, over time as well. But perhaps most importantly, we're still performing well on this program, which is continuing to provide a critical capability for our customers. In terms of the long-term NPV, we think that's the most important thing is that our customers will get great value from the aircraft. We'll deliver them over time, and that should, over time, also lead to value for the company and our shareholders.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Douglas Harned with Bernstein. You may proceed.\nDouglas Harned: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to go back to the Sentinel program. And when -- what you've described is that I think because that EMD is going well. But when you look at where this is headed and what came out with the Air Force commentary on the Nunn-McCurdy breach. A couple of things that I wanted to understand better. They're talking about potentially a 2-year delay in IOC, they're also -- also you talked about it a little bit, but to understand how much of this breach is due to potential changes in requirements and things that are, in a sense, under your purview versus those that may be under others, including the government customer?\nKathy Warden: Yes. So as you note, there is a delay to IOC, the reason though for the Nunn-McCurdy breach is the cost growth. So oftentimes scheduled delays add costs to the program, that is not the primary contributor. It is, as you noted, design decisions, particularly related to the command and launch requirements that the Air Force has and that affects the deployment in the launch facilities in each of the silos. And so that is what we are working to inform the Air Force decision process on alternatives and ways to reduce those costs and procurement and yet those are Air Force cost estimates, and they include a significant amount of scope that is outside of the industry team's execution. But nonetheless, we will help to inform those discussions if they're ongoing during this review process.\nDouglas Harned: And does the delay in the timing, does this have much effect right now on your outlook for the overall profitability of the program.\nKathy Warden: It does not, Doug, our near-term assumptions on both the ramp of the program relative to sales as well as the profitability of the program are not materially impacted.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. You may proceed.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning everyone. Thank you. Kathy or Dave, maybe if you could just talk about the free cash flow guidance that you're sticking with the 15% CAGR. Just the drivers in terms of top line working capital, Section 174, and the impact of B-21, Dave, I think you said 60% of that over $600 million is through 2026. Is that right? And do we think about Sentinel as a positive cash contributor?\nDavid Keffer: Sure. Thanks for the question, Sheila. I'm happy to dig into that. The strength of the free cash flow outlook we really think of as one of the highlights our report today. And so happy to dig into that in more detail. And I think you heard correctly that 60% of the charge is associated with the period through 2026 from a cash flow perspective. I think importantly, the strength of the broad base of other programs across the business is serving to offset those pressures. And that's what we're seeing in our ability to maintain and build confidence in our multiyear outlook including adding a strong 2026 year to that outlook that continues the double-digit growth trajectory that we expect for the next several years. We had a great finish to 2023 for free cash flow, really strong working capital performance, and that is enabling us to build confidence in our ability to continue to perform at similar levels going forward. As a company, we've put a lot of focus on working capital efficiency, on capital efficiency, on driving cash returns on recent investments and that is clearly showing up in the results and the performance of all of our sectors. We're proud of their performance on cash in Q4 and in the outlooks for 2024 and beyond. And the net effect of all of these factors is that unchanged free cash flow outlook for 2024 and 2025, along with a strong 2026. I'd highlight in terms of what drives that going forward? What's the underlying force as you point out? Certainly, the operations of the business growth in the top line is, first and foremost, with an opportunity for growth at the margin rate line as well that leads to really strong margin dollar volume, which will convert into cash through the strong working capital performance that we expect to continue which is essentially a stable assumption in our outlook. We're not looking for significant additional efficiencies given just how strong we were at the end of 2023. And then as we noted earlier, there are other structural factors that should help as well with CAS pension reimbursement growing slightly over the next few years and cash tax is projected to decline over that same period. So essentially, all of those factors will lead to strong -- strong free cash flow growth outlook for the next several years and beyond.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\nSeth Seifman: Thanks very much. And good morning. I guess a 2-part question about B-21. First was the $143 million EAC in the quarter, is that the extent of the entire anticipated loss on lot 1 and I guess, how do we think about the progression of losses on the various lots? And then second, the fact that this charge includes lots that will be in budgets in 2026 and 2027 and not come under contract for a while and not be worked on for a while. I guess how would you assess the opportunity to maybe ultimately do a little bit better than anticipated here.\nDavid Keffer: Sure. I can start on that, Seth. I think you've read properly into the $143 million EAC adjustment with Lot 1 having been awarded and the other is not yet awarded, that one does take the form of an EAC adjustment. So that $143 million is the lot 1 amount we are currently projecting. And the future progression while we can't get into much detail because that would involve a lot sizes and quantities and other classified details. Clearly, the implication is that there's modest growth from lot 1 to future lots on average. Over time, I think you're thinking of this the right way that our current projections would indicate an average of a couple of hundred million dollars a year of after-tax impact on our -- on the cash line from B-21, and that's, as I referred to a few minutes ago, the headwind we've been able to mitigate through strength in the rest of the business. In terms of your point about opportunity to outperform that over the long-term. Clearly, it is a core focus of our team to continue to drive efficiencies in the learning curves, successful outcomes of our negotiations with suppliers. We continue to engage and partner with our customer to understand macroeconomic impacts on the program and address opportunities for funding of relief, as Kathy mentioned earlier. And so we'll continue to address all of those opportunities. This is something we'll update you in the rest of the Street on over time.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with TD Cowen. You may proceed.\nCai Von Rumohr: Thanks so much. Kathy best wishes to feel better.\nKathy Warden: It sounds like you need those wishes as well.\nCai Von Rumohr: So anyway, so you had the loss on the B-21 kind of it didn't look like a loss couple of quarters ago. You've had your second loss on Halo. This is clearly proving to be an environment where on fixed price contract, there is more risk. Have you changed your strategy regarding how you bid and specifically with reference to Tranche 2 of the tracking satellites because you were on Tranche 1 and you were not on Tranche 2. So have you changed your strategy in terms of how you're bidding? And are there any contracts that you bid before changing your strategy that would still have risk that we're not aware of today?\nKathy Warden: Very insightful question as always, Cai. So when you look back to 2015, when we did B-21, we certainly have changed our view on bidding of contracts where did not have a mature design. It's a point of bid and yet we committed to fixed price options into the future. And we have, to my knowledge, not done that again. And we have passed on some high-profile programs as a result of the risk balance that the customer put forward in the RFP not meeting our standards. We have programs like Halo, which we have certainly learned some additional lessons and are applying those as we move forward. And you note on some very recent bids, we have taken a different approach in looking at firm fixed price, where we've either declined a bit if the customer chose to go fixed price or we've offered a price -- in the case of SDA Tranche 2 that we thought was fair and reasonable and the customer decided not to further negotiate with us. These are things that are going to happen and we're going to remain disciplined. We have plenty of opportunity in this company to grow. We have a strong pipeline of opportunities we're pursuing. And a strong pipeline of opportunities that we believe have the right risk/reward balance with industry.\nCai Von Rumohr: Thanks so much. Feel better.\nKathy Warden: Thank you too.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Gavin Parsons (NYSE:PSN) with UBS. You may proceed.\nGavin Parsons: Thanks, good morning.\nKathy Warden: Good morning.\nGavin Parsons: Maybe just following on Ron's question. Does the B-21 charge contemplate current conditions as they are? Does it have some consideration for future uncertainty in macro or supply chain?\nKathy Warden: With all of our EACs, B-21 included, we do our best based on what we know today to project conditions out into the future. Now with that said, that's difficult to do longer-term that period of performance is. So in this case, we're looking out over greater than 5 years. So as we get into those out years, that's a bit more speculative, but we do incorporate our expectations for changes in everything from material labor pricing to productivity and learning.\nGavin Parsons: Okay. Understood. And Dave, you mentioned the IRS appeal process. Any way to put a range around the possible cash impact on that?\nDavid Keffer: No, I'd refer you to our tax disclosures for more than enough detail on all of those fronts. It's tough to put a range around those things. We're looking forward to getting through processes, as you know, from those disclosures, we have a lot of open years that have yet to be resolved and looking forward to working with the IRS to come to reasonable resolutions there, and we'll update you on any book or tax differences from current reserves as we get there.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.\nScott Deuschle: Hey good morning.\nKathy Warden: Good morning.\nScott Deuschle: Dave, can you give us a sense for the proportion of supplier costs across the 5 LRIP lots that have now been fixed versus what's still open to negotiation?\nDavid Keffer: Sure. As we noted a few moments ago, we're now at a majority of the supplier costs that have been fully negotiated across the LRIP phase. And we're in various stages of negotiation with suppliers for the remainder. So that's one area where we have learn more and progressed in our process compared to where we were a year ago or even a quarter ago.\nScott Deuschle: Okay. Great. And then just as a follow-up, where does the commercial inventory come from in the space business? And is that EBIT headwind mostly gone now? Or is there any more of that left to come in 2024? Thank you.\nDavid Keffer: Sure. Thanks for the question. We had offsetting effects in 2024 and 2023, rather, including Q4 in the commercial elements of the space business. As you know, those are much smaller than and kind of tangential to the core national security space business that we have. In the case of those commercial inventory write-downs, those were related to newer investments in product lines to address burgeoning market opportunity in both the government and commercial elements of the space market. We did see some modest write-downs in various quarters in 2023 associated with those. Those are the types of things you occasionally go through as you make such new investments. So again, not core to the current or future growth story of the space business.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.\nKenneth Herbert: Yes, thank you good morning. Maybe, Kathy, at a high level, I wanted to follow up on your comments earlier regarding sort of the key margin drivers you outlined last year. Specifically more on the cost and productivity efforts and maybe on the mix side, are you seeing incrementally more opportunity now as we think about 2024? And how should we think about sort of the absolute opportunity on those now into this year versus perhaps how much more of a benefit we see in 2025 and beyond.\nKathy Warden: Thanks, Ken. We laid out 3 drivers, the first of which being stabilization in macroeconomics, and we are certainly seeing that in 2024, which is why we see our margin rates this year in line with last with some opportunity for improvement as we go throughout the year. We layer on top of that cost and productivity actions that we are taking in the company, and that will provide some tailwinds in 2024 growing tailwinds into 2025. And the mix shift really is a bit of a longer-term proposition for us. We've talked about that being a shift from cost type to fixed price, where we expect 2023 was really our high watermark for cost type, but a very gradual shift in that mix to fixed price with more of it coming in the latter half of this decade. And then international mix is the other where we don't expect significant international growth in 2024, but we do expect that to step up based on our pipeline and particularly the strong weapons demand outside the U.S. in 2025. That gives you a sense of what will be a tailwind to margin rate win.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.\nMyles Walton: Thanks, good morning. I was wondering, Dave, or Kathy, you previously talked about a $4 billion free cash flow target in 2028, effectively doubling what you've done in 2023. I just want to make sure that's still on the table, despite the charge absorption in that period of time? And then maybe, Kathy, on the margin expansion specific to Aerospace, is that still a 10% margin business? Or do we have to glide slope down a little bit further into 2025, 2026.\nDavid Keffer: Thanks for the question, Myles. Let me kick off with the 2023 free cash flow number. I appreciate the question on that because I think that too is core to the outlook going forward. Yes, we are reaffirming that $4 billion target for 2028. And essentially doubling the level that we were projecting at the midpoint of our 2023 guidance, which was $2 billion. Of course, we exceeded that by $100 million in our final result for 2023. The drivers of that growth are much of what we've talked about already. Certainly, growth in the top line. As Kathy just noted, some of the drivers of margin rate expansion opportunity which leads to margin dollars having an opportunity to exceed the growth rate of our top line through 2028. And importantly, CapEx will moderate during that same period. So we've noted that 2023 and 2024 of these peak years of capital intensity that continues to be our outlook with declines in 2025 and beyond. And then pension and tax will serve as tailwinds during that same period. So that leads you to the $4 billion number. And I think if you look at the 2024 and 2025 numbers we've reiterated for our free cash outlook today and add in that 2026 range, you'll get to that same glide slope that would push you upward toward the $4 billion number by 2028. So those are the building blocks and the way we plan to get there.\nKathy Warden: And Myles, on AS margins, what we're seeing, as Dave noted earlier is that with the B-21 growth being a bit stronger than we had anticipated, AS is stepping up on top line. It is putting some pressure on margin rate, but margin dollars are exactly where we had anticipated they would be coming into 2024, and our guide therefore, remained consistent for AS on a dollar basis, even though we now are looking at more of a mid-9s rate projection. As you go out over time, it's less dependent on what happens with absorbing that lower rate on B-21 and more what happens in terms of other new programs coming into the AS portfolio and the rate at which we will book those programs. So we'll provide you more insight into that over the coming year as we look towards 2025 and beyond.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. You may proceed.\nRobert Spingarn: Hey good morning. Kathy, a few minutes ago, you alluded to international and I wanted to bring up IBCS because it's had some strong demand signals from international customers and thought maybe you could dig into that program a little bit, give us a sense of how large it is in revenue or how -- in 2023 or 2024? And how big it might be, let's say, 5 years from now?\nKathy Warden: It certainly is an area of strength in our portfolio. We've seen strong performance by the team on the U.S. Army program and also as we are deploying in Poland, and we see follow-on opportunities in Poland as a result. We've also, as I\u2019ve spoken about throughout the course of 2023, added a number of additional countries who have expressed interest in the program to the pipeline, and that's what would drive the growth that we anticipate in the 2025 time frame. As you noted, I mentioned international demand. Part of that is weapons part of that is the IBCS portfolio. And then, of course, we have some aircraft and mission system strength in the pipeline for international in 2025 as well. The program itself is growing at a fairly rapid rate, but off of a relatively small it's about $400 million of annual sales. And we expect that to grow, of course, but not a major contributor is the enterprise line for growth.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. You may proceed.\nGeorge Shapiro: Good morning. Kathy, I wanted to ask on the charge for the B-21, what caused it to be bigger than the 0 to $1.2 billion range that you've kind of been reiterating since last year? And then just specifically, maybe the margin that you had said would be around 10% is now maybe 9.5%. I know you alluded to a few minutes ago, the B-21 was growing faster. But it\u2019s got to grow a lot faster to drop the margin by 50 basis points. So I was just wondering if you could explore that a little bit more. Thanks very much.\nKathy Warden: Let me start with the first part of your question and Dave will cover the second. As we noted, we identified this risk last year, and we, throughout the year, revisited it on a quarterly basis. There were 2 primary changes in the fourth quarter that both led us to deem it probable loss as well as impacted the value of that loss. First, we significantly reduced our projections for funding related to macroeconomic impacts, as we've talked about a couple of times already. Although we continue to partner with the government to address these impacts. We believe it's prudent in light of the current budget status to reduce those assumptions. And so we did that. The second is we've experienced growth in our cost projection, both in the internal production costs as we've continued to build aircraft as Dave talked about through our negotiations with suppliers. We have learned and built that learning into the forward-looking estimates that we now have in the EAC, so those were the factors. As we've talked about, we did a very detailed look at this EAC in the fourth quarter and had matured and had actual data to reflect on that we did not have at an earlier point.\nDavid Keffer: Let me follow up on the second part of your question because I do think it's an important nuance. The AS business was operating in the mid-10 billions in scale over the past year, it exceeded our original expectations in sales in 2023 and now is projected to exceed them even more significantly compared to where they were a year ago in 2024. We were talking about a flat 2023 and very modest growth in 2024 based off of that mid-tens level. And now we're all the way up into the low 11s. And so that low 11s at a mid-9% margin rate is the same as the mid-to-high 10s at a slightly higher margin rate. We're really focused on driving the dollar volume of operating margin in our Aeronautics business and across our business, it's that return on invested capital, the growth in margin dollars and in free cash flow that results from it, that is really our core focus.\nTodd Ernst: Josh, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our final question. Our final question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi. You may proceed.\nJason Gursky: Hey good morning everybody. Dave, just a clarification question for you to start. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that there were some shifting priorities from the government and the space business that was leading to a deceleration in growth. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on what those shifting priorities might be? And then Kathy, I just wanted to provide you maybe a bit of an open-ended question to kind of wrap all this together here. Just broadly talk about all the risks and opportunities that you see in front of you on the execution side of things. You've obviously got record backlog here and we know about the B-21 risk. But I'm wondering if you could just maybe highlight and wrap this all together, do we have a balanced risk and opportunities portfolio here, we a little bit more overweight risk than we are opportunity? And maybe just kind of dive into a little bit of the details of what you're seeing and maybe what you're all doing to address those issues. Thanks.\nDavid Keffer: Sure. Great questions, Jason. Let me go ahead and start with your original question on the national security space portfolio. As we mentioned, our guidance captures growth and declines in various programs across all of our portfolios, very much including space. In the case of space, as we've noted, there are some shifts in budget priorities. A lot of our customers are having to address budget prioritization, particularly as it relates to 2025 and beyond. With that said, in this particular case, given that it's in the restricted domain, there's not much more we can say about the mission or the program or anything like that. What's important there is that our space sector, and therefore, company guidance accounts for our latest understanding of all the programs in that portfolio and the likely path forward for them. And I think when you look at the space guidance, you see a lot of value creation as they continue to grow the top line. And in this case, now grow margin rates alongside that with lower capital intensity starting in 2025, in particular, you see a lot of improvement in returns on invested capital in the space business, given how much growth they've built in their foundation over the last few years.\nJason Gursky: Kathy?\nKathy Warden: And Jason, I really appreciate the question. I wish I had another hour to discuss it with you, but being respectful of everybody's time, let me just simply say that I see our portfolio and the set of opportunities and risks we have as balanced and consistent with what I have seen in recent years since I stepped into this role. We have a team who has stepped up and provided top line growth, which I believe is industry leading at about 5% on a compound annual basis each of the last four years. We're projecting that again this year. We see the opportunity space is rich, both domestically and internationally. And to the risks that we have in executing this portfolio, while the pandemic certainly made that more challenging for the last couple of years. We're turning the corner. Our overall program performance has not been stronger since I've been at the company, and that's 15 years and going. So I really feel good about how this team is positioned. We now have fully disclosed and taken into the P&L the B-21 risk, which we've been talking about and feel confident that we can now go execute this program. And I am proud of what the team collectively has accomplished across 2023 and look forward to the outlook we have in place for 2024. So with that, I just want to again thank my colleagues at Northrop Grumman for their dedication, both to our country and our company. I also want to thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in April. So Josh, that concludes the call. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you.

Welcome to Northrop Grumman's Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2023 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. My name is Josh, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.\nTodd Ernst: Thanks, Josh. Good morning and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Fourth Quarter 2023 Conference Call. This morning, we'll refer to a presentation that is posted to our IR website. Before we get started, matters discussed on today's call, including guidance and outlooks for 2024 and beyond reflect the company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including those noted in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially. Today's call will include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release. And on the call today are Kathy Warden, our Chair, CEO and President; and Dave Keffer, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?\nKathy Warden: Thanks Todd. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Before discussing our 2023 results, I wanted to take a moment to thank our team for their hard work and dedication to our important mission. Our talented workforce which is now over a 100,000 strong continues to deliver some of the most advanced technologies in the world. These capabilities are used by our customer\u2019s everyday to defend freedom and deter aggression around the globe. The geopolitical landscape has grown even more complex driving continued increases in global security spending. Our strategies has positioned us well to compete and win in this growing market which has translated into accelerating topline growth for Northrop Grumman. Revenue increased by over 7% in 2023 [indiscernible] more than a billion above the midpoint of our original 2023 guidance. In addition, our book-to-bill for the year was 1.14 times, that\u2019s in line with our exceptional four year average. As a result of this award strength, we achieved a new record backlog which now exceeds $84 billion and now provides a healthy foundation for our continued growth. The underlying performance of our company is strong. We generated free cash flow at the high end of our guidance range, and we comfortably exceeded our sales and EPS guidance range, absence of B-21 charge. While we're disappointed that our assessment of conditions for the low rate initial production portion of the B-21 program necessitated this charge in the quarter, we are confident in our ability to deliver on the company's forward outlook, which remains unchanged. We're also proud of the performance of the B-21 team, which continues to execute an unparalleled aircraft development program. As we look forward, we will continue to execute our business strategy, which at its core is based on technology differentiation, a laser focus on performance, and value delivery for our customers and shareholders. To support this strategy, we are prioritizing investment in our capacity and capabilities. In 2023, we invested over $2.9 billion in R&D and CapEx, that's 7.5% of sales, to continue driving innovation and capacity to support our customer mission success. We also delivered over $2.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, representing a return of approximately 125% of our 2023 free cash flow. So now I'll highlight a few examples of progress we've made across the portfolio that further bolster my confidence in our future. Shortly after the close of the fourth quarter, we announced our GEM 63XL solid rocket boosters helped to successfully power ULA\u2019s Vulcan launch vehicle on its first mission. Future Vulcan missions will utilize additional GEM 63XLs in support of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Kuiper, and other ULA customers, providing a significant growth opportunity for our propulsion business. And this is an important milestone because it supports our investment to significantly ramp production capacity of GEM 63s in the coming years. Global demand for our weapons system increased in 2023, and we expect this trend to continue. In this market, we're both a supplier and a prime. We're a supplier of propulsion systems, warheads, fuses, and cannons across a highly diversified customer base, and a prime contractor for predominantly air-to-ground missiles, including AARGM, AARGM-ER, and Stand-in Attack Weapon. Weapons systems currently represents approximately 7% of total revenue, and based on the demands we're seeing, we expect this business to grow faster than the company average for the foreseeable future, with a significant portion of this expansion coming from international customers. In our Mission Systems business, demand remains exceptionally strong, with a 2023 book-to-bill above 1.2 times, the highest of all of our segments. As we've seen in recent years, the restricted portfolio of Mission Systems is a meaningful driver of growth as our customers pursue solutions that enable them to operate inside the decision loop of potential adversaries who are also advancing their computing capabilities. We are helping our customers stay ahead by developing advanced microelectronics, sensors, processors, and secure communication. Our product lines are enabling faster cycles of modernization, positioning our customers with decision advantage in this rapidly advancing technology environment. And we continue to make significant progress on the EMD phase of Sentinel, which is the next generation land-based leg of the strategic triad. We are achieving milestones to mature the design and reduce risk, including key test activities, such as the successful static fire test of the Sentinel Stage 2 solid rocket motor for the missile earlier this month. Last week, the Air Force submitted to Congress a new set of cost estimates for the program, which triggered a Nunn-McCurdy Breach. This in turn launches a review of the program by the Department of Defense, which we expect to be ongoing for the next several months. It's important to note that the cost growth is primarily driven by estimates for the command and launch facility build-out, which is part of the military construction and procurement phases of the program. We and our industry team are continuing to perform on the EMD phase in close partnership with the U.S. Air Force. And we'll work with the government to explore opportunities to reduce costs on the program with a focus on the late 2020s and beyond when the program is expected to move into the procurement phase. And in the fourth quarter, the B-21 entered its flight test phase. This is a major milestone for the program and achieving it within the baseline schedule is a credit to the Northrop Grumman team and our close partnership with the U.S. Air Force over the past several years. Following this milestone, we were awarded the first LRIP lot in the fourth quarter and production is now underway. Let me take a few moments to provide a little more detail on the B-21 charge. The possibility of which we started talking with you about at this time last year. As you know, like all of industry, we and our suppliers have experienced cost pressure from recent global macroeconomic conditions, which are significantly different from the assumptions the team made when bidding these five production lots in 2015. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we again reviewed our estimated profitability on the LRIP phase of the program. And we now believe it is probable each of the first five LRIP lots will be performed at a loss. The charge is largely driven by a change in our assumptions regarding funding to mitigate the impact of macroeconomic disruptions on the LRIP phase of the program and higher projected manufacturing costs that reflect recent supplier negotiations and our experience in completing the first aircraft. The after tax cash impact related to these updates will be spread over a number of years. Importantly, we have absorbed this effect and we have not changed our outlook for free cash flow growth over the next several years. This is a game changing capability that will be of great value to our nation. And we are focused on executing the program in a way that also delivers value to our shareholders over the coming decades. Turning now to the budget environment. Global national security spending is increasing as the U.S. and allies invest in capabilities to deter and defend against aggression. Demand for our capabilities remain strong due to our differentiated portfolio and alignment to customer priorities including the triad, space and weapons. In the U.S., our franchise programs remain well supported by Congress and the Department of Defense. And this gives us confidence in our outlook even in a constrained U.S. budget environment. We are pleased to have an NDAA in place that provides continued support for defense spending. And we're hopeful that Congress will enact appropriations soon. Our guidance assumes we will not have a shutdown or a full year CR, and we're encouraged by the progress we've seen so far towards passing appropriations in the March timeframe. Additionally, we are monitoring progress on supplemental funding and we see opportunities in expanding the industrial base and increasing munitions production in this pending request. Our allies are also increasing their defense spending and we expect our alignment with their needs for aircraft, weapon systems and mission systems to be an additional source of growth. So as we look to the future, we have the right portfolio and team to deliver on our long-term outlook. Our organic sales have grown at a greater than 5% annual rate since 2019. And our guidance calls for continued growth of 4% to 5% in 2024. Segment operating margin dollars are expected to grow at roughly the same rate as sales in 2024. And our 2024 EPS guidance range of $24.45 to $24.85 at the midpoint represents roughly 6% growth excluding the B-21 charge and 11% growth compared to our initial EPS estimates which we provided for in 2023. In addition, the structural building blocks to expand our margins that we outlined in last year's 2Q earnings call, including dissipating macroeconomic headwinds, implementation of productivity and cost savings initiatives and future favorable mix shift remain in place. We are laser focused on performance and bid discipline to drive margin expansion. And importantly, we continue to expect our free cash flow to grow at a double digit rate over the coming years. We are reaffirming our 2024 and 2025 free cash flow outlook. And we've also introduced a 2026 outlook of $3.3 billion at the midpoint. With the businesses generating significant cash flow, we have considerable flexibility in deploying capital to generate value for customers and shareholders. Our top priority remains investing to support our business strategy. And we expect to invest over 7% of sales again in 2024 in capital expenditures and R&D. At the same time, we'll continue to provide strong capital returns to our shareholders. Last month, our board of directors increased our share repurchase authorization by an additional $2.5 billion, and we ended the year with a remaining authorization of $3.6 billion. For 2024, we expect to increase our share repurchases to at least $2 billion. This includes a $1 billion ASR that we plan to initiate in the coming days based on the strong liquidity position with which we entered this year. So when we take these factors, sustainable top-line growth with expanding margins, and couple those with declining capital intensity and lower projected cash taxes, you get a recipe for robust cash flow growth for years to come. So now I'll turn it over to Dave to provide you more details on the segment results, 2024 guidance, and the forward outlook. Dave?\nDave Keffer: Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. We finished the year with strong momentum, enabling us to reaffirm and build upon our favorable forward outlook. I'll start by elaborating on our 2023 results and then provide additional details on our guidance. On the demand side, we ended 2023 with over $84 billion in backlog, a new record for our company. All four of our segments generated a full-year book-to-bill ratio over one-time sales. We also continued to deliver strong top-line results with Q4 sales of $10.6 billion, up 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Full-year sales were even stronger, up over 7% at $39.3 billion, or roughly $300 million higher than our latest guidance. These top-line results were enabled not only by the strong demand environment we're seeing among our customers, but also by our ability to ramp on new programs, expand our workforce, and convert our backlog into sales. Moving to segment results, we generated sales growth in each of our businesses in 2023. Aeronautics sales were up 2% for the year, returning to growth earlier than previously expected. AS growth was driven by higher volume on restricted programs that more than offset declines on mature production programs. DS posted sales growth of 5%, led by higher volume in the weapons and missile defense portfolio. Mission System sales were also up 5%, driven by higher restricted sales on advanced microelectronics programs and higher volume on marine systems programs. And our space business posted another quarter of double-digit top-line growth, with sales up approximately 14% for the year. Nearly 40% of the growth came from Sentinel and NGI, with the rest coming from our broad space portfolio. As Kathy described, our segment margins included a charge for the B-21 program. The charge was primarily driven by the confluence of lower assumptions around macroeconomic disruption funding and higher production cost projections. While the full pre-tax charge had the effect of lowering our segment margins, only $143 million has been recorded as an EAC adjustment, including a $43 million reduction to Q4 sales. The remaining was booked as a contingent liability because the majority of the lots have yet to be awarded. The charge also led to an $82 million benefit in corporate unallocated expense, stemming from a reduction in deferred state taxes. Continuing with our results, slide 5 shows a comparison of our 2023 earnings per share to the guidance we provided in October. Diluted EPS includes a $2.08 unfavorable mark-to-market adjustment from our pension plans and a $7.68 per share impact from the B-21 charge. Absent these items, we would have exceeded the high end of our prior EPS guidance range by over $0.40. Our 2023 mark-to-market adjusted EPS also included significantly less pension income compared to 2022. In total, net pension costs generated a $4.07 per share headwind in 2023. Next, I'll take a few moments to discuss our cash flows. As is our historical pattern, we had an outstanding quarter of cash performance in Q4, generating $1.6 billion in free cash flow. For the full year, our operating cash flow was $3.9 billion, and our free cash flow was $2.1 billion. This result was near the high end of our guidance range and represented free cash flow growth of 30% compared to 2022. Turning to pension results, we generated strong asset returns of roughly 11% in 2023, ahead of our long-term assumptions. The FAS discount rate declined by roughly 40 basis points to 5.15%. Netted together, along with updated census data, this generated a mark-to-market pension expense of $422 million in our GAAP results. Slide 7 in our earnings deck summarizes our pension estimates for the next three years. We continue to expect CAS recoveries to increase from current levels, providing a benefit to our cash flows, but slightly less than prior projections. And we expect a higher level of non-operating FAS pension income in the coming years, driven by our strong asset returns in 2023. In total, our funded status remains superb at nearly 100%, and we continue to project minimal cash pension contributions over the next several years. Turning to 2024, slide 9 in our earnings deck includes our segment-level guidance. Building off the strong top-line results in Q4, we now expect aeronautics sales in the low 11 billions, driven by growth on B-21 and on other programs such as F-35 and E-2D. This is higher than our prior sales estimates for AS, which reflected a flat 2023 and modest growth in 2024. Higher B-21 sales also result in a slightly lower margin rate expectation for AS, which we now project in the mid-9%, netting out to a similar volume of margin dollars compared to prior estimates. DS sales are expected to be roughly $6 billion, up low single digits from 2023. As we mentioned on the Q3 call, DS has really turned the corner on growth through strong demand for weapons and missile defense capabilities. We are optimistic in our ability to convert these opportunities into sustained growth in this business over time, which we expect to be partially offset by modest declines in the sustainment and training portions of the business. Margins are projected to remain strong at DS in the low 12% range. Mission System sales are expected in the low to mid $11 billion range for another year of mid-single digit growth, with margins of roughly 15%. And that space, after expanding sales at a greater than 17% CAGR since 2019, growth is expected to moderate in 2024 with higher segment margins. Space sales are now expected in the mid-to-high $14 billion range, with margins of approximately 9%. The mid-single digit growth rate in space reflects declines in a restricted program due to shifts in government priority, which are more than offset by growth in other parts of the space portfolio. Having built a tremendous backlog in recent years, space now has an opportunity to deliver strong ROI through more measured growth, along with margin expansion and cash generation. At the company level, our guidance reflects growth in sales and segment margin between 4% 5%, absent the B-21 charge, consistent with the outlook we provided on our October call, even after delivering top line upside in Q4. We expect another solid year of bookings, with a book-to-bill around one times. And similar to our cadence over the last few years, we expect sales to ramp throughout the year, with first quarter sales a little less than 24% of our full year estimate. We plan to be in the market soon for new debt issuance to take advantage of the favorable rate environment. The proceeds from the debt issuance will also be used in part to support refinancings of $1.5 billion of notes that are coming due in January of 2025, as well as for general corporate purposes and share repurchases, including the $1 billion ASR we intend to initiate in the coming days. We've reflected this debt issuance in our interest expense guidance, and we'd also expect interest income to contribute to the EPS line, as it did in 2023. We project an effective tax rate of approximately 17% in 2024, consistent with the range we've experienced over the last few years, excluding the mark-to-market adjustment and other unique items. We're coming closer to conclusions on a number of open audit and appeals processes with the IRS, which could have positive or negative effects on book and cash taxes as they're resolved over the next couple of years, and our forward guidance does not include any such adjustments. Similarly, we have not factored any potential changes to R&D tax legislation into our outlook. And as a reminder, our interpretation of current tax law results in a projected 5-year impact from R&D amortization of approximately $2 billion. We will continue to track these matters carefully and provide updates as they progress. In total, we expect our 2024 earnings per share to be between $24.45 and $24.85 on with approximately 148.5 million weighted shares outstanding. Moving to cash, we expect 2024 free cash flow between $2.25 billion and $2.65 billion consistent with our prior outlook. And as we've said before, capital expenditures are expected to remain elevated in 2024 before moderating in 2025 and beyond. Slide 11 in our earnings deck provides an update to our long-term free cash flow outlook to include 2026. We continue to expect our free cash flow to grow at a double-digit rate for several more years with additional growth in the second half of the decade. This expansion will be driven by sustained growth in our business, generating strong operating margin volume and converting those profits into cash. Meanwhile, lower cash taxes, higher CAS recoveries and lower levels of capital spending in the coming years provide additional structural levers to expand our cash flows at a rapid rate. Importantly, these ranges also include the latest estimated cash impacts associated with the B-21 charge. We expect roughly 60% of the charge to affect cash flows through 2026 with the remainder in the following years. Longer-term, we are confident we'll be able to continue to absorb the cash headwinds from B-21 while delivering excellent free cash flows in 2027 and beyond. In closing, I want to thank the entire Northrop Grumman team for their contributions to another great year. The strength of our portfolio and visibility of franchise programs provides us the opportunity to deliver and deploy robust cash flows as we execute on our strategy. And with that, let's open up the call to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you.[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\nKristine Liwag: Hey good morning, Kathy and Dave.\nKathy Warden: Good morning.\nKristine Liwag: Kathy, on the B-21, you've been very clear about the pressures on this program. Ultimately, how much relief did the customer extend to you to offset macro pressures and elevate [ph] portion. And is there still a possibility of future relief?\nKathy Warden: So Kristine, we've been working with the customer. And as we noted, the conversations continue. And last year, in 2023, we and Air Force disclosed that about $60 million of $1.5 billion that Congress appropriated for inflation was allocated to the advanced procurement for Lot 1 on this program. But we have yet to work through what that relief may be in future lots. We have, of course, as we said, updated our assumptions -- and through conversation and the tight budget environment, we've actually lowered the expectations for inflation relief. And so at this point, our focus is on executing this program and finding opportunities in the performance on the program while we continue to work with the government to see if there is any inflation relief opportunity.\nKristine Liwag: Great, thank you. And I\u2019ll keep it to one today. Thank you.\nKathy Warden: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Richard  Safran  (EPA:SAF) with Seaport Global. You may proceed.\nRichard Safran: Kathy, Dave good morning. So I know you're going to get a lot of questions on the B-21, but I thought I'd ask you about to expand on your opening remarks about Sentinel. I thought you might talk a bit more about the actions you're taking at the program back on track. How are you seeing risk on the program right now? And I guess, importantly, what you think the government's level support for the program is given all the headlines and what we've been seeing?\nKathy Warden: Yes. Thanks, Rich. So as the land-based leg of the nuclear triad, Sentinel is a top priority for the Department of Defense. The requirement for the program has been validated numerous times by multiple administrations, and we expect that to be the outcome of this latest review. As the Air Force is reported, the non-operating cost reach on the program is largely due to cost growth in the military construction and procurement segments of the program, and we and the industry team are currently executing on the cost plus EMD phase of the program. That's important because our design work in this phase is helping the Air Force to better estimate the costs of those later phases and due to a number of factors of learning their cost estimates for these later phases have increased, and that's what's driving the non-[indiscernible] breach as the Air Force has said, growth on the EMD would not have triggered the breach. I'll also note that their update captures the inflation since 2020, the last time they did a cost estimate. And we all know that there's been significantly higher inflation than what was assumed at that time. So some of that is what you're also seeing reflected in these latest cost estimates. I mean with that said, though, you asked about our performance on the program, and I'm really pleased to report on the progress that our team has made over the last 3 years while we've been executing on the EMD phase. We've on boarded thousands of engineers. We've matured the system design. We've produced and tested critical hardware in the missile system, as I've outlined earlier on the call. We've also engaged in risk reduction, which is helping to inform the Air Force launch facility modernization and we've done all this while also doing detailed planning for the future phase of the program. I myself have visited the missile fields actually, I was at one last Friday, which is part of why I've got this cold, I brought back. And I met with the Airmen [ph], who have committed themselves to this important mission. So we're all in. We know how important this is our team is partnering closely with the Air Force, and we're going to help them to deliver this essential capability for our nation.\nRichard Safran: Thanks for that. Feel better.\nKathy Warden: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. You may proceed.\nRonald Epstein: Hey good morning everyone. So maybe just jumping back to B-21. Charges like there's some programs have a tendency to accumulate over time. They don't tend to go the other way. How should we think about it as we go forward? I mean, this is what for the first 5 LRIPs, how many LRIPs could there be? And how do we think about the bounds on this? And then maybe one last thing. Is the program NPV positive and if it is, when does it actually become NPV positive, cash flow positive and so on and so forth. If you could just peel back the onion on the program.\nDavid Keffer: Sure. I can go ahead and get started with that. And see if we can address a number of questions you raised. First of all, in terms of the future, we'll continue to update our projections every quarter as we do with all of our large programs. But it's important to note, we have a lot more information today than we did at this time last year, having completed the production in the ground test phase of the first aircraft. We also have the majority of the suppliers now under contract with the remaining in advanced stages of negotiations. We have our latest estimates for productivity and reasonable learning curves that we believe are appropriate based on our historical experience. Of course, we now have one lot under contract, and we'll finalize quantities of the next four lots over time as well. In the economy and inflationary factors have stabilized a bit over the past year, and we'll continue to track those, of course, over time as well. But perhaps most importantly, we're still performing well on this program, which is continuing to provide a critical capability for our customers. In terms of the long-term NPV, we think that's the most important thing is that our customers will get great value from the aircraft. We'll deliver them over time, and that should, over time, also lead to value for the company and our shareholders.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Douglas Harned with Bernstein. You may proceed.\nDouglas Harned: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to go back to the Sentinel program. And when -- what you've described is that I think because that EMD is going well. But when you look at where this is headed and what came out with the Air Force commentary on the Nunn-McCurdy breach. A couple of things that I wanted to understand better. They're talking about potentially a 2-year delay in IOC, they're also -- also you talked about it a little bit, but to understand how much of this breach is due to potential changes in requirements and things that are, in a sense, under your purview versus those that may be under others, including the government customer?\nKathy Warden: Yes. So as you note, there is a delay to IOC, the reason though for the Nunn-McCurdy breach is the cost growth. So oftentimes scheduled delays add costs to the program, that is not the primary contributor. It is, as you noted, design decisions, particularly related to the command and launch requirements that the Air Force has and that affects the deployment in the launch facilities in each of the silos. And so that is what we are working to inform the Air Force decision process on alternatives and ways to reduce those costs and procurement and yet those are Air Force cost estimates, and they include a significant amount of scope that is outside of the industry team's execution. But nonetheless, we will help to inform those discussions if they're ongoing during this review process.\nDouglas Harned: And does the delay in the timing, does this have much effect right now on your outlook for the overall profitability of the program.\nKathy Warden: It does not, Doug, our near-term assumptions on both the ramp of the program relative to sales as well as the profitability of the program are not materially impacted.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. You may proceed.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning everyone. Thank you. Kathy or Dave, maybe if you could just talk about the free cash flow guidance that you're sticking with the 15% CAGR. Just the drivers in terms of top line working capital, Section 174, and the impact of B-21, Dave, I think you said 60% of that over $600 million is through 2026. Is that right? And do we think about Sentinel as a positive cash contributor?\nDavid Keffer: Sure. Thanks for the question, Sheila. I'm happy to dig into that. The strength of the free cash flow outlook we really think of as one of the highlights our report today. And so happy to dig into that in more detail. And I think you heard correctly that 60% of the charge is associated with the period through 2026 from a cash flow perspective. I think importantly, the strength of the broad base of other programs across the business is serving to offset those pressures. And that's what we're seeing in our ability to maintain and build confidence in our multiyear outlook including adding a strong 2026 year to that outlook that continues the double-digit growth trajectory that we expect for the next several years. We had a great finish to 2023 for free cash flow, really strong working capital performance, and that is enabling us to build confidence in our ability to continue to perform at similar levels going forward. As a company, we've put a lot of focus on working capital efficiency, on capital efficiency, on driving cash returns on recent investments and that is clearly showing up in the results and the performance of all of our sectors. We're proud of their performance on cash in Q4 and in the outlooks for 2024 and beyond. And the net effect of all of these factors is that unchanged free cash flow outlook for 2024 and 2025, along with a strong 2026. I'd highlight in terms of what drives that going forward? What's the underlying force as you point out? Certainly, the operations of the business growth in the top line is, first and foremost, with an opportunity for growth at the margin rate line as well that leads to really strong margin dollar volume, which will convert into cash through the strong working capital performance that we expect to continue which is essentially a stable assumption in our outlook. We're not looking for significant additional efficiencies given just how strong we were at the end of 2023. And then as we noted earlier, there are other structural factors that should help as well with CAS pension reimbursement growing slightly over the next few years and cash tax is projected to decline over that same period. So essentially, all of those factors will lead to strong -- strong free cash flow growth outlook for the next several years and beyond.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\nSeth Seifman: Thanks very much. And good morning. I guess a 2-part question about B-21. First was the $143 million EAC in the quarter, is that the extent of the entire anticipated loss on lot 1 and I guess, how do we think about the progression of losses on the various lots? And then second, the fact that this charge includes lots that will be in budgets in 2026 and 2027 and not come under contract for a while and not be worked on for a while. I guess how would you assess the opportunity to maybe ultimately do a little bit better than anticipated here.\nDavid Keffer: Sure. I can start on that, Seth. I think you've read properly into the $143 million EAC adjustment with Lot 1 having been awarded and the other is not yet awarded, that one does take the form of an EAC adjustment. So that $143 million is the lot 1 amount we are currently projecting. And the future progression while we can't get into much detail because that would involve a lot sizes and quantities and other classified details. Clearly, the implication is that there's modest growth from lot 1 to future lots on average. Over time, I think you're thinking of this the right way that our current projections would indicate an average of a couple of hundred million dollars a year of after-tax impact on our -- on the cash line from B-21, and that's, as I referred to a few minutes ago, the headwind we've been able to mitigate through strength in the rest of the business. In terms of your point about opportunity to outperform that over the long-term. Clearly, it is a core focus of our team to continue to drive efficiencies in the learning curves, successful outcomes of our negotiations with suppliers. We continue to engage and partner with our customer to understand macroeconomic impacts on the program and address opportunities for funding of relief, as Kathy mentioned earlier. And so we'll continue to address all of those opportunities. This is something we'll update you in the rest of the Street on over time.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with TD Cowen. You may proceed.\nCai Von Rumohr: Thanks so much. Kathy best wishes to feel better.\nKathy Warden: It sounds like you need those wishes as well.\nCai Von Rumohr: So anyway, so you had the loss on the B-21 kind of it didn't look like a loss couple of quarters ago. You've had your second loss on Halo. This is clearly proving to be an environment where on fixed price contract, there is more risk. Have you changed your strategy regarding how you bid and specifically with reference to Tranche 2 of the tracking satellites because you were on Tranche 1 and you were not on Tranche 2. So have you changed your strategy in terms of how you're bidding? And are there any contracts that you bid before changing your strategy that would still have risk that we're not aware of today?\nKathy Warden: Very insightful question as always, Cai. So when you look back to 2015, when we did B-21, we certainly have changed our view on bidding of contracts where did not have a mature design. It's a point of bid and yet we committed to fixed price options into the future. And we have, to my knowledge, not done that again. And we have passed on some high-profile programs as a result of the risk balance that the customer put forward in the RFP not meeting our standards. We have programs like Halo, which we have certainly learned some additional lessons and are applying those as we move forward. And you note on some very recent bids, we have taken a different approach in looking at firm fixed price, where we've either declined a bit if the customer chose to go fixed price or we've offered a price -- in the case of SDA Tranche 2 that we thought was fair and reasonable and the customer decided not to further negotiate with us. These are things that are going to happen and we're going to remain disciplined. We have plenty of opportunity in this company to grow. We have a strong pipeline of opportunities we're pursuing. And a strong pipeline of opportunities that we believe have the right risk/reward balance with industry.\nCai Von Rumohr: Thanks so much. Feel better.\nKathy Warden: Thank you too.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Gavin Parsons (NYSE:PSN) with UBS. You may proceed.\nGavin Parsons: Thanks, good morning.\nKathy Warden: Good morning.\nGavin Parsons: Maybe just following on Ron's question. Does the B-21 charge contemplate current conditions as they are? Does it have some consideration for future uncertainty in macro or supply chain?\nKathy Warden: With all of our EACs, B-21 included, we do our best based on what we know today to project conditions out into the future. Now with that said, that's difficult to do longer-term that period of performance is. So in this case, we're looking out over greater than 5 years. So as we get into those out years, that's a bit more speculative, but we do incorporate our expectations for changes in everything from material labor pricing to productivity and learning.\nGavin Parsons: Okay. Understood. And Dave, you mentioned the IRS appeal process. Any way to put a range around the possible cash impact on that?\nDavid Keffer: No, I'd refer you to our tax disclosures for more than enough detail on all of those fronts. It's tough to put a range around those things. We're looking forward to getting through processes, as you know, from those disclosures, we have a lot of open years that have yet to be resolved and looking forward to working with the IRS to come to reasonable resolutions there, and we'll update you on any book or tax differences from current reserves as we get there.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.\nScott Deuschle: Hey good morning.\nKathy Warden: Good morning.\nScott Deuschle: Dave, can you give us a sense for the proportion of supplier costs across the 5 LRIP lots that have now been fixed versus what's still open to negotiation?\nDavid Keffer: Sure. As we noted a few moments ago, we're now at a majority of the supplier costs that have been fully negotiated across the LRIP phase. And we're in various stages of negotiation with suppliers for the remainder. So that's one area where we have learn more and progressed in our process compared to where we were a year ago or even a quarter ago.\nScott Deuschle: Okay. Great. And then just as a follow-up, where does the commercial inventory come from in the space business? And is that EBIT headwind mostly gone now? Or is there any more of that left to come in 2024? Thank you.\nDavid Keffer: Sure. Thanks for the question. We had offsetting effects in 2024 and 2023, rather, including Q4 in the commercial elements of the space business. As you know, those are much smaller than and kind of tangential to the core national security space business that we have. In the case of those commercial inventory write-downs, those were related to newer investments in product lines to address burgeoning market opportunity in both the government and commercial elements of the space market. We did see some modest write-downs in various quarters in 2023 associated with those. Those are the types of things you occasionally go through as you make such new investments. So again, not core to the current or future growth story of the space business.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.\nKenneth Herbert: Yes, thank you good morning. Maybe, Kathy, at a high level, I wanted to follow up on your comments earlier regarding sort of the key margin drivers you outlined last year. Specifically more on the cost and productivity efforts and maybe on the mix side, are you seeing incrementally more opportunity now as we think about 2024? And how should we think about sort of the absolute opportunity on those now into this year versus perhaps how much more of a benefit we see in 2025 and beyond.\nKathy Warden: Thanks, Ken. We laid out 3 drivers, the first of which being stabilization in macroeconomics, and we are certainly seeing that in 2024, which is why we see our margin rates this year in line with last with some opportunity for improvement as we go throughout the year. We layer on top of that cost and productivity actions that we are taking in the company, and that will provide some tailwinds in 2024 growing tailwinds into 2025. And the mix shift really is a bit of a longer-term proposition for us. We've talked about that being a shift from cost type to fixed price, where we expect 2023 was really our high watermark for cost type, but a very gradual shift in that mix to fixed price with more of it coming in the latter half of this decade. And then international mix is the other where we don't expect significant international growth in 2024, but we do expect that to step up based on our pipeline and particularly the strong weapons demand outside the U.S. in 2025. That gives you a sense of what will be a tailwind to margin rate win.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.\nMyles Walton: Thanks, good morning. I was wondering, Dave, or Kathy, you previously talked about a $4 billion free cash flow target in 2028, effectively doubling what you've done in 2023. I just want to make sure that's still on the table, despite the charge absorption in that period of time? And then maybe, Kathy, on the margin expansion specific to Aerospace, is that still a 10% margin business? Or do we have to glide slope down a little bit further into 2025, 2026.\nDavid Keffer: Thanks for the question, Myles. Let me kick off with the 2023 free cash flow number. I appreciate the question on that because I think that too is core to the outlook going forward. Yes, we are reaffirming that $4 billion target for 2028. And essentially doubling the level that we were projecting at the midpoint of our 2023 guidance, which was $2 billion. Of course, we exceeded that by $100 million in our final result for 2023. The drivers of that growth are much of what we've talked about already. Certainly, growth in the top line. As Kathy just noted, some of the drivers of margin rate expansion opportunity which leads to margin dollars having an opportunity to exceed the growth rate of our top line through 2028. And importantly, CapEx will moderate during that same period. So we've noted that 2023 and 2024 of these peak years of capital intensity that continues to be our outlook with declines in 2025 and beyond. And then pension and tax will serve as tailwinds during that same period. So that leads you to the $4 billion number. And I think if you look at the 2024 and 2025 numbers we've reiterated for our free cash outlook today and add in that 2026 range, you'll get to that same glide slope that would push you upward toward the $4 billion number by 2028. So those are the building blocks and the way we plan to get there.\nKathy Warden: And Myles, on AS margins, what we're seeing, as Dave noted earlier is that with the B-21 growth being a bit stronger than we had anticipated, AS is stepping up on top line. It is putting some pressure on margin rate, but margin dollars are exactly where we had anticipated they would be coming into 2024, and our guide therefore, remained consistent for AS on a dollar basis, even though we now are looking at more of a mid-9s rate projection. As you go out over time, it's less dependent on what happens with absorbing that lower rate on B-21 and more what happens in terms of other new programs coming into the AS portfolio and the rate at which we will book those programs. So we'll provide you more insight into that over the coming year as we look towards 2025 and beyond.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. You may proceed.\nRobert Spingarn: Hey good morning. Kathy, a few minutes ago, you alluded to international and I wanted to bring up IBCS because it's had some strong demand signals from international customers and thought maybe you could dig into that program a little bit, give us a sense of how large it is in revenue or how -- in 2023 or 2024? And how big it might be, let's say, 5 years from now?\nKathy Warden: It certainly is an area of strength in our portfolio. We've seen strong performance by the team on the U.S. Army program and also as we are deploying in Poland, and we see follow-on opportunities in Poland as a result. We've also, as I\u2019ve spoken about throughout the course of 2023, added a number of additional countries who have expressed interest in the program to the pipeline, and that's what would drive the growth that we anticipate in the 2025 time frame. As you noted, I mentioned international demand. Part of that is weapons part of that is the IBCS portfolio. And then, of course, we have some aircraft and mission system strength in the pipeline for international in 2025 as well. The program itself is growing at a fairly rapid rate, but off of a relatively small it's about $400 million of annual sales. And we expect that to grow, of course, but not a major contributor is the enterprise line for growth.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. You may proceed.\nGeorge Shapiro: Good morning. Kathy, I wanted to ask on the charge for the B-21, what caused it to be bigger than the 0 to $1.2 billion range that you've kind of been reiterating since last year? And then just specifically, maybe the margin that you had said would be around 10% is now maybe 9.5%. I know you alluded to a few minutes ago, the B-21 was growing faster. But it\u2019s got to grow a lot faster to drop the margin by 50 basis points. So I was just wondering if you could explore that a little bit more. Thanks very much.\nKathy Warden: Let me start with the first part of your question and Dave will cover the second. As we noted, we identified this risk last year, and we, throughout the year, revisited it on a quarterly basis. There were 2 primary changes in the fourth quarter that both led us to deem it probable loss as well as impacted the value of that loss. First, we significantly reduced our projections for funding related to macroeconomic impacts, as we've talked about a couple of times already. Although we continue to partner with the government to address these impacts. We believe it's prudent in light of the current budget status to reduce those assumptions. And so we did that. The second is we've experienced growth in our cost projection, both in the internal production costs as we've continued to build aircraft as Dave talked about through our negotiations with suppliers. We have learned and built that learning into the forward-looking estimates that we now have in the EAC, so those were the factors. As we've talked about, we did a very detailed look at this EAC in the fourth quarter and had matured and had actual data to reflect on that we did not have at an earlier point.\nDavid Keffer: Let me follow up on the second part of your question because I do think it's an important nuance. The AS business was operating in the mid-10 billions in scale over the past year, it exceeded our original expectations in sales in 2023 and now is projected to exceed them even more significantly compared to where they were a year ago in 2024. We were talking about a flat 2023 and very modest growth in 2024 based off of that mid-tens level. And now we're all the way up into the low 11s. And so that low 11s at a mid-9% margin rate is the same as the mid-to-high 10s at a slightly higher margin rate. We're really focused on driving the dollar volume of operating margin in our Aeronautics business and across our business, it's that return on invested capital, the growth in margin dollars and in free cash flow that results from it, that is really our core focus.\nTodd Ernst: Josh, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our final question. Our final question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi. You may proceed.\nJason Gursky: Hey good morning everybody. Dave, just a clarification question for you to start. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that there were some shifting priorities from the government and the space business that was leading to a deceleration in growth. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on what those shifting priorities might be? And then Kathy, I just wanted to provide you maybe a bit of an open-ended question to kind of wrap all this together here. Just broadly talk about all the risks and opportunities that you see in front of you on the execution side of things. You've obviously got record backlog here and we know about the B-21 risk. But I'm wondering if you could just maybe highlight and wrap this all together, do we have a balanced risk and opportunities portfolio here, we a little bit more overweight risk than we are opportunity? And maybe just kind of dive into a little bit of the details of what you're seeing and maybe what you're all doing to address those issues. Thanks.\nDavid Keffer: Sure. Great questions, Jason. Let me go ahead and start with your original question on the national security space portfolio. As we mentioned, our guidance captures growth and declines in various programs across all of our portfolios, very much including space. In the case of space, as we've noted, there are some shifts in budget priorities. A lot of our customers are having to address budget prioritization, particularly as it relates to 2025 and beyond. With that said, in this particular case, given that it's in the restricted domain, there's not much more we can say about the mission or the program or anything like that. What's important there is that our space sector, and therefore, company guidance accounts for our latest understanding of all the programs in that portfolio and the likely path forward for them. And I think when you look at the space guidance, you see a lot of value creation as they continue to grow the top line. And in this case, now grow margin rates alongside that with lower capital intensity starting in 2025, in particular, you see a lot of improvement in returns on invested capital in the space business, given how much growth they've built in their foundation over the last few years.\nJason Gursky: Kathy?\nKathy Warden: And Jason, I really appreciate the question. I wish I had another hour to discuss it with you, but being respectful of everybody's time, let me just simply say that I see our portfolio and the set of opportunities and risks we have as balanced and consistent with what I have seen in recent years since I stepped into this role. We have a team who has stepped up and provided top line growth, which I believe is industry leading at about 5% on a compound annual basis each of the last four years. We're projecting that again this year. We see the opportunity space is rich, both domestically and internationally. And to the risks that we have in executing this portfolio, while the pandemic certainly made that more challenging for the last couple of years. We're turning the corner. Our overall program performance has not been stronger since I've been at the company, and that's 15 years and going. So I really feel good about how this team is positioned. We now have fully disclosed and taken into the P&L the B-21 risk, which we've been talking about and feel confident that we can now go execute this program. And I am proud of what the team collectively has accomplished across 2023 and look forward to the outlook we have in place for 2024. So with that, I just want to again thank my colleagues at Northrop Grumman for their dedication, both to our country and our company. I also want to thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in April. So Josh, that concludes the call. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Welcome to Northrop Grumman's Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2023 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. My name is Josh, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.\nTodd Ernst: Thanks, Josh. Good morning and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Fourth Quarter 2023 Conference Call. This morning, we'll refer to a presentation that is posted to our IR website. Before we get started, matters discussed on today's call, including guidance and outlooks for 2024 and beyond reflect the company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including those noted in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially. Today's call will include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release. And on the call today are Kathy Warden, our Chair, CEO and President; and Dave Keffer, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?\nKathy Warden: Thanks Todd. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Before discussing our 2023 results, I wanted to take a moment to thank our team for their hard work and dedication to our important mission. Our talented workforce which is now over a 100,000 strong continues to deliver some of the most advanced technologies in the world. These capabilities are used by our customer\u2019s everyday to defend freedom and deter aggression around the globe. The geopolitical landscape has grown even more complex driving continued increases in global security spending. Our strategies has positioned us well to compete and win in this growing market which has translated into accelerating topline growth for Northrop Grumman. Revenue increased by over 7% in 2023 [indiscernible] more than a billion above the midpoint of our original 2023 guidance. In addition, our book-to-bill for the year was 1.14 times, that\u2019s in line with our exceptional four year average. As a result of this award strength, we achieved a new record backlog which now exceeds $84 billion and now provides a healthy foundation for our continued growth. The underlying performance of our company is strong. We generated free cash flow at the high end of our guidance range, and we comfortably exceeded our sales and EPS guidance range, absence of B-21 charge. While we're disappointed that our assessment of conditions for the low rate initial production portion of the B-21 program necessitated this charge in the quarter, we are confident in our ability to deliver on the company's forward outlook, which remains unchanged. We're also proud of the performance of the B-21 team, which continues to execute an unparalleled aircraft development program. As we look forward, we will continue to execute our business strategy, which at its core is based on technology differentiation, a laser focus on performance, and value delivery for our customers and shareholders. To support this strategy, we are prioritizing investment in our capacity and capabilities. In 2023, we invested over $2.9 billion in R&D and CapEx, that's 7.5% of sales, to continue driving innovation and capacity to support our customer mission success. We also delivered over $2.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, representing a return of approximately 125% of our 2023 free cash flow. So now I'll highlight a few examples of progress we've made across the portfolio that further bolster my confidence in our future. Shortly after the close of the fourth quarter, we announced our GEM 63XL solid rocket boosters helped to successfully power ULA\u2019s Vulcan launch vehicle on its first mission. Future Vulcan missions will utilize additional GEM 63XLs in support of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Kuiper, and other ULA customers, providing a significant growth opportunity for our propulsion business. And this is an important milestone because it supports our investment to significantly ramp production capacity of GEM 63s in the coming years. Global demand for our weapons system increased in 2023, and we expect this trend to continue. In this market, we're both a supplier and a prime. We're a supplier of propulsion systems, warheads, fuses, and cannons across a highly diversified customer base, and a prime contractor for predominantly air-to-ground missiles, including AARGM, AARGM-ER, and Stand-in Attack Weapon. Weapons systems currently represents approximately 7% of total revenue, and based on the demands we're seeing, we expect this business to grow faster than the company average for the foreseeable future, with a significant portion of this expansion coming from international customers. In our Mission Systems business, demand remains exceptionally strong, with a 2023 book-to-bill above 1.2 times, the highest of all of our segments. As we've seen in recent years, the restricted portfolio of Mission Systems is a meaningful driver of growth as our customers pursue solutions that enable them to operate inside the decision loop of potential adversaries who are also advancing their computing capabilities. We are helping our customers stay ahead by developing advanced microelectronics, sensors, processors, and secure communication. Our product lines are enabling faster cycles of modernization, positioning our customers with decision advantage in this rapidly advancing technology environment. And we continue to make significant progress on the EMD phase of Sentinel, which is the next generation land-based leg of the strategic triad. We are achieving milestones to mature the design and reduce risk, including key test activities, such as the successful static fire test of the Sentinel Stage 2 solid rocket motor for the missile earlier this month. Last week, the Air Force submitted to Congress a new set of cost estimates for the program, which triggered a Nunn-McCurdy Breach. This in turn launches a review of the program by the Department of Defense, which we expect to be ongoing for the next several months. It's important to note that the cost growth is primarily driven by estimates for the command and launch facility build-out, which is part of the military construction and procurement phases of the program. We and our industry team are continuing to perform on the EMD phase in close partnership with the U.S. Air Force. And we'll work with the government to explore opportunities to reduce costs on the program with a focus on the late 2020s and beyond when the program is expected to move into the procurement phase. And in the fourth quarter, the B-21 entered its flight test phase. This is a major milestone for the program and achieving it within the baseline schedule is a credit to the Northrop Grumman team and our close partnership with the U.S. Air Force over the past several years. Following this milestone, we were awarded the first LRIP lot in the fourth quarter and production is now underway. Let me take a few moments to provide a little more detail on the B-21 charge. The possibility of which we started talking with you about at this time last year. As you know, like all of industry, we and our suppliers have experienced cost pressure from recent global macroeconomic conditions, which are significantly different from the assumptions the team made when bidding these five production lots in 2015. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we again reviewed our estimated profitability on the LRIP phase of the program. And we now believe it is probable each of the first five LRIP lots will be performed at a loss. The charge is largely driven by a change in our assumptions regarding funding to mitigate the impact of macroeconomic disruptions on the LRIP phase of the program and higher projected manufacturing costs that reflect recent supplier negotiations and our experience in completing the first aircraft. The after tax cash impact related to these updates will be spread over a number of years. Importantly, we have absorbed this effect and we have not changed our outlook for free cash flow growth over the next several years. This is a game changing capability that will be of great value to our nation. And we are focused on executing the program in a way that also delivers value to our shareholders over the coming decades. Turning now to the budget environment. Global national security spending is increasing as the U.S. and allies invest in capabilities to deter and defend against aggression. Demand for our capabilities remain strong due to our differentiated portfolio and alignment to customer priorities including the triad, space and weapons. In the U.S., our franchise programs remain well supported by Congress and the Department of Defense. And this gives us confidence in our outlook even in a constrained U.S. budget environment. We are pleased to have an NDAA in place that provides continued support for defense spending. And we're hopeful that Congress will enact appropriations soon. Our guidance assumes we will not have a shutdown or a full year CR, and we're encouraged by the progress we've seen so far towards passing appropriations in the March timeframe. Additionally, we are monitoring progress on supplemental funding and we see opportunities in expanding the industrial base and increasing munitions production in this pending request. Our allies are also increasing their defense spending and we expect our alignment with their needs for aircraft, weapon systems and mission systems to be an additional source of growth. So as we look to the future, we have the right portfolio and team to deliver on our long-term outlook. Our organic sales have grown at a greater than 5% annual rate since 2019. And our guidance calls for continued growth of 4% to 5% in 2024. Segment operating margin dollars are expected to grow at roughly the same rate as sales in 2024. And our 2024 EPS guidance range of $24.45 to $24.85 at the midpoint represents roughly 6% growth excluding the B-21 charge and 11% growth compared to our initial EPS estimates which we provided for in 2023. In addition, the structural building blocks to expand our margins that we outlined in last year's 2Q earnings call, including dissipating macroeconomic headwinds, implementation of productivity and cost savings initiatives and future favorable mix shift remain in place. We are laser focused on performance and bid discipline to drive margin expansion. And importantly, we continue to expect our free cash flow to grow at a double digit rate over the coming years. We are reaffirming our 2024 and 2025 free cash flow outlook. And we've also introduced a 2026 outlook of $3.3 billion at the midpoint. With the businesses generating significant cash flow, we have considerable flexibility in deploying capital to generate value for customers and shareholders. Our top priority remains investing to support our business strategy. And we expect to invest over 7% of sales again in 2024 in capital expenditures and R&D. At the same time, we'll continue to provide strong capital returns to our shareholders. Last month, our board of directors increased our share repurchase authorization by an additional $2.5 billion, and we ended the year with a remaining authorization of $3.6 billion. For 2024, we expect to increase our share repurchases to at least $2 billion. This includes a $1 billion ASR that we plan to initiate in the coming days based on the strong liquidity position with which we entered this year. So when we take these factors, sustainable top-line growth with expanding margins, and couple those with declining capital intensity and lower projected cash taxes, you get a recipe for robust cash flow growth for years to come. So now I'll turn it over to Dave to provide you more details on the segment results, 2024 guidance, and the forward outlook. Dave?\nDave Keffer: Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. We finished the year with strong momentum, enabling us to reaffirm and build upon our favorable forward outlook. I'll start by elaborating on our 2023 results and then provide additional details on our guidance. On the demand side, we ended 2023 with over $84 billion in backlog, a new record for our company. All four of our segments generated a full-year book-to-bill ratio over one-time sales. We also continued to deliver strong top-line results with Q4 sales of $10.6 billion, up 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Full-year sales were even stronger, up over 7% at $39.3 billion, or roughly $300 million higher than our latest guidance. These top-line results were enabled not only by the strong demand environment we're seeing among our customers, but also by our ability to ramp on new programs, expand our workforce, and convert our backlog into sales. Moving to segment results, we generated sales growth in each of our businesses in 2023. Aeronautics sales were up 2% for the year, returning to growth earlier than previously expected. AS growth was driven by higher volume on restricted programs that more than offset declines on mature production programs. DS posted sales growth of 5%, led by higher volume in the weapons and missile defense portfolio. Mission System sales were also up 5%, driven by higher restricted sales on advanced microelectronics programs and higher volume on marine systems programs. And our space business posted another quarter of double-digit top-line growth, with sales up approximately 14% for the year. Nearly 40% of the growth came from Sentinel and NGI, with the rest coming from our broad space portfolio. As Kathy described, our segment margins included a charge for the B-21 program. The charge was primarily driven by the confluence of lower assumptions around macroeconomic disruption funding and higher production cost projections. While the full pre-tax charge had the effect of lowering our segment margins, only $143 million has been recorded as an EAC adjustment, including a $43 million reduction to Q4 sales. The remaining was booked as a contingent liability because the majority of the lots have yet to be awarded. The charge also led to an $82 million benefit in corporate unallocated expense, stemming from a reduction in deferred state taxes. Continuing with our results, slide 5 shows a comparison of our 2023 earnings per share to the guidance we provided in October. Diluted EPS includes a $2.08 unfavorable mark-to-market adjustment from our pension plans and a $7.68 per share impact from the B-21 charge. Absent these items, we would have exceeded the high end of our prior EPS guidance range by over $0.40. Our 2023 mark-to-market adjusted EPS also included significantly less pension income compared to 2022. In total, net pension costs generated a $4.07 per share headwind in 2023. Next, I'll take a few moments to discuss our cash flows. As is our historical pattern, we had an outstanding quarter of cash performance in Q4, generating $1.6 billion in free cash flow. For the full year, our operating cash flow was $3.9 billion, and our free cash flow was $2.1 billion. This result was near the high end of our guidance range and represented free cash flow growth of 30% compared to 2022. Turning to pension results, we generated strong asset returns of roughly 11% in 2023, ahead of our long-term assumptions. The FAS discount rate declined by roughly 40 basis points to 5.15%. Netted together, along with updated census data, this generated a mark-to-market pension expense of $422 million in our GAAP results. Slide 7 in our earnings deck summarizes our pension estimates for the next three years. We continue to expect CAS recoveries to increase from current levels, providing a benefit to our cash flows, but slightly less than prior projections. And we expect a higher level of non-operating FAS pension income in the coming years, driven by our strong asset returns in 2023. In total, our funded status remains superb at nearly 100%, and we continue to project minimal cash pension contributions over the next several years. Turning to 2024, slide 9 in our earnings deck includes our segment-level guidance. Building off the strong top-line results in Q4, we now expect aeronautics sales in the low 11 billions, driven by growth on B-21 and on other programs such as F-35 and E-2D. This is higher than our prior sales estimates for AS, which reflected a flat 2023 and modest growth in 2024. Higher B-21 sales also result in a slightly lower margin rate expectation for AS, which we now project in the mid-9%, netting out to a similar volume of margin dollars compared to prior estimates. DS sales are expected to be roughly $6 billion, up low single digits from 2023. As we mentioned on the Q3 call, DS has really turned the corner on growth through strong demand for weapons and missile defense capabilities. We are optimistic in our ability to convert these opportunities into sustained growth in this business over time, which we expect to be partially offset by modest declines in the sustainment and training portions of the business. Margins are projected to remain strong at DS in the low 12% range. Mission System sales are expected in the low to mid $11 billion range for another year of mid-single digit growth, with margins of roughly 15%. And that space, after expanding sales at a greater than 17% CAGR since 2019, growth is expected to moderate in 2024 with higher segment margins. Space sales are now expected in the mid-to-high $14 billion range, with margins of approximately 9%. The mid-single digit growth rate in space reflects declines in a restricted program due to shifts in government priority, which are more than offset by growth in other parts of the space portfolio. Having built a tremendous backlog in recent years, space now has an opportunity to deliver strong ROI through more measured growth, along with margin expansion and cash generation. At the company level, our guidance reflects growth in sales and segment margin between 4% 5%, absent the B-21 charge, consistent with the outlook we provided on our October call, even after delivering top line upside in Q4. We expect another solid year of bookings, with a book-to-bill around one times. And similar to our cadence over the last few years, we expect sales to ramp throughout the year, with first quarter sales a little less than 24% of our full year estimate. We plan to be in the market soon for new debt issuance to take advantage of the favorable rate environment. The proceeds from the debt issuance will also be used in part to support refinancings of $1.5 billion of notes that are coming due in January of 2025, as well as for general corporate purposes and share repurchases, including the $1 billion ASR we intend to initiate in the coming days. We've reflected this debt issuance in our interest expense guidance, and we'd also expect interest income to contribute to the EPS line, as it did in 2023. We project an effective tax rate of approximately 17% in 2024, consistent with the range we've experienced over the last few years, excluding the mark-to-market adjustment and other unique items. We're coming closer to conclusions on a number of open audit and appeals processes with the IRS, which could have positive or negative effects on book and cash taxes as they're resolved over the next couple of years, and our forward guidance does not include any such adjustments. Similarly, we have not factored any potential changes to R&D tax legislation into our outlook. And as a reminder, our interpretation of current tax law results in a projected 5-year impact from R&D amortization of approximately $2 billion. We will continue to track these matters carefully and provide updates as they progress. In total, we expect our 2024 earnings per share to be between $24.45 and $24.85 on with approximately 148.5 million weighted shares outstanding. Moving to cash, we expect 2024 free cash flow between $2.25 billion and $2.65 billion consistent with our prior outlook. And as we've said before, capital expenditures are expected to remain elevated in 2024 before moderating in 2025 and beyond. Slide 11 in our earnings deck provides an update to our long-term free cash flow outlook to include 2026. We continue to expect our free cash flow to grow at a double-digit rate for several more years with additional growth in the second half of the decade. This expansion will be driven by sustained growth in our business, generating strong operating margin volume and converting those profits into cash. Meanwhile, lower cash taxes, higher CAS recoveries and lower levels of capital spending in the coming years provide additional structural levers to expand our cash flows at a rapid rate. Importantly, these ranges also include the latest estimated cash impacts associated with the B-21 charge. We expect roughly 60% of the charge to affect cash flows through 2026 with the remainder in the following years. Longer-term, we are confident we'll be able to continue to absorb the cash headwinds from B-21 while delivering excellent free cash flows in 2027 and beyond. In closing, I want to thank the entire Northrop Grumman team for their contributions to another great year. The strength of our portfolio and visibility of franchise programs provides us the opportunity to deliver and deploy robust cash flows as we execute on our strategy. And with that, let's open up the call to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you.[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\nKristine Liwag: Hey good morning, Kathy and Dave.\nKathy Warden: Good morning.\nKristine Liwag: Kathy, on the B-21, you've been very clear about the pressures on this program. Ultimately, how much relief did the customer extend to you to offset macro pressures and elevate [ph] portion. And is there still a possibility of future relief?\nKathy Warden: So Kristine, we've been working with the customer. And as we noted, the conversations continue. And last year, in 2023, we and Air Force disclosed that about $60 million of $1.5 billion that Congress appropriated for inflation was allocated to the advanced procurement for Lot 1 on this program. But we have yet to work through what that relief may be in future lots. We have, of course, as we said, updated our assumptions -- and through conversation and the tight budget environment, we've actually lowered the expectations for inflation relief. And so at this point, our focus is on executing this program and finding opportunities in the performance on the program while we continue to work with the government to see if there is any inflation relief opportunity.\nKristine Liwag: Great, thank you. And I\u2019ll keep it to one today. Thank you.\nKathy Warden: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Richard  Safran  (EPA:SAF) with Seaport Global. You may proceed.\nRichard Safran: Kathy, Dave good morning. So I know you're going to get a lot of questions on the B-21, but I thought I'd ask you about to expand on your opening remarks about Sentinel. I thought you might talk a bit more about the actions you're taking at the program back on track. How are you seeing risk on the program right now? And I guess, importantly, what you think the government's level support for the program is given all the headlines and what we've been seeing?\nKathy Warden: Yes. Thanks, Rich. So as the land-based leg of the nuclear triad, Sentinel is a top priority for the Department of Defense. The requirement for the program has been validated numerous times by multiple administrations, and we expect that to be the outcome of this latest review. As the Air Force is reported, the non-operating cost reach on the program is largely due to cost growth in the military construction and procurement segments of the program, and we and the industry team are currently executing on the cost plus EMD phase of the program. That's important because our design work in this phase is helping the Air Force to better estimate the costs of those later phases and due to a number of factors of learning their cost estimates for these later phases have increased, and that's what's driving the non-[indiscernible] breach as the Air Force has said, growth on the EMD would not have triggered the breach. I'll also note that their update captures the inflation since 2020, the last time they did a cost estimate. And we all know that there's been significantly higher inflation than what was assumed at that time. So some of that is what you're also seeing reflected in these latest cost estimates. I mean with that said, though, you asked about our performance on the program, and I'm really pleased to report on the progress that our team has made over the last 3 years while we've been executing on the EMD phase. We've on boarded thousands of engineers. We've matured the system design. We've produced and tested critical hardware in the missile system, as I've outlined earlier on the call. We've also engaged in risk reduction, which is helping to inform the Air Force launch facility modernization and we've done all this while also doing detailed planning for the future phase of the program. I myself have visited the missile fields actually, I was at one last Friday, which is part of why I've got this cold, I brought back. And I met with the Airmen [ph], who have committed themselves to this important mission. So we're all in. We know how important this is our team is partnering closely with the Air Force, and we're going to help them to deliver this essential capability for our nation.\nRichard Safran: Thanks for that. Feel better.\nKathy Warden: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. You may proceed.\nRonald Epstein: Hey good morning everyone. So maybe just jumping back to B-21. Charges like there's some programs have a tendency to accumulate over time. They don't tend to go the other way. How should we think about it as we go forward? I mean, this is what for the first 5 LRIPs, how many LRIPs could there be? And how do we think about the bounds on this? And then maybe one last thing. Is the program NPV positive and if it is, when does it actually become NPV positive, cash flow positive and so on and so forth. If you could just peel back the onion on the program.\nDavid Keffer: Sure. I can go ahead and get started with that. And see if we can address a number of questions you raised. First of all, in terms of the future, we'll continue to update our projections every quarter as we do with all of our large programs. But it's important to note, we have a lot more information today than we did at this time last year, having completed the production in the ground test phase of the first aircraft. We also have the majority of the suppliers now under contract with the remaining in advanced stages of negotiations. We have our latest estimates for productivity and reasonable learning curves that we believe are appropriate based on our historical experience. Of course, we now have one lot under contract, and we'll finalize quantities of the next four lots over time as well. In the economy and inflationary factors have stabilized a bit over the past year, and we'll continue to track those, of course, over time as well. But perhaps most importantly, we're still performing well on this program, which is continuing to provide a critical capability for our customers. In terms of the long-term NPV, we think that's the most important thing is that our customers will get great value from the aircraft. We'll deliver them over time, and that should, over time, also lead to value for the company and our shareholders.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Douglas Harned with Bernstein. You may proceed.\nDouglas Harned: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to go back to the Sentinel program. And when -- what you've described is that I think because that EMD is going well. But when you look at where this is headed and what came out with the Air Force commentary on the Nunn-McCurdy breach. A couple of things that I wanted to understand better. They're talking about potentially a 2-year delay in IOC, they're also -- also you talked about it a little bit, but to understand how much of this breach is due to potential changes in requirements and things that are, in a sense, under your purview versus those that may be under others, including the government customer?\nKathy Warden: Yes. So as you note, there is a delay to IOC, the reason though for the Nunn-McCurdy breach is the cost growth. So oftentimes scheduled delays add costs to the program, that is not the primary contributor. It is, as you noted, design decisions, particularly related to the command and launch requirements that the Air Force has and that affects the deployment in the launch facilities in each of the silos. And so that is what we are working to inform the Air Force decision process on alternatives and ways to reduce those costs and procurement and yet those are Air Force cost estimates, and they include a significant amount of scope that is outside of the industry team's execution. But nonetheless, we will help to inform those discussions if they're ongoing during this review process.\nDouglas Harned: And does the delay in the timing, does this have much effect right now on your outlook for the overall profitability of the program.\nKathy Warden: It does not, Doug, our near-term assumptions on both the ramp of the program relative to sales as well as the profitability of the program are not materially impacted.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. You may proceed.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning everyone. Thank you. Kathy or Dave, maybe if you could just talk about the free cash flow guidance that you're sticking with the 15% CAGR. Just the drivers in terms of top line working capital, Section 174, and the impact of B-21, Dave, I think you said 60% of that over $600 million is through 2026. Is that right? And do we think about Sentinel as a positive cash contributor?\nDavid Keffer: Sure. Thanks for the question, Sheila. I'm happy to dig into that. The strength of the free cash flow outlook we really think of as one of the highlights our report today. And so happy to dig into that in more detail. And I think you heard correctly that 60% of the charge is associated with the period through 2026 from a cash flow perspective. I think importantly, the strength of the broad base of other programs across the business is serving to offset those pressures. And that's what we're seeing in our ability to maintain and build confidence in our multiyear outlook including adding a strong 2026 year to that outlook that continues the double-digit growth trajectory that we expect for the next several years. We had a great finish to 2023 for free cash flow, really strong working capital performance, and that is enabling us to build confidence in our ability to continue to perform at similar levels going forward. As a company, we've put a lot of focus on working capital efficiency, on capital efficiency, on driving cash returns on recent investments and that is clearly showing up in the results and the performance of all of our sectors. We're proud of their performance on cash in Q4 and in the outlooks for 2024 and beyond. And the net effect of all of these factors is that unchanged free cash flow outlook for 2024 and 2025, along with a strong 2026. I'd highlight in terms of what drives that going forward? What's the underlying force as you point out? Certainly, the operations of the business growth in the top line is, first and foremost, with an opportunity for growth at the margin rate line as well that leads to really strong margin dollar volume, which will convert into cash through the strong working capital performance that we expect to continue which is essentially a stable assumption in our outlook. We're not looking for significant additional efficiencies given just how strong we were at the end of 2023. And then as we noted earlier, there are other structural factors that should help as well with CAS pension reimbursement growing slightly over the next few years and cash tax is projected to decline over that same period. So essentially, all of those factors will lead to strong -- strong free cash flow growth outlook for the next several years and beyond.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\nSeth Seifman: Thanks very much. And good morning. I guess a 2-part question about B-21. First was the $143 million EAC in the quarter, is that the extent of the entire anticipated loss on lot 1 and I guess, how do we think about the progression of losses on the various lots? And then second, the fact that this charge includes lots that will be in budgets in 2026 and 2027 and not come under contract for a while and not be worked on for a while. I guess how would you assess the opportunity to maybe ultimately do a little bit better than anticipated here.\nDavid Keffer: Sure. I can start on that, Seth. I think you've read properly into the $143 million EAC adjustment with Lot 1 having been awarded and the other is not yet awarded, that one does take the form of an EAC adjustment. So that $143 million is the lot 1 amount we are currently projecting. And the future progression while we can't get into much detail because that would involve a lot sizes and quantities and other classified details. Clearly, the implication is that there's modest growth from lot 1 to future lots on average. Over time, I think you're thinking of this the right way that our current projections would indicate an average of a couple of hundred million dollars a year of after-tax impact on our -- on the cash line from B-21, and that's, as I referred to a few minutes ago, the headwind we've been able to mitigate through strength in the rest of the business. In terms of your point about opportunity to outperform that over the long-term. Clearly, it is a core focus of our team to continue to drive efficiencies in the learning curves, successful outcomes of our negotiations with suppliers. We continue to engage and partner with our customer to understand macroeconomic impacts on the program and address opportunities for funding of relief, as Kathy mentioned earlier. And so we'll continue to address all of those opportunities. This is something we'll update you in the rest of the Street on over time.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with TD Cowen. You may proceed.\nCai Von Rumohr: Thanks so much. Kathy best wishes to feel better.\nKathy Warden: It sounds like you need those wishes as well.\nCai Von Rumohr: So anyway, so you had the loss on the B-21 kind of it didn't look like a loss couple of quarters ago. You've had your second loss on Halo. This is clearly proving to be an environment where on fixed price contract, there is more risk. Have you changed your strategy regarding how you bid and specifically with reference to Tranche 2 of the tracking satellites because you were on Tranche 1 and you were not on Tranche 2. So have you changed your strategy in terms of how you're bidding? And are there any contracts that you bid before changing your strategy that would still have risk that we're not aware of today?\nKathy Warden: Very insightful question as always, Cai. So when you look back to 2015, when we did B-21, we certainly have changed our view on bidding of contracts where did not have a mature design. It's a point of bid and yet we committed to fixed price options into the future. And we have, to my knowledge, not done that again. And we have passed on some high-profile programs as a result of the risk balance that the customer put forward in the RFP not meeting our standards. We have programs like Halo, which we have certainly learned some additional lessons and are applying those as we move forward. And you note on some very recent bids, we have taken a different approach in looking at firm fixed price, where we've either declined a bit if the customer chose to go fixed price or we've offered a price -- in the case of SDA Tranche 2 that we thought was fair and reasonable and the customer decided not to further negotiate with us. These are things that are going to happen and we're going to remain disciplined. We have plenty of opportunity in this company to grow. We have a strong pipeline of opportunities we're pursuing. And a strong pipeline of opportunities that we believe have the right risk/reward balance with industry.\nCai Von Rumohr: Thanks so much. Feel better.\nKathy Warden: Thank you too.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Gavin Parsons (NYSE:PSN) with UBS. You may proceed.\nGavin Parsons: Thanks, good morning.\nKathy Warden: Good morning.\nGavin Parsons: Maybe just following on Ron's question. Does the B-21 charge contemplate current conditions as they are? Does it have some consideration for future uncertainty in macro or supply chain?\nKathy Warden: With all of our EACs, B-21 included, we do our best based on what we know today to project conditions out into the future. Now with that said, that's difficult to do longer-term that period of performance is. So in this case, we're looking out over greater than 5 years. So as we get into those out years, that's a bit more speculative, but we do incorporate our expectations for changes in everything from material labor pricing to productivity and learning.\nGavin Parsons: Okay. Understood. And Dave, you mentioned the IRS appeal process. Any way to put a range around the possible cash impact on that?\nDavid Keffer: No, I'd refer you to our tax disclosures for more than enough detail on all of those fronts. It's tough to put a range around those things. We're looking forward to getting through processes, as you know, from those disclosures, we have a lot of open years that have yet to be resolved and looking forward to working with the IRS to come to reasonable resolutions there, and we'll update you on any book or tax differences from current reserves as we get there.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.\nScott Deuschle: Hey good morning.\nKathy Warden: Good morning.\nScott Deuschle: Dave, can you give us a sense for the proportion of supplier costs across the 5 LRIP lots that have now been fixed versus what's still open to negotiation?\nDavid Keffer: Sure. As we noted a few moments ago, we're now at a majority of the supplier costs that have been fully negotiated across the LRIP phase. And we're in various stages of negotiation with suppliers for the remainder. So that's one area where we have learn more and progressed in our process compared to where we were a year ago or even a quarter ago.\nScott Deuschle: Okay. Great. And then just as a follow-up, where does the commercial inventory come from in the space business? And is that EBIT headwind mostly gone now? Or is there any more of that left to come in 2024? Thank you.\nDavid Keffer: Sure. Thanks for the question. We had offsetting effects in 2024 and 2023, rather, including Q4 in the commercial elements of the space business. As you know, those are much smaller than and kind of tangential to the core national security space business that we have. In the case of those commercial inventory write-downs, those were related to newer investments in product lines to address burgeoning market opportunity in both the government and commercial elements of the space market. We did see some modest write-downs in various quarters in 2023 associated with those. Those are the types of things you occasionally go through as you make such new investments. So again, not core to the current or future growth story of the space business.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.\nKenneth Herbert: Yes, thank you good morning. Maybe, Kathy, at a high level, I wanted to follow up on your comments earlier regarding sort of the key margin drivers you outlined last year. Specifically more on the cost and productivity efforts and maybe on the mix side, are you seeing incrementally more opportunity now as we think about 2024? And how should we think about sort of the absolute opportunity on those now into this year versus perhaps how much more of a benefit we see in 2025 and beyond.\nKathy Warden: Thanks, Ken. We laid out 3 drivers, the first of which being stabilization in macroeconomics, and we are certainly seeing that in 2024, which is why we see our margin rates this year in line with last with some opportunity for improvement as we go throughout the year. We layer on top of that cost and productivity actions that we are taking in the company, and that will provide some tailwinds in 2024 growing tailwinds into 2025. And the mix shift really is a bit of a longer-term proposition for us. We've talked about that being a shift from cost type to fixed price, where we expect 2023 was really our high watermark for cost type, but a very gradual shift in that mix to fixed price with more of it coming in the latter half of this decade. And then international mix is the other where we don't expect significant international growth in 2024, but we do expect that to step up based on our pipeline and particularly the strong weapons demand outside the U.S. in 2025. That gives you a sense of what will be a tailwind to margin rate win.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.\nMyles Walton: Thanks, good morning. I was wondering, Dave, or Kathy, you previously talked about a $4 billion free cash flow target in 2028, effectively doubling what you've done in 2023. I just want to make sure that's still on the table, despite the charge absorption in that period of time? And then maybe, Kathy, on the margin expansion specific to Aerospace, is that still a 10% margin business? Or do we have to glide slope down a little bit further into 2025, 2026.\nDavid Keffer: Thanks for the question, Myles. Let me kick off with the 2023 free cash flow number. I appreciate the question on that because I think that too is core to the outlook going forward. Yes, we are reaffirming that $4 billion target for 2028. And essentially doubling the level that we were projecting at the midpoint of our 2023 guidance, which was $2 billion. Of course, we exceeded that by $100 million in our final result for 2023. The drivers of that growth are much of what we've talked about already. Certainly, growth in the top line. As Kathy just noted, some of the drivers of margin rate expansion opportunity which leads to margin dollars having an opportunity to exceed the growth rate of our top line through 2028. And importantly, CapEx will moderate during that same period. So we've noted that 2023 and 2024 of these peak years of capital intensity that continues to be our outlook with declines in 2025 and beyond. And then pension and tax will serve as tailwinds during that same period. So that leads you to the $4 billion number. And I think if you look at the 2024 and 2025 numbers we've reiterated for our free cash outlook today and add in that 2026 range, you'll get to that same glide slope that would push you upward toward the $4 billion number by 2028. So those are the building blocks and the way we plan to get there.\nKathy Warden: And Myles, on AS margins, what we're seeing, as Dave noted earlier is that with the B-21 growth being a bit stronger than we had anticipated, AS is stepping up on top line. It is putting some pressure on margin rate, but margin dollars are exactly where we had anticipated they would be coming into 2024, and our guide therefore, remained consistent for AS on a dollar basis, even though we now are looking at more of a mid-9s rate projection. As you go out over time, it's less dependent on what happens with absorbing that lower rate on B-21 and more what happens in terms of other new programs coming into the AS portfolio and the rate at which we will book those programs. So we'll provide you more insight into that over the coming year as we look towards 2025 and beyond.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. You may proceed.\nRobert Spingarn: Hey good morning. Kathy, a few minutes ago, you alluded to international and I wanted to bring up IBCS because it's had some strong demand signals from international customers and thought maybe you could dig into that program a little bit, give us a sense of how large it is in revenue or how -- in 2023 or 2024? And how big it might be, let's say, 5 years from now?\nKathy Warden: It certainly is an area of strength in our portfolio. We've seen strong performance by the team on the U.S. Army program and also as we are deploying in Poland, and we see follow-on opportunities in Poland as a result. We've also, as I\u2019ve spoken about throughout the course of 2023, added a number of additional countries who have expressed interest in the program to the pipeline, and that's what would drive the growth that we anticipate in the 2025 time frame. As you noted, I mentioned international demand. Part of that is weapons part of that is the IBCS portfolio. And then, of course, we have some aircraft and mission system strength in the pipeline for international in 2025 as well. The program itself is growing at a fairly rapid rate, but off of a relatively small it's about $400 million of annual sales. And we expect that to grow, of course, but not a major contributor is the enterprise line for growth.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. You may proceed.\nGeorge Shapiro: Good morning. Kathy, I wanted to ask on the charge for the B-21, what caused it to be bigger than the 0 to $1.2 billion range that you've kind of been reiterating since last year? And then just specifically, maybe the margin that you had said would be around 10% is now maybe 9.5%. I know you alluded to a few minutes ago, the B-21 was growing faster. But it\u2019s got to grow a lot faster to drop the margin by 50 basis points. So I was just wondering if you could explore that a little bit more. Thanks very much.\nKathy Warden: Let me start with the first part of your question and Dave will cover the second. As we noted, we identified this risk last year, and we, throughout the year, revisited it on a quarterly basis. There were 2 primary changes in the fourth quarter that both led us to deem it probable loss as well as impacted the value of that loss. First, we significantly reduced our projections for funding related to macroeconomic impacts, as we've talked about a couple of times already. Although we continue to partner with the government to address these impacts. We believe it's prudent in light of the current budget status to reduce those assumptions. And so we did that. The second is we've experienced growth in our cost projection, both in the internal production costs as we've continued to build aircraft as Dave talked about through our negotiations with suppliers. We have learned and built that learning into the forward-looking estimates that we now have in the EAC, so those were the factors. As we've talked about, we did a very detailed look at this EAC in the fourth quarter and had matured and had actual data to reflect on that we did not have at an earlier point.\nDavid Keffer: Let me follow up on the second part of your question because I do think it's an important nuance. The AS business was operating in the mid-10 billions in scale over the past year, it exceeded our original expectations in sales in 2023 and now is projected to exceed them even more significantly compared to where they were a year ago in 2024. We were talking about a flat 2023 and very modest growth in 2024 based off of that mid-tens level. And now we're all the way up into the low 11s. And so that low 11s at a mid-9% margin rate is the same as the mid-to-high 10s at a slightly higher margin rate. We're really focused on driving the dollar volume of operating margin in our Aeronautics business and across our business, it's that return on invested capital, the growth in margin dollars and in free cash flow that results from it, that is really our core focus.\nTodd Ernst: Josh, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our final question. Our final question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi. You may proceed.\nJason Gursky: Hey good morning everybody. Dave, just a clarification question for you to start. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that there were some shifting priorities from the government and the space business that was leading to a deceleration in growth. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on what those shifting priorities might be? And then Kathy, I just wanted to provide you maybe a bit of an open-ended question to kind of wrap all this together here. Just broadly talk about all the risks and opportunities that you see in front of you on the execution side of things. You've obviously got record backlog here and we know about the B-21 risk. But I'm wondering if you could just maybe highlight and wrap this all together, do we have a balanced risk and opportunities portfolio here, we a little bit more overweight risk than we are opportunity? And maybe just kind of dive into a little bit of the details of what you're seeing and maybe what you're all doing to address those issues. Thanks.\nDavid Keffer: Sure. Great questions, Jason. Let me go ahead and start with your original question on the national security space portfolio. As we mentioned, our guidance captures growth and declines in various programs across all of our portfolios, very much including space. In the case of space, as we've noted, there are some shifts in budget priorities. A lot of our customers are having to address budget prioritization, particularly as it relates to 2025 and beyond. With that said, in this particular case, given that it's in the restricted domain, there's not much more we can say about the mission or the program or anything like that. What's important there is that our space sector, and therefore, company guidance accounts for our latest understanding of all the programs in that portfolio and the likely path forward for them. And I think when you look at the space guidance, you see a lot of value creation as they continue to grow the top line. And in this case, now grow margin rates alongside that with lower capital intensity starting in 2025, in particular, you see a lot of improvement in returns on invested capital in the space business, given how much growth they've built in their foundation over the last few years.\nJason Gursky: Kathy?\nKathy Warden: And Jason, I really appreciate the question. I wish I had another hour to discuss it with you, but being respectful of everybody's time, let me just simply say that I see our portfolio and the set of opportunities and risks we have as balanced and consistent with what I have seen in recent years since I stepped into this role. We have a team who has stepped up and provided top line growth, which I believe is industry leading at about 5% on a compound annual basis each of the last four years. We're projecting that again this year. We see the opportunity space is rich, both domestically and internationally. And to the risks that we have in executing this portfolio, while the pandemic certainly made that more challenging for the last couple of years. We're turning the corner. Our overall program performance has not been stronger since I've been at the company, and that's 15 years and going. So I really feel good about how this team is positioned. We now have fully disclosed and taken into the P&L the B-21 risk, which we've been talking about and feel confident that we can now go execute this program. And I am proud of what the team collectively has accomplished across 2023 and look forward to the outlook we have in place for 2024. So with that, I just want to again thank my colleagues at Northrop Grumman for their dedication, both to our country and our company. I also want to thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in April. So Josh, that concludes the call. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

        "article_content": " \n\n \n\nBy Tatiana Bautzer and Saeed Azhar\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley's asset management division aims to double its private credit portfolio to $50 billion in the medium term as it gathers funds from large investors to loan out to companies.\nThe bank has invested more than $300 million into the business, which has already gathered about $25 billion in total assets from mainly institutional investors, David Miller, Morgan Stanley's global head of private credit and equity told Reuters in an interview.\n\"The vast majority of new capital will continue to come over the next decade from our institutional clients,\" Miller said. Institutional investors such as sovereign wealth funds and insurance companies hold two thirds of the current portfolio and wealthy individuals account for the rest, he said.\nMiller estimates the broader private credit market has grown as large as $2 trillion. \nThe extension of private credit, of which direct lending is a key part, has increased since the financial crisis as stricter regulations made it more expensive for banks to finance risky loans for debt-ridden companies. \nActivity has surged in the last two years. As banks' capital got tied up in risky loans and interest rates rose, groups of banks were able to provide less financing via traditional syndicated loans. Private lenders such as Ares Management (NYSE:ARES), KKR and Blackstone (NYSE:BX) swept in.\nStill, Wall Street banks have found ways to participate in the new market by gathering money for loans from investors instead of using their own balance sheets. \nGoldman Sachs CEO David Solomon told analysts this month that the bank seeks to raise $40 billion to $50 billion in alternative funds this year. A large chunk of that will be dedicated to private credit, according to a source familiar with the matter.\nJPMorgan has set aside $10 billion of its own capital for private credit, sources familiar with the matter said. It is also seeking capital from outside investors, keen to partner the bank for the segment, one of the sources said.\nJPMorgan declined to comment on its plans.\nWells Fargo teamed up with private equity firm Centerbridge Partners to build a business focused on direct lending to midsize, family-owned and private companies in North America.\nWith market participants increasingly expecting the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, traditional banks are starting to become more competitive in loan markets versus to direct lenders, said Jeff Levin, Morgan Stanley's co-head of North America private credit and head of direct lending. \nLower rates will enable banks to charge companies less in interest for risky loans than private credit participants, who typically charge more. And cheaper borrowing costs are likely to spur more economic activity and dealmaking in general, another factor that could spur activity for banks. \n\"As the syndicated markets activity picks up and the banks become more aggressive, the share of private credit may decline among the large deals, but we will continue to see growth,\" Levin said. \n\nMorgan Stanley's private credit group, housed in its asset management arm, has around 60 bankers that collaborate with investment bankers to originate loans. \nLevin, who oversees a $16 billion private lending portfolio, said the loans are granted to companies ranging from mid-size to large corporations. \n\n \n"

Welcome to Northrop Grumman's Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2023 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. My name is Josh, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.\nTodd Ernst: Thanks, Josh. Good morning and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Fourth Quarter 2023 Conference Call. This morning, we'll refer to a presentation that is posted to our IR website. Before we get started, matters discussed on today's call, including guidance and outlooks for 2024 and beyond reflect the company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including those noted in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially. Today's call will include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release. And on the call today are Kathy Warden, our Chair, CEO and President; and Dave Keffer, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?\nKathy Warden: Thanks Todd. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Before discussing our 2023 results, I wanted to take a moment to thank our team for their hard work and dedication to our important mission. Our talented workforce which is now over a 100,000 strong continues to deliver some of the most advanced technologies in the world. These capabilities are used by our customer\u2019s everyday to defend freedom and deter aggression around the globe. The geopolitical landscape has grown even more complex driving continued increases in global security spending. Our strategies has positioned us well to compete and win in this growing market which has translated into accelerating topline growth for Northrop Grumman. Revenue increased by over 7% in 2023 [indiscernible] more than a billion above the midpoint of our original 2023 guidance. In addition, our book-to-bill for the year was 1.14 times, that\u2019s in line with our exceptional four year average. As a result of this award strength, we achieved a new record backlog which now exceeds $84 billion and now provides a healthy foundation for our continued growth. The underlying performance of our company is strong. We generated free cash flow at the high end of our guidance range, and we comfortably exceeded our sales and EPS guidance range, absence of B-21 charge. While we're disappointed that our assessment of conditions for the low rate initial production portion of the B-21 program necessitated this charge in the quarter, we are confident in our ability to deliver on the company's forward outlook, which remains unchanged. We're also proud of the performance of the B-21 team, which continues to execute an unparalleled aircraft development program. As we look forward, we will continue to execute our business strategy, which at its core is based on technology differentiation, a laser focus on performance, and value delivery for our customers and shareholders. To support this strategy, we are prioritizing investment in our capacity and capabilities. In 2023, we invested over $2.9 billion in R&D and CapEx, that's 7.5% of sales, to continue driving innovation and capacity to support our customer mission success. We also delivered over $2.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, representing a return of approximately 125% of our 2023 free cash flow. So now I'll highlight a few examples of progress we've made across the portfolio that further bolster my confidence in our future. Shortly after the close of the fourth quarter, we announced our GEM 63XL solid rocket boosters helped to successfully power ULA\u2019s Vulcan launch vehicle on its first mission. Future Vulcan missions will utilize additional GEM 63XLs in support of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Kuiper, and other ULA customers, providing a significant growth opportunity for our propulsion business. And this is an important milestone because it supports our investment to significantly ramp production capacity of GEM 63s in the coming years. Global demand for our weapons system increased in 2023, and we expect this trend to continue. In this market, we're both a supplier and a prime. We're a supplier of propulsion systems, warheads, fuses, and cannons across a highly diversified customer base, and a prime contractor for predominantly air-to-ground missiles, including AARGM, AARGM-ER, and Stand-in Attack Weapon. Weapons systems currently represents approximately 7% of total revenue, and based on the demands we're seeing, we expect this business to grow faster than the company average for the foreseeable future, with a significant portion of this expansion coming from international customers. In our Mission Systems business, demand remains exceptionally strong, with a 2023 book-to-bill above 1.2 times, the highest of all of our segments. As we've seen in recent years, the restricted portfolio of Mission Systems is a meaningful driver of growth as our customers pursue solutions that enable them to operate inside the decision loop of potential adversaries who are also advancing their computing capabilities. We are helping our customers stay ahead by developing advanced microelectronics, sensors, processors, and secure communication. Our product lines are enabling faster cycles of modernization, positioning our customers with decision advantage in this rapidly advancing technology environment. And we continue to make significant progress on the EMD phase of Sentinel, which is the next generation land-based leg of the strategic triad. We are achieving milestones to mature the design and reduce risk, including key test activities, such as the successful static fire test of the Sentinel Stage 2 solid rocket motor for the missile earlier this month. Last week, the Air Force submitted to Congress a new set of cost estimates for the program, which triggered a Nunn-McCurdy Breach. This in turn launches a review of the program by the Department of Defense, which we expect to be ongoing for the next several months. It's important to note that the cost growth is primarily driven by estimates for the command and launch facility build-out, which is part of the military construction and procurement phases of the program. We and our industry team are continuing to perform on the EMD phase in close partnership with the U.S. Air Force. And we'll work with the government to explore opportunities to reduce costs on the program with a focus on the late 2020s and beyond when the program is expected to move into the procurement phase. And in the fourth quarter, the B-21 entered its flight test phase. This is a major milestone for the program and achieving it within the baseline schedule is a credit to the Northrop Grumman team and our close partnership with the U.S. Air Force over the past several years. Following this milestone, we were awarded the first LRIP lot in the fourth quarter and production is now underway. Let me take a few moments to provide a little more detail on the B-21 charge. The possibility of which we started talking with you about at this time last year. As you know, like all of industry, we and our suppliers have experienced cost pressure from recent global macroeconomic conditions, which are significantly different from the assumptions the team made when bidding these five production lots in 2015. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we again reviewed our estimated profitability on the LRIP phase of the program. And we now believe it is probable each of the first five LRIP lots will be performed at a loss. The charge is largely driven by a change in our assumptions regarding funding to mitigate the impact of macroeconomic disruptions on the LRIP phase of the program and higher projected manufacturing costs that reflect recent supplier negotiations and our experience in completing the first aircraft. The after tax cash impact related to these updates will be spread over a number of years. Importantly, we have absorbed this effect and we have not changed our outlook for free cash flow growth over the next several years. This is a game changing capability that will be of great value to our nation. And we are focused on executing the program in a way that also delivers value to our shareholders over the coming decades. Turning now to the budget environment. Global national security spending is increasing as the U.S. and allies invest in capabilities to deter and defend against aggression. Demand for our capabilities remain strong due to our differentiated portfolio and alignment to customer priorities including the triad, space and weapons. In the U.S., our franchise programs remain well supported by Congress and the Department of Defense. And this gives us confidence in our outlook even in a constrained U.S. budget environment. We are pleased to have an NDAA in place that provides continued support for defense spending. And we're hopeful that Congress will enact appropriations soon. Our guidance assumes we will not have a shutdown or a full year CR, and we're encouraged by the progress we've seen so far towards passing appropriations in the March timeframe. Additionally, we are monitoring progress on supplemental funding and we see opportunities in expanding the industrial base and increasing munitions production in this pending request. Our allies are also increasing their defense spending and we expect our alignment with their needs for aircraft, weapon systems and mission systems to be an additional source of growth. So as we look to the future, we have the right portfolio and team to deliver on our long-term outlook. Our organic sales have grown at a greater than 5% annual rate since 2019. And our guidance calls for continued growth of 4% to 5% in 2024. Segment operating margin dollars are expected to grow at roughly the same rate as sales in 2024. And our 2024 EPS guidance range of $24.45 to $24.85 at the midpoint represents roughly 6% growth excluding the B-21 charge and 11% growth compared to our initial EPS estimates which we provided for in 2023. In addition, the structural building blocks to expand our margins that we outlined in last year's 2Q earnings call, including dissipating macroeconomic headwinds, implementation of productivity and cost savings initiatives and future favorable mix shift remain in place. We are laser focused on performance and bid discipline to drive margin expansion. And importantly, we continue to expect our free cash flow to grow at a double digit rate over the coming years. We are reaffirming our 2024 and 2025 free cash flow outlook. And we've also introduced a 2026 outlook of $3.3 billion at the midpoint. With the businesses generating significant cash flow, we have considerable flexibility in deploying capital to generate value for customers and shareholders. Our top priority remains investing to support our business strategy. And we expect to invest over 7% of sales again in 2024 in capital expenditures and R&D. At the same time, we'll continue to provide strong capital returns to our shareholders. Last month, our board of directors increased our share repurchase authorization by an additional $2.5 billion, and we ended the year with a remaining authorization of $3.6 billion. For 2024, we expect to increase our share repurchases to at least $2 billion. This includes a $1 billion ASR that we plan to initiate in the coming days based on the strong liquidity position with which we entered this year. So when we take these factors, sustainable top-line growth with expanding margins, and couple those with declining capital intensity and lower projected cash taxes, you get a recipe for robust cash flow growth for years to come. So now I'll turn it over to Dave to provide you more details on the segment results, 2024 guidance, and the forward outlook. Dave?\nDave Keffer: Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. We finished the year with strong momentum, enabling us to reaffirm and build upon our favorable forward outlook. I'll start by elaborating on our 2023 results and then provide additional details on our guidance. On the demand side, we ended 2023 with over $84 billion in backlog, a new record for our company. All four of our segments generated a full-year book-to-bill ratio over one-time sales. We also continued to deliver strong top-line results with Q4 sales of $10.6 billion, up 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Full-year sales were even stronger, up over 7% at $39.3 billion, or roughly $300 million higher than our latest guidance. These top-line results were enabled not only by the strong demand environment we're seeing among our customers, but also by our ability to ramp on new programs, expand our workforce, and convert our backlog into sales. Moving to segment results, we generated sales growth in each of our businesses in 2023. Aeronautics sales were up 2% for the year, returning to growth earlier than previously expected. AS growth was driven by higher volume on restricted programs that more than offset declines on mature production programs. DS posted sales growth of 5%, led by higher volume in the weapons and missile defense portfolio. Mission System sales were also up 5%, driven by higher restricted sales on advanced microelectronics programs and higher volume on marine systems programs. And our space business posted another quarter of double-digit top-line growth, with sales up approximately 14% for the year. Nearly 40% of the growth came from Sentinel and NGI, with the rest coming from our broad space portfolio. As Kathy described, our segment margins included a charge for the B-21 program. The charge was primarily driven by the confluence of lower assumptions around macroeconomic disruption funding and higher production cost projections. While the full pre-tax charge had the effect of lowering our segment margins, only $143 million has been recorded as an EAC adjustment, including a $43 million reduction to Q4 sales. The remaining was booked as a contingent liability because the majority of the lots have yet to be awarded. The charge also led to an $82 million benefit in corporate unallocated expense, stemming from a reduction in deferred state taxes. Continuing with our results, slide 5 shows a comparison of our 2023 earnings per share to the guidance we provided in October. Diluted EPS includes a $2.08 unfavorable mark-to-market adjustment from our pension plans and a $7.68 per share impact from the B-21 charge. Absent these items, we would have exceeded the high end of our prior EPS guidance range by over $0.40. Our 2023 mark-to-market adjusted EPS also included significantly less pension income compared to 2022. In total, net pension costs generated a $4.07 per share headwind in 2023. Next, I'll take a few moments to discuss our cash flows. As is our historical pattern, we had an outstanding quarter of cash performance in Q4, generating $1.6 billion in free cash flow. For the full year, our operating cash flow was $3.9 billion, and our free cash flow was $2.1 billion. This result was near the high end of our guidance range and represented free cash flow growth of 30% compared to 2022. Turning to pension results, we generated strong asset returns of roughly 11% in 2023, ahead of our long-term assumptions. The FAS discount rate declined by roughly 40 basis points to 5.15%. Netted together, along with updated census data, this generated a mark-to-market pension expense of $422 million in our GAAP results. Slide 7 in our earnings deck summarizes our pension estimates for the next three years. We continue to expect CAS recoveries to increase from current levels, providing a benefit to our cash flows, but slightly less than prior projections. And we expect a higher level of non-operating FAS pension income in the coming years, driven by our strong asset returns in 2023. In total, our funded status remains superb at nearly 100%, and we continue to project minimal cash pension contributions over the next several years. Turning to 2024, slide 9 in our earnings deck includes our segment-level guidance. Building off the strong top-line results in Q4, we now expect aeronautics sales in the low 11 billions, driven by growth on B-21 and on other programs such as F-35 and E-2D. This is higher than our prior sales estimates for AS, which reflected a flat 2023 and modest growth in 2024. Higher B-21 sales also result in a slightly lower margin rate expectation for AS, which we now project in the mid-9%, netting out to a similar volume of margin dollars compared to prior estimates. DS sales are expected to be roughly $6 billion, up low single digits from 2023. As we mentioned on the Q3 call, DS has really turned the corner on growth through strong demand for weapons and missile defense capabilities. We are optimistic in our ability to convert these opportunities into sustained growth in this business over time, which we expect to be partially offset by modest declines in the sustainment and training portions of the business. Margins are projected to remain strong at DS in the low 12% range. Mission System sales are expected in the low to mid $11 billion range for another year of mid-single digit growth, with margins of roughly 15%. And that space, after expanding sales at a greater than 17% CAGR since 2019, growth is expected to moderate in 2024 with higher segment margins. Space sales are now expected in the mid-to-high $14 billion range, with margins of approximately 9%. The mid-single digit growth rate in space reflects declines in a restricted program due to shifts in government priority, which are more than offset by growth in other parts of the space portfolio. Having built a tremendous backlog in recent years, space now has an opportunity to deliver strong ROI through more measured growth, along with margin expansion and cash generation. At the company level, our guidance reflects growth in sales and segment margin between 4% 5%, absent the B-21 charge, consistent with the outlook we provided on our October call, even after delivering top line upside in Q4. We expect another solid year of bookings, with a book-to-bill around one times. And similar to our cadence over the last few years, we expect sales to ramp throughout the year, with first quarter sales a little less than 24% of our full year estimate. We plan to be in the market soon for new debt issuance to take advantage of the favorable rate environment. The proceeds from the debt issuance will also be used in part to support refinancings of $1.5 billion of notes that are coming due in January of 2025, as well as for general corporate purposes and share repurchases, including the $1 billion ASR we intend to initiate in the coming days. We've reflected this debt issuance in our interest expense guidance, and we'd also expect interest income to contribute to the EPS line, as it did in 2023. We project an effective tax rate of approximately 17% in 2024, consistent with the range we've experienced over the last few years, excluding the mark-to-market adjustment and other unique items. We're coming closer to conclusions on a number of open audit and appeals processes with the IRS, which could have positive or negative effects on book and cash taxes as they're resolved over the next couple of years, and our forward guidance does not include any such adjustments. Similarly, we have not factored any potential changes to R&D tax legislation into our outlook. And as a reminder, our interpretation of current tax law results in a projected 5-year impact from R&D amortization of approximately $2 billion. We will continue to track these matters carefully and provide updates as they progress. In total, we expect our 2024 earnings per share to be between $24.45 and $24.85 on with approximately 148.5 million weighted shares outstanding. Moving to cash, we expect 2024 free cash flow between $2.25 billion and $2.65 billion consistent with our prior outlook. And as we've said before, capital expenditures are expected to remain elevated in 2024 before moderating in 2025 and beyond. Slide 11 in our earnings deck provides an update to our long-term free cash flow outlook to include 2026. We continue to expect our free cash flow to grow at a double-digit rate for several more years with additional growth in the second half of the decade. This expansion will be driven by sustained growth in our business, generating strong operating margin volume and converting those profits into cash. Meanwhile, lower cash taxes, higher CAS recoveries and lower levels of capital spending in the coming years provide additional structural levers to expand our cash flows at a rapid rate. Importantly, these ranges also include the latest estimated cash impacts associated with the B-21 charge. We expect roughly 60% of the charge to affect cash flows through 2026 with the remainder in the following years. Longer-term, we are confident we'll be able to continue to absorb the cash headwinds from B-21 while delivering excellent free cash flows in 2027 and beyond. In closing, I want to thank the entire Northrop Grumman team for their contributions to another great year. The strength of our portfolio and visibility of franchise programs provides us the opportunity to deliver and deploy robust cash flows as we execute on our strategy. And with that, let's open up the call to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you.[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\nKristine Liwag: Hey good morning, Kathy and Dave.\nKathy Warden: Good morning.\nKristine Liwag: Kathy, on the B-21, you've been very clear about the pressures on this program. Ultimately, how much relief did the customer extend to you to offset macro pressures and elevate [ph] portion. And is there still a possibility of future relief?\nKathy Warden: So Kristine, we've been working with the customer. And as we noted, the conversations continue. And last year, in 2023, we and Air Force disclosed that about $60 million of $1.5 billion that Congress appropriated for inflation was allocated to the advanced procurement for Lot 1 on this program. But we have yet to work through what that relief may be in future lots. We have, of course, as we said, updated our assumptions -- and through conversation and the tight budget environment, we've actually lowered the expectations for inflation relief. And so at this point, our focus is on executing this program and finding opportunities in the performance on the program while we continue to work with the government to see if there is any inflation relief opportunity.\nKristine Liwag: Great, thank you. And I\u2019ll keep it to one today. Thank you.\nKathy Warden: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Richard  Safran  (EPA:SAF) with Seaport Global. You may proceed.\nRichard Safran: Kathy, Dave good morning. So I know you're going to get a lot of questions on the B-21, but I thought I'd ask you about to expand on your opening remarks about Sentinel. I thought you might talk a bit more about the actions you're taking at the program back on track. How are you seeing risk on the program right now? And I guess, importantly, what you think the government's level support for the program is given all the headlines and what we've been seeing?\nKathy Warden: Yes. Thanks, Rich. So as the land-based leg of the nuclear triad, Sentinel is a top priority for the Department of Defense. The requirement for the program has been validated numerous times by multiple administrations, and we expect that to be the outcome of this latest review. As the Air Force is reported, the non-operating cost reach on the program is largely due to cost growth in the military construction and procurement segments of the program, and we and the industry team are currently executing on the cost plus EMD phase of the program. That's important because our design work in this phase is helping the Air Force to better estimate the costs of those later phases and due to a number of factors of learning their cost estimates for these later phases have increased, and that's what's driving the non-[indiscernible] breach as the Air Force has said, growth on the EMD would not have triggered the breach. I'll also note that their update captures the inflation since 2020, the last time they did a cost estimate. And we all know that there's been significantly higher inflation than what was assumed at that time. So some of that is what you're also seeing reflected in these latest cost estimates. I mean with that said, though, you asked about our performance on the program, and I'm really pleased to report on the progress that our team has made over the last 3 years while we've been executing on the EMD phase. We've on boarded thousands of engineers. We've matured the system design. We've produced and tested critical hardware in the missile system, as I've outlined earlier on the call. We've also engaged in risk reduction, which is helping to inform the Air Force launch facility modernization and we've done all this while also doing detailed planning for the future phase of the program. I myself have visited the missile fields actually, I was at one last Friday, which is part of why I've got this cold, I brought back. And I met with the Airmen [ph], who have committed themselves to this important mission. So we're all in. We know how important this is our team is partnering closely with the Air Force, and we're going to help them to deliver this essential capability for our nation.\nRichard Safran: Thanks for that. Feel better.\nKathy Warden: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. You may proceed.\nRonald Epstein: Hey good morning everyone. So maybe just jumping back to B-21. Charges like there's some programs have a tendency to accumulate over time. They don't tend to go the other way. How should we think about it as we go forward? I mean, this is what for the first 5 LRIPs, how many LRIPs could there be? And how do we think about the bounds on this? And then maybe one last thing. Is the program NPV positive and if it is, when does it actually become NPV positive, cash flow positive and so on and so forth. If you could just peel back the onion on the program.\nDavid Keffer: Sure. I can go ahead and get started with that. And see if we can address a number of questions you raised. First of all, in terms of the future, we'll continue to update our projections every quarter as we do with all of our large programs. But it's important to note, we have a lot more information today than we did at this time last year, having completed the production in the ground test phase of the first aircraft. We also have the majority of the suppliers now under contract with the remaining in advanced stages of negotiations. We have our latest estimates for productivity and reasonable learning curves that we believe are appropriate based on our historical experience. Of course, we now have one lot under contract, and we'll finalize quantities of the next four lots over time as well. In the economy and inflationary factors have stabilized a bit over the past year, and we'll continue to track those, of course, over time as well. But perhaps most importantly, we're still performing well on this program, which is continuing to provide a critical capability for our customers. In terms of the long-term NPV, we think that's the most important thing is that our customers will get great value from the aircraft. We'll deliver them over time, and that should, over time, also lead to value for the company and our shareholders.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Douglas Harned with Bernstein. You may proceed.\nDouglas Harned: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to go back to the Sentinel program. And when -- what you've described is that I think because that EMD is going well. But when you look at where this is headed and what came out with the Air Force commentary on the Nunn-McCurdy breach. A couple of things that I wanted to understand better. They're talking about potentially a 2-year delay in IOC, they're also -- also you talked about it a little bit, but to understand how much of this breach is due to potential changes in requirements and things that are, in a sense, under your purview versus those that may be under others, including the government customer?\nKathy Warden: Yes. So as you note, there is a delay to IOC, the reason though for the Nunn-McCurdy breach is the cost growth. So oftentimes scheduled delays add costs to the program, that is not the primary contributor. It is, as you noted, design decisions, particularly related to the command and launch requirements that the Air Force has and that affects the deployment in the launch facilities in each of the silos. And so that is what we are working to inform the Air Force decision process on alternatives and ways to reduce those costs and procurement and yet those are Air Force cost estimates, and they include a significant amount of scope that is outside of the industry team's execution. But nonetheless, we will help to inform those discussions if they're ongoing during this review process.\nDouglas Harned: And does the delay in the timing, does this have much effect right now on your outlook for the overall profitability of the program.\nKathy Warden: It does not, Doug, our near-term assumptions on both the ramp of the program relative to sales as well as the profitability of the program are not materially impacted.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. You may proceed.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning everyone. Thank you. Kathy or Dave, maybe if you could just talk about the free cash flow guidance that you're sticking with the 15% CAGR. Just the drivers in terms of top line working capital, Section 174, and the impact of B-21, Dave, I think you said 60% of that over $600 million is through 2026. Is that right? And do we think about Sentinel as a positive cash contributor?\nDavid Keffer: Sure. Thanks for the question, Sheila. I'm happy to dig into that. The strength of the free cash flow outlook we really think of as one of the highlights our report today. And so happy to dig into that in more detail. And I think you heard correctly that 60% of the charge is associated with the period through 2026 from a cash flow perspective. I think importantly, the strength of the broad base of other programs across the business is serving to offset those pressures. And that's what we're seeing in our ability to maintain and build confidence in our multiyear outlook including adding a strong 2026 year to that outlook that continues the double-digit growth trajectory that we expect for the next several years. We had a great finish to 2023 for free cash flow, really strong working capital performance, and that is enabling us to build confidence in our ability to continue to perform at similar levels going forward. As a company, we've put a lot of focus on working capital efficiency, on capital efficiency, on driving cash returns on recent investments and that is clearly showing up in the results and the performance of all of our sectors. We're proud of their performance on cash in Q4 and in the outlooks for 2024 and beyond. And the net effect of all of these factors is that unchanged free cash flow outlook for 2024 and 2025, along with a strong 2026. I'd highlight in terms of what drives that going forward? What's the underlying force as you point out? Certainly, the operations of the business growth in the top line is, first and foremost, with an opportunity for growth at the margin rate line as well that leads to really strong margin dollar volume, which will convert into cash through the strong working capital performance that we expect to continue which is essentially a stable assumption in our outlook. We're not looking for significant additional efficiencies given just how strong we were at the end of 2023. And then as we noted earlier, there are other structural factors that should help as well with CAS pension reimbursement growing slightly over the next few years and cash tax is projected to decline over that same period. So essentially, all of those factors will lead to strong -- strong free cash flow growth outlook for the next several years and beyond.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\nSeth Seifman: Thanks very much. And good morning. I guess a 2-part question about B-21. First was the $143 million EAC in the quarter, is that the extent of the entire anticipated loss on lot 1 and I guess, how do we think about the progression of losses on the various lots? And then second, the fact that this charge includes lots that will be in budgets in 2026 and 2027 and not come under contract for a while and not be worked on for a while. I guess how would you assess the opportunity to maybe ultimately do a little bit better than anticipated here.\nDavid Keffer: Sure. I can start on that, Seth. I think you've read properly into the $143 million EAC adjustment with Lot 1 having been awarded and the other is not yet awarded, that one does take the form of an EAC adjustment. So that $143 million is the lot 1 amount we are currently projecting. And the future progression while we can't get into much detail because that would involve a lot sizes and quantities and other classified details. Clearly, the implication is that there's modest growth from lot 1 to future lots on average. Over time, I think you're thinking of this the right way that our current projections would indicate an average of a couple of hundred million dollars a year of after-tax impact on our -- on the cash line from B-21, and that's, as I referred to a few minutes ago, the headwind we've been able to mitigate through strength in the rest of the business. In terms of your point about opportunity to outperform that over the long-term. Clearly, it is a core focus of our team to continue to drive efficiencies in the learning curves, successful outcomes of our negotiations with suppliers. We continue to engage and partner with our customer to understand macroeconomic impacts on the program and address opportunities for funding of relief, as Kathy mentioned earlier. And so we'll continue to address all of those opportunities. This is something we'll update you in the rest of the Street on over time.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with TD Cowen. You may proceed.\nCai Von Rumohr: Thanks so much. Kathy best wishes to feel better.\nKathy Warden: It sounds like you need those wishes as well.\nCai Von Rumohr: So anyway, so you had the loss on the B-21 kind of it didn't look like a loss couple of quarters ago. You've had your second loss on Halo. This is clearly proving to be an environment where on fixed price contract, there is more risk. Have you changed your strategy regarding how you bid and specifically with reference to Tranche 2 of the tracking satellites because you were on Tranche 1 and you were not on Tranche 2. So have you changed your strategy in terms of how you're bidding? And are there any contracts that you bid before changing your strategy that would still have risk that we're not aware of today?\nKathy Warden: Very insightful question as always, Cai. So when you look back to 2015, when we did B-21, we certainly have changed our view on bidding of contracts where did not have a mature design. It's a point of bid and yet we committed to fixed price options into the future. And we have, to my knowledge, not done that again. And we have passed on some high-profile programs as a result of the risk balance that the customer put forward in the RFP not meeting our standards. We have programs like Halo, which we have certainly learned some additional lessons and are applying those as we move forward. And you note on some very recent bids, we have taken a different approach in looking at firm fixed price, where we've either declined a bit if the customer chose to go fixed price or we've offered a price -- in the case of SDA Tranche 2 that we thought was fair and reasonable and the customer decided not to further negotiate with us. These are things that are going to happen and we're going to remain disciplined. We have plenty of opportunity in this company to grow. We have a strong pipeline of opportunities we're pursuing. And a strong pipeline of opportunities that we believe have the right risk/reward balance with industry.\nCai Von Rumohr: Thanks so much. Feel better.\nKathy Warden: Thank you too.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Gavin Parsons (NYSE:PSN) with UBS. You may proceed.\nGavin Parsons: Thanks, good morning.\nKathy Warden: Good morning.\nGavin Parsons: Maybe just following on Ron's question. Does the B-21 charge contemplate current conditions as they are? Does it have some consideration for future uncertainty in macro or supply chain?\nKathy Warden: With all of our EACs, B-21 included, we do our best based on what we know today to project conditions out into the future. Now with that said, that's difficult to do longer-term that period of performance is. So in this case, we're looking out over greater than 5 years. So as we get into those out years, that's a bit more speculative, but we do incorporate our expectations for changes in everything from material labor pricing to productivity and learning.\nGavin Parsons: Okay. Understood. And Dave, you mentioned the IRS appeal process. Any way to put a range around the possible cash impact on that?\nDavid Keffer: No, I'd refer you to our tax disclosures for more than enough detail on all of those fronts. It's tough to put a range around those things. We're looking forward to getting through processes, as you know, from those disclosures, we have a lot of open years that have yet to be resolved and looking forward to working with the IRS to come to reasonable resolutions there, and we'll update you on any book or tax differences from current reserves as we get there.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.\nScott Deuschle: Hey good morning.\nKathy Warden: Good morning.\nScott Deuschle: Dave, can you give us a sense for the proportion of supplier costs across the 5 LRIP lots that have now been fixed versus what's still open to negotiation?\nDavid Keffer: Sure. As we noted a few moments ago, we're now at a majority of the supplier costs that have been fully negotiated across the LRIP phase. And we're in various stages of negotiation with suppliers for the remainder. So that's one area where we have learn more and progressed in our process compared to where we were a year ago or even a quarter ago.\nScott Deuschle: Okay. Great. And then just as a follow-up, where does the commercial inventory come from in the space business? And is that EBIT headwind mostly gone now? Or is there any more of that left to come in 2024? Thank you.\nDavid Keffer: Sure. Thanks for the question. We had offsetting effects in 2024 and 2023, rather, including Q4 in the commercial elements of the space business. As you know, those are much smaller than and kind of tangential to the core national security space business that we have. In the case of those commercial inventory write-downs, those were related to newer investments in product lines to address burgeoning market opportunity in both the government and commercial elements of the space market. We did see some modest write-downs in various quarters in 2023 associated with those. Those are the types of things you occasionally go through as you make such new investments. So again, not core to the current or future growth story of the space business.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.\nKenneth Herbert: Yes, thank you good morning. Maybe, Kathy, at a high level, I wanted to follow up on your comments earlier regarding sort of the key margin drivers you outlined last year. Specifically more on the cost and productivity efforts and maybe on the mix side, are you seeing incrementally more opportunity now as we think about 2024? And how should we think about sort of the absolute opportunity on those now into this year versus perhaps how much more of a benefit we see in 2025 and beyond.\nKathy Warden: Thanks, Ken. We laid out 3 drivers, the first of which being stabilization in macroeconomics, and we are certainly seeing that in 2024, which is why we see our margin rates this year in line with last with some opportunity for improvement as we go throughout the year. We layer on top of that cost and productivity actions that we are taking in the company, and that will provide some tailwinds in 2024 growing tailwinds into 2025. And the mix shift really is a bit of a longer-term proposition for us. We've talked about that being a shift from cost type to fixed price, where we expect 2023 was really our high watermark for cost type, but a very gradual shift in that mix to fixed price with more of it coming in the latter half of this decade. And then international mix is the other where we don't expect significant international growth in 2024, but we do expect that to step up based on our pipeline and particularly the strong weapons demand outside the U.S. in 2025. That gives you a sense of what will be a tailwind to margin rate win.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.\nMyles Walton: Thanks, good morning. I was wondering, Dave, or Kathy, you previously talked about a $4 billion free cash flow target in 2028, effectively doubling what you've done in 2023. I just want to make sure that's still on the table, despite the charge absorption in that period of time? And then maybe, Kathy, on the margin expansion specific to Aerospace, is that still a 10% margin business? Or do we have to glide slope down a little bit further into 2025, 2026.\nDavid Keffer: Thanks for the question, Myles. Let me kick off with the 2023 free cash flow number. I appreciate the question on that because I think that too is core to the outlook going forward. Yes, we are reaffirming that $4 billion target for 2028. And essentially doubling the level that we were projecting at the midpoint of our 2023 guidance, which was $2 billion. Of course, we exceeded that by $100 million in our final result for 2023. The drivers of that growth are much of what we've talked about already. Certainly, growth in the top line. As Kathy just noted, some of the drivers of margin rate expansion opportunity which leads to margin dollars having an opportunity to exceed the growth rate of our top line through 2028. And importantly, CapEx will moderate during that same period. So we've noted that 2023 and 2024 of these peak years of capital intensity that continues to be our outlook with declines in 2025 and beyond. And then pension and tax will serve as tailwinds during that same period. So that leads you to the $4 billion number. And I think if you look at the 2024 and 2025 numbers we've reiterated for our free cash outlook today and add in that 2026 range, you'll get to that same glide slope that would push you upward toward the $4 billion number by 2028. So those are the building blocks and the way we plan to get there.\nKathy Warden: And Myles, on AS margins, what we're seeing, as Dave noted earlier is that with the B-21 growth being a bit stronger than we had anticipated, AS is stepping up on top line. It is putting some pressure on margin rate, but margin dollars are exactly where we had anticipated they would be coming into 2024, and our guide therefore, remained consistent for AS on a dollar basis, even though we now are looking at more of a mid-9s rate projection. As you go out over time, it's less dependent on what happens with absorbing that lower rate on B-21 and more what happens in terms of other new programs coming into the AS portfolio and the rate at which we will book those programs. So we'll provide you more insight into that over the coming year as we look towards 2025 and beyond.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. You may proceed.\nRobert Spingarn: Hey good morning. Kathy, a few minutes ago, you alluded to international and I wanted to bring up IBCS because it's had some strong demand signals from international customers and thought maybe you could dig into that program a little bit, give us a sense of how large it is in revenue or how -- in 2023 or 2024? And how big it might be, let's say, 5 years from now?\nKathy Warden: It certainly is an area of strength in our portfolio. We've seen strong performance by the team on the U.S. Army program and also as we are deploying in Poland, and we see follow-on opportunities in Poland as a result. We've also, as I\u2019ve spoken about throughout the course of 2023, added a number of additional countries who have expressed interest in the program to the pipeline, and that's what would drive the growth that we anticipate in the 2025 time frame. As you noted, I mentioned international demand. Part of that is weapons part of that is the IBCS portfolio. And then, of course, we have some aircraft and mission system strength in the pipeline for international in 2025 as well. The program itself is growing at a fairly rapid rate, but off of a relatively small it's about $400 million of annual sales. And we expect that to grow, of course, but not a major contributor is the enterprise line for growth.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. You may proceed.\nGeorge Shapiro: Good morning. Kathy, I wanted to ask on the charge for the B-21, what caused it to be bigger than the 0 to $1.2 billion range that you've kind of been reiterating since last year? And then just specifically, maybe the margin that you had said would be around 10% is now maybe 9.5%. I know you alluded to a few minutes ago, the B-21 was growing faster. But it\u2019s got to grow a lot faster to drop the margin by 50 basis points. So I was just wondering if you could explore that a little bit more. Thanks very much.\nKathy Warden: Let me start with the first part of your question and Dave will cover the second. As we noted, we identified this risk last year, and we, throughout the year, revisited it on a quarterly basis. There were 2 primary changes in the fourth quarter that both led us to deem it probable loss as well as impacted the value of that loss. First, we significantly reduced our projections for funding related to macroeconomic impacts, as we've talked about a couple of times already. Although we continue to partner with the government to address these impacts. We believe it's prudent in light of the current budget status to reduce those assumptions. And so we did that. The second is we've experienced growth in our cost projection, both in the internal production costs as we've continued to build aircraft as Dave talked about through our negotiations with suppliers. We have learned and built that learning into the forward-looking estimates that we now have in the EAC, so those were the factors. As we've talked about, we did a very detailed look at this EAC in the fourth quarter and had matured and had actual data to reflect on that we did not have at an earlier point.\nDavid Keffer: Let me follow up on the second part of your question because I do think it's an important nuance. The AS business was operating in the mid-10 billions in scale over the past year, it exceeded our original expectations in sales in 2023 and now is projected to exceed them even more significantly compared to where they were a year ago in 2024. We were talking about a flat 2023 and very modest growth in 2024 based off of that mid-tens level. And now we're all the way up into the low 11s. And so that low 11s at a mid-9% margin rate is the same as the mid-to-high 10s at a slightly higher margin rate. We're really focused on driving the dollar volume of operating margin in our Aeronautics business and across our business, it's that return on invested capital, the growth in margin dollars and in free cash flow that results from it, that is really our core focus.\nTodd Ernst: Josh, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our final question. Our final question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi. You may proceed.\nJason Gursky: Hey good morning everybody. Dave, just a clarification question for you to start. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that there were some shifting priorities from the government and the space business that was leading to a deceleration in growth. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on what those shifting priorities might be? And then Kathy, I just wanted to provide you maybe a bit of an open-ended question to kind of wrap all this together here. Just broadly talk about all the risks and opportunities that you see in front of you on the execution side of things. You've obviously got record backlog here and we know about the B-21 risk. But I'm wondering if you could just maybe highlight and wrap this all together, do we have a balanced risk and opportunities portfolio here, we a little bit more overweight risk than we are opportunity? And maybe just kind of dive into a little bit of the details of what you're seeing and maybe what you're all doing to address those issues. Thanks.\nDavid Keffer: Sure. Great questions, Jason. Let me go ahead and start with your original question on the national security space portfolio. As we mentioned, our guidance captures growth and declines in various programs across all of our portfolios, very much including space. In the case of space, as we've noted, there are some shifts in budget priorities. A lot of our customers are having to address budget prioritization, particularly as it relates to 2025 and beyond. With that said, in this particular case, given that it's in the restricted domain, there's not much more we can say about the mission or the program or anything like that. What's important there is that our space sector, and therefore, company guidance accounts for our latest understanding of all the programs in that portfolio and the likely path forward for them. And I think when you look at the space guidance, you see a lot of value creation as they continue to grow the top line. And in this case, now grow margin rates alongside that with lower capital intensity starting in 2025, in particular, you see a lot of improvement in returns on invested capital in the space business, given how much growth they've built in their foundation over the last few years.\nJason Gursky: Kathy?\nKathy Warden: And Jason, I really appreciate the question. I wish I had another hour to discuss it with you, but being respectful of everybody's time, let me just simply say that I see our portfolio and the set of opportunities and risks we have as balanced and consistent with what I have seen in recent years since I stepped into this role. We have a team who has stepped up and provided top line growth, which I believe is industry leading at about 5% on a compound annual basis each of the last four years. We're projecting that again this year. We see the opportunity space is rich, both domestically and internationally. And to the risks that we have in executing this portfolio, while the pandemic certainly made that more challenging for the last couple of years. We're turning the corner. Our overall program performance has not been stronger since I've been at the company, and that's 15 years and going. So I really feel good about how this team is positioned. We now have fully disclosed and taken into the P&L the B-21 risk, which we've been talking about and feel confident that we can now go execute this program. And I am proud of what the team collectively has accomplished across 2023 and look forward to the outlook we have in place for 2024. So with that, I just want to again thank my colleagues at Northrop Grumman for their dedication, both to our country and our company. I also want to thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in April. So Josh, that concludes the call. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you.

Welcome to Northrop Grumman's Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2023 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. My name is Josh, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.\nTodd Ernst: Thanks, Josh. Good morning and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Fourth Quarter 2023 Conference Call. This morning, we'll refer to a presentation that is posted to our IR website. Before we get started, matters discussed on today's call, including guidance and outlooks for 2024 and beyond reflect the company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including those noted in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially. Today's call will include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release. And on the call today are Kathy Warden, our Chair, CEO and President; and Dave Keffer, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?\nKathy Warden: Thanks Todd. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Before discussing our 2023 results, I wanted to take a moment to thank our team for their hard work and dedication to our important mission. Our talented workforce which is now over a 100,000 strong continues to deliver some of the most advanced technologies in the world. These capabilities are used by our customer\u2019s everyday to defend freedom and deter aggression around the globe. The geopolitical landscape has grown even more complex driving continued increases in global security spending. Our strategies has positioned us well to compete and win in this growing market which has translated into accelerating topline growth for Northrop Grumman. Revenue increased by over 7% in 2023 [indiscernible] more than a billion above the midpoint of our original 2023 guidance. In addition, our book-to-bill for the year was 1.14 times, that\u2019s in line with our exceptional four year average. As a result of this award strength, we achieved a new record backlog which now exceeds $84 billion and now provides a healthy foundation for our continued growth. The underlying performance of our company is strong. We generated free cash flow at the high end of our guidance range, and we comfortably exceeded our sales and EPS guidance range, absence of B-21 charge. While we're disappointed that our assessment of conditions for the low rate initial production portion of the B-21 program necessitated this charge in the quarter, we are confident in our ability to deliver on the company's forward outlook, which remains unchanged. We're also proud of the performance of the B-21 team, which continues to execute an unparalleled aircraft development program. As we look forward, we will continue to execute our business strategy, which at its core is based on technology differentiation, a laser focus on performance, and value delivery for our customers and shareholders. To support this strategy, we are prioritizing investment in our capacity and capabilities. In 2023, we invested over $2.9 billion in R&D and CapEx, that's 7.5% of sales, to continue driving innovation and capacity to support our customer mission success. We also delivered over $2.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, representing a return of approximately 125% of our 2023 free cash flow. So now I'll highlight a few examples of progress we've made across the portfolio that further bolster my confidence in our future. Shortly after the close of the fourth quarter, we announced our GEM 63XL solid rocket boosters helped to successfully power ULA\u2019s Vulcan launch vehicle on its first mission. Future Vulcan missions will utilize additional GEM 63XLs in support of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Kuiper, and other ULA customers, providing a significant growth opportunity for our propulsion business. And this is an important milestone because it supports our investment to significantly ramp production capacity of GEM 63s in the coming years. Global demand for our weapons system increased in 2023, and we expect this trend to continue. In this market, we're both a supplier and a prime. We're a supplier of propulsion systems, warheads, fuses, and cannons across a highly diversified customer base, and a prime contractor for predominantly air-to-ground missiles, including AARGM, AARGM-ER, and Stand-in Attack Weapon. Weapons systems currently represents approximately 7% of total revenue, and based on the demands we're seeing, we expect this business to grow faster than the company average for the foreseeable future, with a significant portion of this expansion coming from international customers. In our Mission Systems business, demand remains exceptionally strong, with a 2023 book-to-bill above 1.2 times, the highest of all of our segments. As we've seen in recent years, the restricted portfolio of Mission Systems is a meaningful driver of growth as our customers pursue solutions that enable them to operate inside the decision loop of potential adversaries who are also advancing their computing capabilities. We are helping our customers stay ahead by developing advanced microelectronics, sensors, processors, and secure communication. Our product lines are enabling faster cycles of modernization, positioning our customers with decision advantage in this rapidly advancing technology environment. And we continue to make significant progress on the EMD phase of Sentinel, which is the next generation land-based leg of the strategic triad. We are achieving milestones to mature the design and reduce risk, including key test activities, such as the successful static fire test of the Sentinel Stage 2 solid rocket motor for the missile earlier this month. Last week, the Air Force submitted to Congress a new set of cost estimates for the program, which triggered a Nunn-McCurdy Breach. This in turn launches a review of the program by the Department of Defense, which we expect to be ongoing for the next several months. It's important to note that the cost growth is primarily driven by estimates for the command and launch facility build-out, which is part of the military construction and procurement phases of the program. We and our industry team are continuing to perform on the EMD phase in close partnership with the U.S. Air Force. And we'll work with the government to explore opportunities to reduce costs on the program with a focus on the late 2020s and beyond when the program is expected to move into the procurement phase. And in the fourth quarter, the B-21 entered its flight test phase. This is a major milestone for the program and achieving it within the baseline schedule is a credit to the Northrop Grumman team and our close partnership with the U.S. Air Force over the past several years. Following this milestone, we were awarded the first LRIP lot in the fourth quarter and production is now underway. Let me take a few moments to provide a little more detail on the B-21 charge. The possibility of which we started talking with you about at this time last year. As you know, like all of industry, we and our suppliers have experienced cost pressure from recent global macroeconomic conditions, which are significantly different from the assumptions the team made when bidding these five production lots in 2015. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we again reviewed our estimated profitability on the LRIP phase of the program. And we now believe it is probable each of the first five LRIP lots will be performed at a loss. The charge is largely driven by a change in our assumptions regarding funding to mitigate the impact of macroeconomic disruptions on the LRIP phase of the program and higher projected manufacturing costs that reflect recent supplier negotiations and our experience in completing the first aircraft. The after tax cash impact related to these updates will be spread over a number of years. Importantly, we have absorbed this effect and we have not changed our outlook for free cash flow growth over the next several years. This is a game changing capability that will be of great value to our nation. And we are focused on executing the program in a way that also delivers value to our shareholders over the coming decades. Turning now to the budget environment. Global national security spending is increasing as the U.S. and allies invest in capabilities to deter and defend against aggression. Demand for our capabilities remain strong due to our differentiated portfolio and alignment to customer priorities including the triad, space and weapons. In the U.S., our franchise programs remain well supported by Congress and the Department of Defense. And this gives us confidence in our outlook even in a constrained U.S. budget environment. We are pleased to have an NDAA in place that provides continued support for defense spending. And we're hopeful that Congress will enact appropriations soon. Our guidance assumes we will not have a shutdown or a full year CR, and we're encouraged by the progress we've seen so far towards passing appropriations in the March timeframe. Additionally, we are monitoring progress on supplemental funding and we see opportunities in expanding the industrial base and increasing munitions production in this pending request. Our allies are also increasing their defense spending and we expect our alignment with their needs for aircraft, weapon systems and mission systems to be an additional source of growth. So as we look to the future, we have the right portfolio and team to deliver on our long-term outlook. Our organic sales have grown at a greater than 5% annual rate since 2019. And our guidance calls for continued growth of 4% to 5% in 2024. Segment operating margin dollars are expected to grow at roughly the same rate as sales in 2024. And our 2024 EPS guidance range of $24.45 to $24.85 at the midpoint represents roughly 6% growth excluding the B-21 charge and 11% growth compared to our initial EPS estimates which we provided for in 2023. In addition, the structural building blocks to expand our margins that we outlined in last year's 2Q earnings call, including dissipating macroeconomic headwinds, implementation of productivity and cost savings initiatives and future favorable mix shift remain in place. We are laser focused on performance and bid discipline to drive margin expansion. And importantly, we continue to expect our free cash flow to grow at a double digit rate over the coming years. We are reaffirming our 2024 and 2025 free cash flow outlook. And we've also introduced a 2026 outlook of $3.3 billion at the midpoint. With the businesses generating significant cash flow, we have considerable flexibility in deploying capital to generate value for customers and shareholders. Our top priority remains investing to support our business strategy. And we expect to invest over 7% of sales again in 2024 in capital expenditures and R&D. At the same time, we'll continue to provide strong capital returns to our shareholders. Last month, our board of directors increased our share repurchase authorization by an additional $2.5 billion, and we ended the year with a remaining authorization of $3.6 billion. For 2024, we expect to increase our share repurchases to at least $2 billion. This includes a $1 billion ASR that we plan to initiate in the coming days based on the strong liquidity position with which we entered this year. So when we take these factors, sustainable top-line growth with expanding margins, and couple those with declining capital intensity and lower projected cash taxes, you get a recipe for robust cash flow growth for years to come. So now I'll turn it over to Dave to provide you more details on the segment results, 2024 guidance, and the forward outlook. Dave?\nDave Keffer: Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. We finished the year with strong momentum, enabling us to reaffirm and build upon our favorable forward outlook. I'll start by elaborating on our 2023 results and then provide additional details on our guidance. On the demand side, we ended 2023 with over $84 billion in backlog, a new record for our company. All four of our segments generated a full-year book-to-bill ratio over one-time sales. We also continued to deliver strong top-line results with Q4 sales of $10.6 billion, up 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Full-year sales were even stronger, up over 7% at $39.3 billion, or roughly $300 million higher than our latest guidance. These top-line results were enabled not only by the strong demand environment we're seeing among our customers, but also by our ability to ramp on new programs, expand our workforce, and convert our backlog into sales. Moving to segment results, we generated sales growth in each of our businesses in 2023. Aeronautics sales were up 2% for the year, returning to growth earlier than previously expected. AS growth was driven by higher volume on restricted programs that more than offset declines on mature production programs. DS posted sales growth of 5%, led by higher volume in the weapons and missile defense portfolio. Mission System sales were also up 5%, driven by higher restricted sales on advanced microelectronics programs and higher volume on marine systems programs. And our space business posted another quarter of double-digit top-line growth, with sales up approximately 14% for the year. Nearly 40% of the growth came from Sentinel and NGI, with the rest coming from our broad space portfolio. As Kathy described, our segment margins included a charge for the B-21 program. The charge was primarily driven by the confluence of lower assumptions around macroeconomic disruption funding and higher production cost projections. While the full pre-tax charge had the effect of lowering our segment margins, only $143 million has been recorded as an EAC adjustment, including a $43 million reduction to Q4 sales. The remaining was booked as a contingent liability because the majority of the lots have yet to be awarded. The charge also led to an $82 million benefit in corporate unallocated expense, stemming from a reduction in deferred state taxes. Continuing with our results, slide 5 shows a comparison of our 2023 earnings per share to the guidance we provided in October. Diluted EPS includes a $2.08 unfavorable mark-to-market adjustment from our pension plans and a $7.68 per share impact from the B-21 charge. Absent these items, we would have exceeded the high end of our prior EPS guidance range by over $0.40. Our 2023 mark-to-market adjusted EPS also included significantly less pension income compared to 2022. In total, net pension costs generated a $4.07 per share headwind in 2023. Next, I'll take a few moments to discuss our cash flows. As is our historical pattern, we had an outstanding quarter of cash performance in Q4, generating $1.6 billion in free cash flow. For the full year, our operating cash flow was $3.9 billion, and our free cash flow was $2.1 billion. This result was near the high end of our guidance range and represented free cash flow growth of 30% compared to 2022. Turning to pension results, we generated strong asset returns of roughly 11% in 2023, ahead of our long-term assumptions. The FAS discount rate declined by roughly 40 basis points to 5.15%. Netted together, along with updated census data, this generated a mark-to-market pension expense of $422 million in our GAAP results. Slide 7 in our earnings deck summarizes our pension estimates for the next three years. We continue to expect CAS recoveries to increase from current levels, providing a benefit to our cash flows, but slightly less than prior projections. And we expect a higher level of non-operating FAS pension income in the coming years, driven by our strong asset returns in 2023. In total, our funded status remains superb at nearly 100%, and we continue to project minimal cash pension contributions over the next several years. Turning to 2024, slide 9 in our earnings deck includes our segment-level guidance. Building off the strong top-line results in Q4, we now expect aeronautics sales in the low 11 billions, driven by growth on B-21 and on other programs such as F-35 and E-2D. This is higher than our prior sales estimates for AS, which reflected a flat 2023 and modest growth in 2024. Higher B-21 sales also result in a slightly lower margin rate expectation for AS, which we now project in the mid-9%, netting out to a similar volume of margin dollars compared to prior estimates. DS sales are expected to be roughly $6 billion, up low single digits from 2023. As we mentioned on the Q3 call, DS has really turned the corner on growth through strong demand for weapons and missile defense capabilities. We are optimistic in our ability to convert these opportunities into sustained growth in this business over time, which we expect to be partially offset by modest declines in the sustainment and training portions of the business. Margins are projected to remain strong at DS in the low 12% range. Mission System sales are expected in the low to mid $11 billion range for another year of mid-single digit growth, with margins of roughly 15%. And that space, after expanding sales at a greater than 17% CAGR since 2019, growth is expected to moderate in 2024 with higher segment margins. Space sales are now expected in the mid-to-high $14 billion range, with margins of approximately 9%. The mid-single digit growth rate in space reflects declines in a restricted program due to shifts in government priority, which are more than offset by growth in other parts of the space portfolio. Having built a tremendous backlog in recent years, space now has an opportunity to deliver strong ROI through more measured growth, along with margin expansion and cash generation. At the company level, our guidance reflects growth in sales and segment margin between 4% 5%, absent the B-21 charge, consistent with the outlook we provided on our October call, even after delivering top line upside in Q4. We expect another solid year of bookings, with a book-to-bill around one times. And similar to our cadence over the last few years, we expect sales to ramp throughout the year, with first quarter sales a little less than 24% of our full year estimate. We plan to be in the market soon for new debt issuance to take advantage of the favorable rate environment. The proceeds from the debt issuance will also be used in part to support refinancings of $1.5 billion of notes that are coming due in January of 2025, as well as for general corporate purposes and share repurchases, including the $1 billion ASR we intend to initiate in the coming days. We've reflected this debt issuance in our interest expense guidance, and we'd also expect interest income to contribute to the EPS line, as it did in 2023. We project an effective tax rate of approximately 17% in 2024, consistent with the range we've experienced over the last few years, excluding the mark-to-market adjustment and other unique items. We're coming closer to conclusions on a number of open audit and appeals processes with the IRS, which could have positive or negative effects on book and cash taxes as they're resolved over the next couple of years, and our forward guidance does not include any such adjustments. Similarly, we have not factored any potential changes to R&D tax legislation into our outlook. And as a reminder, our interpretation of current tax law results in a projected 5-year impact from R&D amortization of approximately $2 billion. We will continue to track these matters carefully and provide updates as they progress. In total, we expect our 2024 earnings per share to be between $24.45 and $24.85 on with approximately 148.5 million weighted shares outstanding. Moving to cash, we expect 2024 free cash flow between $2.25 billion and $2.65 billion consistent with our prior outlook. And as we've said before, capital expenditures are expected to remain elevated in 2024 before moderating in 2025 and beyond. Slide 11 in our earnings deck provides an update to our long-term free cash flow outlook to include 2026. We continue to expect our free cash flow to grow at a double-digit rate for several more years with additional growth in the second half of the decade. This expansion will be driven by sustained growth in our business, generating strong operating margin volume and converting those profits into cash. Meanwhile, lower cash taxes, higher CAS recoveries and lower levels of capital spending in the coming years provide additional structural levers to expand our cash flows at a rapid rate. Importantly, these ranges also include the latest estimated cash impacts associated with the B-21 charge. We expect roughly 60% of the charge to affect cash flows through 2026 with the remainder in the following years. Longer-term, we are confident we'll be able to continue to absorb the cash headwinds from B-21 while delivering excellent free cash flows in 2027 and beyond. In closing, I want to thank the entire Northrop Grumman team for their contributions to another great year. The strength of our portfolio and visibility of franchise programs provides us the opportunity to deliver and deploy robust cash flows as we execute on our strategy. And with that, let's open up the call to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you.[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\nKristine Liwag: Hey good morning, Kathy and Dave.\nKathy Warden: Good morning.\nKristine Liwag: Kathy, on the B-21, you've been very clear about the pressures on this program. Ultimately, how much relief did the customer extend to you to offset macro pressures and elevate [ph] portion. And is there still a possibility of future relief?\nKathy Warden: So Kristine, we've been working with the customer. And as we noted, the conversations continue. And last year, in 2023, we and Air Force disclosed that about $60 million of $1.5 billion that Congress appropriated for inflation was allocated to the advanced procurement for Lot 1 on this program. But we have yet to work through what that relief may be in future lots. We have, of course, as we said, updated our assumptions -- and through conversation and the tight budget environment, we've actually lowered the expectations for inflation relief. And so at this point, our focus is on executing this program and finding opportunities in the performance on the program while we continue to work with the government to see if there is any inflation relief opportunity.\nKristine Liwag: Great, thank you. And I\u2019ll keep it to one today. Thank you.\nKathy Warden: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Richard  Safran  (EPA:SAF) with Seaport Global. You may proceed.\nRichard Safran: Kathy, Dave good morning. So I know you're going to get a lot of questions on the B-21, but I thought I'd ask you about to expand on your opening remarks about Sentinel. I thought you might talk a bit more about the actions you're taking at the program back on track. How are you seeing risk on the program right now? And I guess, importantly, what you think the government's level support for the program is given all the headlines and what we've been seeing?\nKathy Warden: Yes. Thanks, Rich. So as the land-based leg of the nuclear triad, Sentinel is a top priority for the Department of Defense. The requirement for the program has been validated numerous times by multiple administrations, and we expect that to be the outcome of this latest review. As the Air Force is reported, the non-operating cost reach on the program is largely due to cost growth in the military construction and procurement segments of the program, and we and the industry team are currently executing on the cost plus EMD phase of the program. That's important because our design work in this phase is helping the Air Force to better estimate the costs of those later phases and due to a number of factors of learning their cost estimates for these later phases have increased, and that's what's driving the non-[indiscernible] breach as the Air Force has said, growth on the EMD would not have triggered the breach. I'll also note that their update captures the inflation since 2020, the last time they did a cost estimate. And we all know that there's been significantly higher inflation than what was assumed at that time. So some of that is what you're also seeing reflected in these latest cost estimates. I mean with that said, though, you asked about our performance on the program, and I'm really pleased to report on the progress that our team has made over the last 3 years while we've been executing on the EMD phase. We've on boarded thousands of engineers. We've matured the system design. We've produced and tested critical hardware in the missile system, as I've outlined earlier on the call. We've also engaged in risk reduction, which is helping to inform the Air Force launch facility modernization and we've done all this while also doing detailed planning for the future phase of the program. I myself have visited the missile fields actually, I was at one last Friday, which is part of why I've got this cold, I brought back. And I met with the Airmen [ph], who have committed themselves to this important mission. So we're all in. We know how important this is our team is partnering closely with the Air Force, and we're going to help them to deliver this essential capability for our nation.\nRichard Safran: Thanks for that. Feel better.\nKathy Warden: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. You may proceed.\nRonald Epstein: Hey good morning everyone. So maybe just jumping back to B-21. Charges like there's some programs have a tendency to accumulate over time. They don't tend to go the other way. How should we think about it as we go forward? I mean, this is what for the first 5 LRIPs, how many LRIPs could there be? And how do we think about the bounds on this? And then maybe one last thing. Is the program NPV positive and if it is, when does it actually become NPV positive, cash flow positive and so on and so forth. If you could just peel back the onion on the program.\nDavid Keffer: Sure. I can go ahead and get started with that. And see if we can address a number of questions you raised. First of all, in terms of the future, we'll continue to update our projections every quarter as we do with all of our large programs. But it's important to note, we have a lot more information today than we did at this time last year, having completed the production in the ground test phase of the first aircraft. We also have the majority of the suppliers now under contract with the remaining in advanced stages of negotiations. We have our latest estimates for productivity and reasonable learning curves that we believe are appropriate based on our historical experience. Of course, we now have one lot under contract, and we'll finalize quantities of the next four lots over time as well. In the economy and inflationary factors have stabilized a bit over the past year, and we'll continue to track those, of course, over time as well. But perhaps most importantly, we're still performing well on this program, which is continuing to provide a critical capability for our customers. In terms of the long-term NPV, we think that's the most important thing is that our customers will get great value from the aircraft. We'll deliver them over time, and that should, over time, also lead to value for the company and our shareholders.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Douglas Harned with Bernstein. You may proceed.\nDouglas Harned: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to go back to the Sentinel program. And when -- what you've described is that I think because that EMD is going well. But when you look at where this is headed and what came out with the Air Force commentary on the Nunn-McCurdy breach. A couple of things that I wanted to understand better. They're talking about potentially a 2-year delay in IOC, they're also -- also you talked about it a little bit, but to understand how much of this breach is due to potential changes in requirements and things that are, in a sense, under your purview versus those that may be under others, including the government customer?\nKathy Warden: Yes. So as you note, there is a delay to IOC, the reason though for the Nunn-McCurdy breach is the cost growth. So oftentimes scheduled delays add costs to the program, that is not the primary contributor. It is, as you noted, design decisions, particularly related to the command and launch requirements that the Air Force has and that affects the deployment in the launch facilities in each of the silos. And so that is what we are working to inform the Air Force decision process on alternatives and ways to reduce those costs and procurement and yet those are Air Force cost estimates, and they include a significant amount of scope that is outside of the industry team's execution. But nonetheless, we will help to inform those discussions if they're ongoing during this review process.\nDouglas Harned: And does the delay in the timing, does this have much effect right now on your outlook for the overall profitability of the program.\nKathy Warden: It does not, Doug, our near-term assumptions on both the ramp of the program relative to sales as well as the profitability of the program are not materially impacted.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. You may proceed.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning everyone. Thank you. Kathy or Dave, maybe if you could just talk about the free cash flow guidance that you're sticking with the 15% CAGR. Just the drivers in terms of top line working capital, Section 174, and the impact of B-21, Dave, I think you said 60% of that over $600 million is through 2026. Is that right? And do we think about Sentinel as a positive cash contributor?\nDavid Keffer: Sure. Thanks for the question, Sheila. I'm happy to dig into that. The strength of the free cash flow outlook we really think of as one of the highlights our report today. And so happy to dig into that in more detail. And I think you heard correctly that 60% of the charge is associated with the period through 2026 from a cash flow perspective. I think importantly, the strength of the broad base of other programs across the business is serving to offset those pressures. And that's what we're seeing in our ability to maintain and build confidence in our multiyear outlook including adding a strong 2026 year to that outlook that continues the double-digit growth trajectory that we expect for the next several years. We had a great finish to 2023 for free cash flow, really strong working capital performance, and that is enabling us to build confidence in our ability to continue to perform at similar levels going forward. As a company, we've put a lot of focus on working capital efficiency, on capital efficiency, on driving cash returns on recent investments and that is clearly showing up in the results and the performance of all of our sectors. We're proud of their performance on cash in Q4 and in the outlooks for 2024 and beyond. And the net effect of all of these factors is that unchanged free cash flow outlook for 2024 and 2025, along with a strong 2026. I'd highlight in terms of what drives that going forward? What's the underlying force as you point out? Certainly, the operations of the business growth in the top line is, first and foremost, with an opportunity for growth at the margin rate line as well that leads to really strong margin dollar volume, which will convert into cash through the strong working capital performance that we expect to continue which is essentially a stable assumption in our outlook. We're not looking for significant additional efficiencies given just how strong we were at the end of 2023. And then as we noted earlier, there are other structural factors that should help as well with CAS pension reimbursement growing slightly over the next few years and cash tax is projected to decline over that same period. So essentially, all of those factors will lead to strong -- strong free cash flow growth outlook for the next several years and beyond.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\nSeth Seifman: Thanks very much. And good morning. I guess a 2-part question about B-21. First was the $143 million EAC in the quarter, is that the extent of the entire anticipated loss on lot 1 and I guess, how do we think about the progression of losses on the various lots? And then second, the fact that this charge includes lots that will be in budgets in 2026 and 2027 and not come under contract for a while and not be worked on for a while. I guess how would you assess the opportunity to maybe ultimately do a little bit better than anticipated here.\nDavid Keffer: Sure. I can start on that, Seth. I think you've read properly into the $143 million EAC adjustment with Lot 1 having been awarded and the other is not yet awarded, that one does take the form of an EAC adjustment. So that $143 million is the lot 1 amount we are currently projecting. And the future progression while we can't get into much detail because that would involve a lot sizes and quantities and other classified details. Clearly, the implication is that there's modest growth from lot 1 to future lots on average. Over time, I think you're thinking of this the right way that our current projections would indicate an average of a couple of hundred million dollars a year of after-tax impact on our -- on the cash line from B-21, and that's, as I referred to a few minutes ago, the headwind we've been able to mitigate through strength in the rest of the business. In terms of your point about opportunity to outperform that over the long-term. Clearly, it is a core focus of our team to continue to drive efficiencies in the learning curves, successful outcomes of our negotiations with suppliers. We continue to engage and partner with our customer to understand macroeconomic impacts on the program and address opportunities for funding of relief, as Kathy mentioned earlier. And so we'll continue to address all of those opportunities. This is something we'll update you in the rest of the Street on over time.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with TD Cowen. You may proceed.\nCai Von Rumohr: Thanks so much. Kathy best wishes to feel better.\nKathy Warden: It sounds like you need those wishes as well.\nCai Von Rumohr: So anyway, so you had the loss on the B-21 kind of it didn't look like a loss couple of quarters ago. You've had your second loss on Halo. This is clearly proving to be an environment where on fixed price contract, there is more risk. Have you changed your strategy regarding how you bid and specifically with reference to Tranche 2 of the tracking satellites because you were on Tranche 1 and you were not on Tranche 2. So have you changed your strategy in terms of how you're bidding? And are there any contracts that you bid before changing your strategy that would still have risk that we're not aware of today?\nKathy Warden: Very insightful question as always, Cai. So when you look back to 2015, when we did B-21, we certainly have changed our view on bidding of contracts where did not have a mature design. It's a point of bid and yet we committed to fixed price options into the future. And we have, to my knowledge, not done that again. And we have passed on some high-profile programs as a result of the risk balance that the customer put forward in the RFP not meeting our standards. We have programs like Halo, which we have certainly learned some additional lessons and are applying those as we move forward. And you note on some very recent bids, we have taken a different approach in looking at firm fixed price, where we've either declined a bit if the customer chose to go fixed price or we've offered a price -- in the case of SDA Tranche 2 that we thought was fair and reasonable and the customer decided not to further negotiate with us. These are things that are going to happen and we're going to remain disciplined. We have plenty of opportunity in this company to grow. We have a strong pipeline of opportunities we're pursuing. And a strong pipeline of opportunities that we believe have the right risk/reward balance with industry.\nCai Von Rumohr: Thanks so much. Feel better.\nKathy Warden: Thank you too.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Gavin Parsons (NYSE:PSN) with UBS. You may proceed.\nGavin Parsons: Thanks, good morning.\nKathy Warden: Good morning.\nGavin Parsons: Maybe just following on Ron's question. Does the B-21 charge contemplate current conditions as they are? Does it have some consideration for future uncertainty in macro or supply chain?\nKathy Warden: With all of our EACs, B-21 included, we do our best based on what we know today to project conditions out into the future. Now with that said, that's difficult to do longer-term that period of performance is. So in this case, we're looking out over greater than 5 years. So as we get into those out years, that's a bit more speculative, but we do incorporate our expectations for changes in everything from material labor pricing to productivity and learning.\nGavin Parsons: Okay. Understood. And Dave, you mentioned the IRS appeal process. Any way to put a range around the possible cash impact on that?\nDavid Keffer: No, I'd refer you to our tax disclosures for more than enough detail on all of those fronts. It's tough to put a range around those things. We're looking forward to getting through processes, as you know, from those disclosures, we have a lot of open years that have yet to be resolved and looking forward to working with the IRS to come to reasonable resolutions there, and we'll update you on any book or tax differences from current reserves as we get there.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.\nScott Deuschle: Hey good morning.\nKathy Warden: Good morning.\nScott Deuschle: Dave, can you give us a sense for the proportion of supplier costs across the 5 LRIP lots that have now been fixed versus what's still open to negotiation?\nDavid Keffer: Sure. As we noted a few moments ago, we're now at a majority of the supplier costs that have been fully negotiated across the LRIP phase. And we're in various stages of negotiation with suppliers for the remainder. So that's one area where we have learn more and progressed in our process compared to where we were a year ago or even a quarter ago.\nScott Deuschle: Okay. Great. And then just as a follow-up, where does the commercial inventory come from in the space business? And is that EBIT headwind mostly gone now? Or is there any more of that left to come in 2024? Thank you.\nDavid Keffer: Sure. Thanks for the question. We had offsetting effects in 2024 and 2023, rather, including Q4 in the commercial elements of the space business. As you know, those are much smaller than and kind of tangential to the core national security space business that we have. In the case of those commercial inventory write-downs, those were related to newer investments in product lines to address burgeoning market opportunity in both the government and commercial elements of the space market. We did see some modest write-downs in various quarters in 2023 associated with those. Those are the types of things you occasionally go through as you make such new investments. So again, not core to the current or future growth story of the space business.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.\nKenneth Herbert: Yes, thank you good morning. Maybe, Kathy, at a high level, I wanted to follow up on your comments earlier regarding sort of the key margin drivers you outlined last year. Specifically more on the cost and productivity efforts and maybe on the mix side, are you seeing incrementally more opportunity now as we think about 2024? And how should we think about sort of the absolute opportunity on those now into this year versus perhaps how much more of a benefit we see in 2025 and beyond.\nKathy Warden: Thanks, Ken. We laid out 3 drivers, the first of which being stabilization in macroeconomics, and we are certainly seeing that in 2024, which is why we see our margin rates this year in line with last with some opportunity for improvement as we go throughout the year. We layer on top of that cost and productivity actions that we are taking in the company, and that will provide some tailwinds in 2024 growing tailwinds into 2025. And the mix shift really is a bit of a longer-term proposition for us. We've talked about that being a shift from cost type to fixed price, where we expect 2023 was really our high watermark for cost type, but a very gradual shift in that mix to fixed price with more of it coming in the latter half of this decade. And then international mix is the other where we don't expect significant international growth in 2024, but we do expect that to step up based on our pipeline and particularly the strong weapons demand outside the U.S. in 2025. That gives you a sense of what will be a tailwind to margin rate win.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.\nMyles Walton: Thanks, good morning. I was wondering, Dave, or Kathy, you previously talked about a $4 billion free cash flow target in 2028, effectively doubling what you've done in 2023. I just want to make sure that's still on the table, despite the charge absorption in that period of time? And then maybe, Kathy, on the margin expansion specific to Aerospace, is that still a 10% margin business? Or do we have to glide slope down a little bit further into 2025, 2026.\nDavid Keffer: Thanks for the question, Myles. Let me kick off with the 2023 free cash flow number. I appreciate the question on that because I think that too is core to the outlook going forward. Yes, we are reaffirming that $4 billion target for 2028. And essentially doubling the level that we were projecting at the midpoint of our 2023 guidance, which was $2 billion. Of course, we exceeded that by $100 million in our final result for 2023. The drivers of that growth are much of what we've talked about already. Certainly, growth in the top line. As Kathy just noted, some of the drivers of margin rate expansion opportunity which leads to margin dollars having an opportunity to exceed the growth rate of our top line through 2028. And importantly, CapEx will moderate during that same period. So we've noted that 2023 and 2024 of these peak years of capital intensity that continues to be our outlook with declines in 2025 and beyond. And then pension and tax will serve as tailwinds during that same period. So that leads you to the $4 billion number. And I think if you look at the 2024 and 2025 numbers we've reiterated for our free cash outlook today and add in that 2026 range, you'll get to that same glide slope that would push you upward toward the $4 billion number by 2028. So those are the building blocks and the way we plan to get there.\nKathy Warden: And Myles, on AS margins, what we're seeing, as Dave noted earlier is that with the B-21 growth being a bit stronger than we had anticipated, AS is stepping up on top line. It is putting some pressure on margin rate, but margin dollars are exactly where we had anticipated they would be coming into 2024, and our guide therefore, remained consistent for AS on a dollar basis, even though we now are looking at more of a mid-9s rate projection. As you go out over time, it's less dependent on what happens with absorbing that lower rate on B-21 and more what happens in terms of other new programs coming into the AS portfolio and the rate at which we will book those programs. So we'll provide you more insight into that over the coming year as we look towards 2025 and beyond.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. You may proceed.\nRobert Spingarn: Hey good morning. Kathy, a few minutes ago, you alluded to international and I wanted to bring up IBCS because it's had some strong demand signals from international customers and thought maybe you could dig into that program a little bit, give us a sense of how large it is in revenue or how -- in 2023 or 2024? And how big it might be, let's say, 5 years from now?\nKathy Warden: It certainly is an area of strength in our portfolio. We've seen strong performance by the team on the U.S. Army program and also as we are deploying in Poland, and we see follow-on opportunities in Poland as a result. We've also, as I\u2019ve spoken about throughout the course of 2023, added a number of additional countries who have expressed interest in the program to the pipeline, and that's what would drive the growth that we anticipate in the 2025 time frame. As you noted, I mentioned international demand. Part of that is weapons part of that is the IBCS portfolio. And then, of course, we have some aircraft and mission system strength in the pipeline for international in 2025 as well. The program itself is growing at a fairly rapid rate, but off of a relatively small it's about $400 million of annual sales. And we expect that to grow, of course, but not a major contributor is the enterprise line for growth.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. You may proceed.\nGeorge Shapiro: Good morning. Kathy, I wanted to ask on the charge for the B-21, what caused it to be bigger than the 0 to $1.2 billion range that you've kind of been reiterating since last year? And then just specifically, maybe the margin that you had said would be around 10% is now maybe 9.5%. I know you alluded to a few minutes ago, the B-21 was growing faster. But it\u2019s got to grow a lot faster to drop the margin by 50 basis points. So I was just wondering if you could explore that a little bit more. Thanks very much.\nKathy Warden: Let me start with the first part of your question and Dave will cover the second. As we noted, we identified this risk last year, and we, throughout the year, revisited it on a quarterly basis. There were 2 primary changes in the fourth quarter that both led us to deem it probable loss as well as impacted the value of that loss. First, we significantly reduced our projections for funding related to macroeconomic impacts, as we've talked about a couple of times already. Although we continue to partner with the government to address these impacts. We believe it's prudent in light of the current budget status to reduce those assumptions. And so we did that. The second is we've experienced growth in our cost projection, both in the internal production costs as we've continued to build aircraft as Dave talked about through our negotiations with suppliers. We have learned and built that learning into the forward-looking estimates that we now have in the EAC, so those were the factors. As we've talked about, we did a very detailed look at this EAC in the fourth quarter and had matured and had actual data to reflect on that we did not have at an earlier point.\nDavid Keffer: Let me follow up on the second part of your question because I do think it's an important nuance. The AS business was operating in the mid-10 billions in scale over the past year, it exceeded our original expectations in sales in 2023 and now is projected to exceed them even more significantly compared to where they were a year ago in 2024. We were talking about a flat 2023 and very modest growth in 2024 based off of that mid-tens level. And now we're all the way up into the low 11s. And so that low 11s at a mid-9% margin rate is the same as the mid-to-high 10s at a slightly higher margin rate. We're really focused on driving the dollar volume of operating margin in our Aeronautics business and across our business, it's that return on invested capital, the growth in margin dollars and in free cash flow that results from it, that is really our core focus.\nTodd Ernst: Josh, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our final question. Our final question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi. You may proceed.\nJason Gursky: Hey good morning everybody. Dave, just a clarification question for you to start. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that there were some shifting priorities from the government and the space business that was leading to a deceleration in growth. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on what those shifting priorities might be? And then Kathy, I just wanted to provide you maybe a bit of an open-ended question to kind of wrap all this together here. Just broadly talk about all the risks and opportunities that you see in front of you on the execution side of things. You've obviously got record backlog here and we know about the B-21 risk. But I'm wondering if you could just maybe highlight and wrap this all together, do we have a balanced risk and opportunities portfolio here, we a little bit more overweight risk than we are opportunity? And maybe just kind of dive into a little bit of the details of what you're seeing and maybe what you're all doing to address those issues. Thanks.\nDavid Keffer: Sure. Great questions, Jason. Let me go ahead and start with your original question on the national security space portfolio. As we mentioned, our guidance captures growth and declines in various programs across all of our portfolios, very much including space. In the case of space, as we've noted, there are some shifts in budget priorities. A lot of our customers are having to address budget prioritization, particularly as it relates to 2025 and beyond. With that said, in this particular case, given that it's in the restricted domain, there's not much more we can say about the mission or the program or anything like that. What's important there is that our space sector, and therefore, company guidance accounts for our latest understanding of all the programs in that portfolio and the likely path forward for them. And I think when you look at the space guidance, you see a lot of value creation as they continue to grow the top line. And in this case, now grow margin rates alongside that with lower capital intensity starting in 2025, in particular, you see a lot of improvement in returns on invested capital in the space business, given how much growth they've built in their foundation over the last few years.\nJason Gursky: Kathy?\nKathy Warden: And Jason, I really appreciate the question. I wish I had another hour to discuss it with you, but being respectful of everybody's time, let me just simply say that I see our portfolio and the set of opportunities and risks we have as balanced and consistent with what I have seen in recent years since I stepped into this role. We have a team who has stepped up and provided top line growth, which I believe is industry leading at about 5% on a compound annual basis each of the last four years. We're projecting that again this year. We see the opportunity space is rich, both domestically and internationally. And to the risks that we have in executing this portfolio, while the pandemic certainly made that more challenging for the last couple of years. We're turning the corner. Our overall program performance has not been stronger since I've been at the company, and that's 15 years and going. So I really feel good about how this team is positioned. We now have fully disclosed and taken into the P&L the B-21 risk, which we've been talking about and feel confident that we can now go execute this program. And I am proud of what the team collectively has accomplished across 2023 and look forward to the outlook we have in place for 2024. So with that, I just want to again thank my colleagues at Northrop Grumman for their dedication, both to our country and our company. I also want to thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in April. So Josh, that concludes the call. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

And welcome to the Murphy Oil Corporation Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Kelly Whitley, Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications. Please go ahead.\nKelly Whitley: Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter earnings call today. Joining me is Roger Jenkins, President and Chief Executive Officer along with Tom Mireles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Eric Hambly, Executive Vice President, Operations. Please refer to the informational slides we have placed on the Investor Relations section of our website as you follow along with our webcast today.

For further discussion of risk factors, see Murphy's 2022 Annual Report on 10-K on file with SEC. Murphy takes no duty to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. I will now turn the call over to Roger Jenkins.\nRoger Jenkins: Thank you, Kelly. Good morning everyone and thanks for listening to our call today. As we turn to slide two, I'd like to highlight Murphy's ongoing focus on our priorities to Delever, Execute, Explore and Return throughout 2023, with another strong year of production and excellent execution, we achieved our $500 million debt reduction goal for the year and have reduced debt by $1.7 billion since the end of 2020. We produced 186,000 barrels equivalent per day for the year with 52% oil volumes. During the fourth quarter, we began procuring equipment for the Lac Da Vang field development in Vietnam and production resumed at the non-operated Terra Nova field offshore Canada with wells scheduled to ramp up production through the first quarter of this year. In the Gulf of Mexico, we acquired an 8% working interest in the Zephyrus discovery for $13 million in the fourth quarter. For the year, we achieved 139% reserve replacement with preliminary total reserves of 724 million barrels equivalent and approximately an 11-year reserve life. In exploration, we were named a paired hybrid and 8 exploration blocks in the Gulf of Mexico federal lease sale 261 held last fall. We also continue preparing for our 2024 planned exploration wells in the Gulf and Vietnam and advancing seismic reprocessing projects in the Gulf of Mexico and Cote d'Ivoire. Due to significantly reducing debt prior to 2023, we're able to reach Murphy 2.0 of our capital allocation framework last year, representing a debt level between $1 billion and $1.8 billion. I'm pleased to say that we executed additional share repurchases totaling $75 million or 1.7 million shares at an average price of $43.42 per share in the fourth quarter. For full year 2023, we repurchased 3.4 million shares for $150 million at an average price of $43.96 per share. As a result, we have $450 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization at year-end. I'm pleased to return to the share buyback mode, where we have purchased $1.8 billion of stock in the last 10 years. We announced earlier today a 9% quarterly dividend increase to $1.20 per share annualized back to our level of 2016 and look forward to targeting Murphy 3.0 as we're continuing delivering shareholder returns and reducing debt levels. On Slide three, Murphy's production averaged 185,000 equivalents per day in the fourth quarter, 94,000 barrels of oil per day. For the year, production of 186,000 equivalents with 98,000 oil per day. For the quarter, we realized over $79 a barrel of oil, reversing a slight premium to WTI. This is on a netback basis. As well as nearly $21 per barrel for NGLs and $2.12 per 1,000 cubic feet for nat gas. This led Murphy generating $788 million of total revenue in the quarter. And for the full year, we realized over $77 per barrel for oil and generated $3.2 billion in revenue, excluding NCI. On Slide four, great year reserves. Our preliminary proved reserves totaled 724 million barrels equivalent, representing a 139% reserve replacement ratio from year-end 2022. This increase is due in part to additional 13 million barrels equivalent of proved reserves for the Lac Da Vang field in Vietnam as well as AECO natural gas price changes. Total proved reserves in 2023 were 57% proven and 41% liquids weighted, and we have a proved reserve life of 11 years. Overall, I am pleased to say we've maintained our proved reserves since 2020 with an average annual CapEx of approximately $1 billion, excluding non-controlling interest and including acquisitions, must also consider that our strong reserve outcome is based on oil price that was $15 per barrel lower than 2022. Further, our reserves, excluding Syncrude are 27% higher than a decade ago when we became an independent E&P company. I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Tom Mireles, to update us on our financial results. Tom?\nThomas Mireles: Thanks, Roger, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide five. In the fourth quarter, Murphy reported $116 million of net income or $0.75 per diluted share, $140 million of adjusted net income or $0.90 per diluted share. Due to another strong operational quarter, we achieved $414 million of adjusted EBITDA with $219 million of accrued CapEx, excluding non-controlling interest and acquisition-related CapEx. Murphy continued to return cash to shareholders in the fourth quarter by repurchasing $75 million of common stock at an average price of $43.42 per share. For the year, we achieved $709 million of adjusted net income and $2.1 billion of adjusted EBITDAX. Accrued CapEx totaled $1 billion, excluding non-controlling interest and acquisition-related CapEx. Further, our 2023 G&A expense was the lowest in more than 20 years. On Slide six, as we discussed as of December 31, 2023, we had $1.3 billion of senior notes outstanding and $1.1 billion of liquidity and our next senior note maturity isn't until December 2027. Since year-end 2020 and including our $300 million debt reduction goal for 2024, we will have reduced our total debt by 66% by year-end 2024. From 2020 through 2023, this resulted in about an $84 million reduction in annual interest expense on long-term debt. I'm pleased to say that during this time and more recently in alignment with our capital allocation framework, we have been able to increase our quarterly dividend and return to our 2016 level of $1.20 per share annualized. And since year-end 2014, Murphy has repurchased 24.8 million shares or 14% of the shares outstanding at that time. While we are pleased to be back to our 2016 level on the dividend, investors are also advantaged by our balance sheet. Our net debt has improved 50% since 2016, and it's the lowest since before 2012. Slide seven. As we first introduced a little over a year ago, our capital allocation framework defines three debt thresholds and corresponding shareholder return allocations. We're currently in Murphy 2.0 with $1.3 billion of total debt and are targeting $300 million of debt reduction this year to reach Murphy 3.0. At that time, shareholder returns will increase to a minimum of 50% of adjusted free cash flow. Slide eight. At Murphy, we remain mindful of taking actions that benefit all stakeholders, and we are proud of our ongoing environmental and community stewardship achievements. This is a focus at all levels of the organization and metrics such as greenhouse gas emissions intensity, safety and spill performance are all included in our annual goals. I'm proud of what we continue to accomplish at Murphy and highlight that these efforts are recognized repeatedly with top quartile rankings by third parties. All of our improvements can be found in our sustainability report, which is available on our website. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Roger.\nRoger Jenkins: Thank you, Tom. Let's look now to the quarter results and our onshore assets we produced and combined 100,000 barrels equivalent today with 30% liquids weighting in quarter 4 and Eagle Ford Shale we produced 31,000 equivalents per day with 86% liquids. We brought on 3 non-operated wells in Tilden as all we had for the quarter. No wells were brought online in our onshore assets as well. In Tupper Montney, we produced 386 million cubic feet per day in the fourth quarter and initiated drilling a 10-well pad with 2 rigs. In Kaybob Duvernay, we produced 4,000 equivalents per day for the quarter, including 69% liquids. Turning to offshore in the quarter, Murphy produced approximately 84,000 equivalents per day in our offshore business at 82% oil. The Gulf of Mexico production totaled 81,000 equivalents per day. We brought online operated Dalmatian number 1 well in the quarter as well as drilled, completed and recently brought online the Marmalard 3 well. Also during the quarter, we acquired an 8% working interest in the non-operated Zephyrus discovery for approximately $13 million after closing adjustments. And offshore Canada, we produced 4,000 equivalents per day. The non-operated Terra Nova FPSO resumed operations during the quarter and production is expected to ramp up this quarter in 2024. Looking at exploration as previously announced, we expanded our exploration portfolio in 2023 with the addition of 5 key blocks in Cote d'Ivoire, and we gain seismic reprocessing and the side for the opportunities in these blocks including advancing the field development plans for the undeveloped Paon discovery. In Vietnam, the Murphy Board sanctioned the Lac Da Vang field development project in the fourth quarter. Our two exploration wells planned in 2024 provide upside to this development, particularly as one well is very near the platform facility. Lastly, in the Gulf of Mexico, we were named a parent bidder on 8 blocks in the latest federal lease sale. These locations will provide near-field exploration opportunities close to existing assets. Now we'll dig into our capital and production plans for the year. On Slide 13, on the capital side, our plan is structured so that we can continue generating sufficient free cash flow to advance our capital allocation framework. We forecast a CapEx range of $920 million to $1.02 billion with nearly 60% of the spending in the first six months of the year. Overall, 85% of our capital plan is designated for development work with 80% of this supporting operated activity. As we target Murphy 3.0 with our $300 million debt reduction goal in 2024, I'm pleased we were able to announce this morning a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend to $1.20 per share annualized. We're also targeting share repurchase equal to 25% of our adjusted cash flow for the year, and we believe these goals can be accomplished at a minimum oil price of $70 a barrel. On the production side for 2024, our forecast for the first quarter production range is 163,000 to 171,000 barrels a day, including 53% oil. This range is impacted by 13,000 barrels equivalent per day of total Gulf of Mexico downtime as well as 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of onshore downtime, including the Gulf downtime of 6000 per day associated with the wells currently off-line that are scheduled for work overs and will return to production in the first half of the year. Also includes 5,000 barrels per day for planned facility and downstream maintenance as well as 2,000 barrels equivalent per day of downtime to repair a damaged subsea equipment in the Mormont field in the Gulf of Mexico. For the full year 2024, we forecast production range of 180,000 to 188,000 per day, including 52% oil volumes. This forecast includes approximately 2,000 barrels equivalent per day of assumed annualized Gulf of Mexico storm downtime and accounts for 2023 divestiture of some 1,500 barrels equivalent per day in non-core Canadian asset sales. Consistent with several years, our annual plan focuses on maximizing free cash flow, which has led to a first type weighted capital program. As a result, we have seen material production growth from the first quarter to the fourth quarter each year in 2024 is forecast to have a similar trajectory with production rising to nearly 200,000 equivalents per day in the fourth quarter, which will be our fourth year in a row of higher fourth quarter production. Now for more details on the individual assets, I'll turn it over to Eric, our EVP of Operations. Eric?\nEric Hambly: Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. Slide 15. Our 2024 capital budget of $320 million for the Eagle Ford Shale supports a program of bringing online 19 operated wells, primarily in Catarina, as well as 18 gross non-operated Tilden wells. Additionally, we plan to drill 11 operated Karnes wells, which are scheduled for completion in early 2025. With ongoing utilization of our optimized completion design, we forecast 2024 production of 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day with 71% oil volumes. We recently contracted a new high-spec drilling rig from Patterson-UTI (NASDAQ:PTEN) Drilling Company, LLC. While only one well has been drilled so far, we are extremely pleased with the results and hope to see advanced drilling efficiencies throughout the year. Slide 16. Turning to Tupper Montney. Our 2024 capital plan of $90 million includes bringing online 13 operated wells, all scheduled for the second quarter. We are drilling in this area today and are 85% complete on our first 10-well pad. We forecast for average production of 370 million cubic feet per day in 2024 with this plan and look forward to continuing our real-time frac optimization, which has helped us achieve some of our highest IP30 rates in company history in recent years. Slide 17. In Kaybob Duvernay, we have a $40 million capital plan for 2024 to support bringing online 3 operated wells in the second quarter as well as initiating drilling a 4-well pad late in the year. Overall, we forecast average production of 4,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with 67% liquids volumes in 2024. Slide 18. Our total 2024 offshore capital plan of $370 million supports bringing online operated and non-operated tieback wells in the Gulf of Mexico as well as the progressing of the non-operated St. Malo waterflood project, the Lac Da Vang field development project in Vietnam and the Paon field development plan in Cote d'Ivoire. Through 2024, we will bring 4 operated subsea tieback wells online with the first being Marmalard 3, which came online earlier this month. Additionally, 7 non-operated wells are forecast to begin production this year. Combined, we forecast average production of 88,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for 2024. Slide 19. As disclosed in our last quarter call, we experienced mechanical issues at 2 operated Gulf of Mexico fields in 2023. We have a rig currently on location at Neidermeyer, and the workover is expected to be complete in the second quarter of 2024. For the Dalmatian subsea safety valve repair, we anticipate completing this repair in the middle of 2024. We also have zone changes planned at 2 operated Marmalard wells in the first quarter of 2024. Additionally, earlier this year, we experienced an issue with subsea equipment in our Mormont field, and we'll be making that repair in the first quarter of 2024. The non-operated Lucius #9 well workover has been completed and the well is forecast to return to production shortly. Additionally, the previously disclosed non-operated Kodiak 3 well stimulation and zone addition is scheduled for mid-2024. Slide 20. As announced last quarter, our Board sanctioned the Lac Da Vang field development project in BLOCK 15-01/05 in Vietnam. We have allocated approximately $40 million of CapEx to the project in 2024 to support facilities construction. To ensure capital efficiency, the field will be developed in phases through 2029, reaching first oil in 2026. Overall, Murphy is targeting 100 million barrels of oil equivalent estimated gross recoverable resources, and we booked preliminary net proved reserves of 13 million barrels of oil equivalent at year-end 2023. We forecast a field will achieve gross production of 30,000 to 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or 10,000 to 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net to Murphy. The field is 96% oil and we will receive a premium to Brent oil pricing. And with that, I will turn it back to Roger.\nRoger Jenkins: Thank you, Eric. As to exploration, our total 24 exploration plan of $120 million support the drilling of 2 Gulf of Mexico and 2 Vietnam exploration wells, which combined target approximately 120 million barrels equivalent on a net mean unrisked resource basis. Additionally, this plan funds related exploration costs and ongoing geological and geophysical work. In the Gulf of Mexico, participating in 2 Oxy operated wells, which are forecast to spud in the second quarter of 2024, both of these opportunities are located near infrastructure. In Vietnam, in addition to the Lac Da Vang field development, which is ongoing, we're planning to drill 2 exploration wells in 2024, and I look forward to the upside possibilities that these material near-field exploration prospects provide. The rig has now been secured to drill both wells beginning with the HSV exploration well in Block 15-2, which will spud in the third quarter of 2024 and target a mean upward gross resource potential of 170 million to 430 million barrels equivalent. We anticipate the [indiscernible] exploration well in Block 15-1 was flood in the fourth quarter of 2024. This well is just to the southwest of our Lac Da Vang field development and will target a main upward gross resource potential of $65 million to $135 million equivalent. Overall, these two exciting prospects gained further advantage by infrastructure provided by our nearby Lac Da Vang field. On Slide 23, in Cote d'Ivoire, we're excited about the initial work completed on our newest country entry, including initiating size and reprocessing and looking forward to advancing the opportunities across our five significant blocks. As well in 2024, we continue reviewing commerciality and field development concepts for the Paon discovery in Block CI-103, which is appraised with multiple wells by a previous operator. As part of the agreement on the block, we are committed to submitting to the government a viable field development plan by the end of 2025. Clearly demonstrated in 2021, 2022 and 2023, Murphy has done a tremendous job in reducing debt. We have built a strong, safe balance sheet for the company and resulted in a 0.7x debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA based on third quarter results. We've been able to accomplish this delevering of our assets and generate significant free cash flow, as highlighted by our peer-leading 13% cash flow yield and $23 per barrel of oil equivalent metric. I'm proud that Murphy is a leader in these attributes and with reaching our $1 billion debt target later this year, which ties to one times EBITDA at a mid-40s pricing, we will be able to continue our effort to return cash to our shareholders with a much safer balance sheet and safer than our peers with no bonds to be refinanced in our business until late 2027. As we look to Slide 26, we maintaining a very similar long-term plan to what was disclosed a year ago as we now incorporate the LDV field development as well as higher exploration spending, all of which supports long-term oil production growth. Overall, we forecast to achieve our $1 billion debt target in 2024 with no additional debt maturities until 2027 and we accomplished this in part by reinvesting approximately 50% of our operating cash flow in our business. Our average annual capital spend of $1.1 billion will support a 5% CAGR through 2026, increasing production up to an average of 195,000 equivalents per day to approximately 95,000 of oil equivalents per day produced in our offshore business. Through 2026, we remain focused on achieving first oil in Vietnam with key exploration wells planned in the Gulf, Vietnam and Cote d'Ivoire and conducting additional geophysical studies. Overall, our payout to shareholders will increase during this time as we reached 3.0 of our capital allocation framework. Longer-term, we plan to reinvest approximately 45% of our cash flows, achieving an average production level of 210,000 to 220,000 equivalents per day with more than a 50% oil weighting. We're forecasting generating ample free cash flow to allocate towards additional debt reductions, further shareholder returns and accretive investments as well as supporting any exploration success. Additionally, as part of this plan, we remain committed to achieving metrics that are consistent with an investment-grade company. This year's plan has higher production levels in 2027 and beyond with significantly higher offshore production in those years compared to last. And further, we did lower our gas price in this plan, which you can be seen in the footnote of the slide. As we wrap things up here on Slide 27, as we look back, we had a great year on safety and protecting our people, we continue achieving new company lows every year on emissions intensity. We made strides in executing our capital allocation framework and achieved our decade low debt level on a net basis. We continue to reap the benefits of an oil-weighted high-margin asset base, and we grew our proved reserves. This team is excited to advance our field development project in Vietnam and began the procurement process last year. We look forward to a potential upside in the area with our upcoming exploration wells. And also expanded -- we've also expanded our exploration portfolio with additional blocks in Cote d'Ivoire. We have a solid foundation to move forward. We'll continue building on our strong safety culture and target additional emissions intensity improvements. Shareholder returns remain at the forefront, and our debt reduction has only strengthened our balance sheet, and it made us more resistant cyclical commodity prices. Our business, a large multi-basin portfolio generates peer-leading cash flow metrics, but further support our shareholder returns while providing future optionality from our operations. Lastly, we look forward to maintaining our exploration capabilities to augment our portfolio in a measured approach. In closing, as always, I thank our incredible employees for their continued dedication and hard work supporting our company. That's the end of our prepared remarks today, we stand by for our calls, and we have a long list of calls here today. So here we go.\nOperator: Thank you.[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan. Please ask your question.\nArun Jayaram: Yes, good morning Roger and team.\nRoger Jenkins: Good morning, Arun.\nArun Jayaram: Roger, I was wondering if you could shed some more light on your 2025 and 2026 kind of outlook. You've outlined a $1.1 billion average CapEx program from 2024 to 2026. And help us understand what type of spending projects you see in 2025 and 2026, which will impact the CapEx trajectory as well as how do you see spending trending in the LDV development, it looks like about $40 million this year, but obviously probably going to rise as you get closer to first oil?\nRoger Jenkins: First on the question, thanks for that. We do have a plan this year. We consider to be fairly consistent with latest prices and plans. We're going to be like $1 billion CapEx Company in those years. And if you look at our CapEx from 2023, 2024, it's very similar, and I suspect it remains so. We have an ample list of Gulf of Mexico, 2P projects we call them the last -- we have over 2 or 3 years of rig work there if we want it. We'll be keeping our Eagle Ford Shale in that same level and reaching up to the field our plant in the Montney. The LDV project is not super expensive for Murphy, probably around $300 million total and it will be spread over 3 or 4 years very nicely. There will be no big slugs of CapEx there. And I would consider the CapEx in Vietnam to go up in 2025 and 2026, almost doubling or slightly more and pull back in some of our non-op projects at St. Malo gets going. Terra Nova finally finishes their work. And that we get higher production in Montney to go forward. This plan is a very robust plan and what's more robust about it in the past as we have found more offshore projects to do with Vietnam. We have a much more -- much bigger offshore business. If you compare plan to plan, our offshore production is some 10,000 barrels a day higher than 2027. Our total production in 2028 is much higher than it was in the final plan and our oil production is 5,000 or 6,000 barrels a day in 2028 compared to last year's plan. So this is a really good plan. We're going to accumulate between $5 billion and $6 billion of free cash flow from 2024 to 2028 million with the assets we own today, and we'll be able to return massive amounts to our shareholders through buybacks and have very large dividend levels because it will be purchasing so much stock. And we're extremely well positioned with this plan. It's very much a consistent plan with inflation and things happening and resurging a plan like you do every year. And it's in a really good shape, Arun.\nArun Jayaram: Great, thanks Roger. And I just had a follow-up. I was wondering if you could give us an update on the life extension plan, how that went to Terra Nova, and just kind of the ramp that you expect maybe some details on how you expect that ramp to play out kind of net to you -- net barrels?\nRoger Jenkins: I'm so super pleased with that execution. I'm going to let Eric cover it for you.\nEric Hambly: Thanks, Roger. That's a great question. On Terra Nova, as we highlighted before, the life extension project was completed at the end of -- created completed, sorry, in the middle of last quarter, fourth quarter of 2023. And we produced about 1,000 MBOE [ph] average in the quarter. We expect that the production will ramp up here pretty soon after they complete sort of the final stages of additional compressor commissioning. And in the first quarter, we expected to come up to around 4,000 barrels a day. And then on an average basis because it's ramping through the quarter. And then for the last three quarters of the year, we expect production to be in the range or be around 5.5000 BOE per day net to Murphy.\nArun Jayaram: Great. Thanks a lot gentlemen.\nRoger Jenkins: Thank you Arun. Appreciate your call.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Neal Dingmann from Truist Securities. Please ask your question.\nNeal Dingmann: Hi morning. Thanks for the time. Roger, for you or Eric. Could you just talk a little more on color on Slide 18. I really think the upside from your Gulf obviously the Gulf offshore development seem to be quite material. And I'm just wondering, is the 300 kind of change that you talked about recently, I guess, to be exact, is that for just the first 3 projects Marmalad, Khaleesi and Mormont maybe just talk about the timing behind. I know you have a time line in here, but just maybe give a little more color on this, if you could because it looks so sizable.\nRoger Jenkins: Thanks, Neal. They're spending across all of it, and I'll let Eric give you more detail.\nEric Hambly: Yes, sure. So 1 of the things we're trying to highlight here is where we're spending money this year. Obviously, if you look at the slide, you see production coming online from new wells across the year in the Marmalad, Khaleesi Mormont fields. We are also highlighting that we're spending money in other fields, and it's basically long lead equipment that we're spending on in 2024 that will contribute to new volumes and new wells coming online, 2025, 2026, etcetera. And if we wanted to, we could make a table like this that would go on out to 2028, but we didn't do that. So as Roger highlighted a few minutes ago, we expect relatively stable spending in our overall offshore business with all of these really awesome investment opportunities we have to continue to bring in more wells and do workovers, etcetera, in our offshore business and maintain those offshore volumes flat for the next several years with just the known stuff we have without an exploration success anywhere.\nRoger Jenkins: Yes. Further on that, Neal, we have our Board meeting and we project our projects these are well in excess of 100% rate of return. And later on in the slide deck, we talk about workovers, which are unfortunate some of these wells had some mechanical problems after fix, the payout on these wells are 3, 4 months. So everything we do offshore 150%, 170%, 200% rate of return. So near infrastructure and unlike onshore, they're spending on things without necessarily drilling. We have to buy long-lead equipment items, production equipment, drilling equipment casing. They're spending on things associated with all these developments. This is some of the best investment you can ever make in the oilfield today.\nEric Hambly: Neal, one thing you may want to have a look at Slide 39 in our presentation, where we try to highlight the depth of our offshore inventory. We don't disclose every single well by itself, but we do attempt to show you how strong and resilient they are. So the majority of our offshore identified projects breakeven below $35 a barrel. So super robust, super strong, high return. They're well identified. These are known things in our portfolio that we're planning to bring forward over the next several years.\nNeal Dingmann: No, I'm glad you've got you all, [indiscernible], but made return. It's certainly notable. And then just a quick follow-up on your onshore. It seems like, I think in the press release, you suggested about 1/4 of the Eagle Ford would be on field development. Is that normal? And can you just talk about what that will be directed for?\nEric Hambly: Yes. We use that term field development Neal to count things that are mostly associated with just bringing on new wells, but they're not specifically the drilling and completion cost. So if we have to build a pipeline to connect a new pad to an existing facility or if an existing facility requires some kind of upgrade to handle the new volume. So generally, it's just surface equipment that we're upgrading. It's also we continue to make improvements in our greenhouse gas and methane emissions, and we're spending a little bit of money there to drive those improvements in our Eagle Ford business. So it's mostly just bringing on new wells, the surface equipment related to it, but a few other enhancements that improve our operations and lower our downtime and help us with our free cash flows.\nNeal Dingmann: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Leo Mariani from Roth MKM. Please ask your question.\nRoger Jenkins: Good morning, Leo.\nLeo Mariani: Hey good morning. I want to kind of quickly follow up on the Gulf of Mexico. You kind of briefly mentioned this, Roger, but I don't know if I'm looking at this right, but it seems like maybe there's been kind of a -- I don't know, an unusually kind of high number of sort of well failures that have required workover of late -- just wanted to get a sense if you guys are attributing that to anything in particular out there, maybe this is just kind of a recent bad streak of luck and just in the Gulf, I was hoping you could also maybe talk about M&A as I guess we've seen an asset trade lately and perhaps there'll be others coming out of the Gulf?\nRoger Jenkins: Thanks, Leo. That's you said it right. It's bad luck. It's nothing to do with anything. These are not related. There's a safety valve instrument in Dalmatian. This has been an occurrence that happened in the Gulf to various operators through the years. You test the safety valve from a regulatory basis and the valve won't open back up for different kinds of reasons. Then we had to go do some studies about the metallurgy of the type of equipment we need, there's very little equipment on the ground by these large service equipment companies today. You have to procure things, procure rig. You can get rigs in the Gulf to do work. We've been able to do it. It's not that tight. We're able to do it. And then the well in Neidermeyer is a complex deep pressured well that had a communication. It looks like between the tubing to the casing. We bought this well. We didn't complete this well. It wouldn't have been the way we would have designed the well, we can say that. And we need to go fix the well, and we have a rig there today to fix it. These things are unrelated. And what's really happening to us here in this first quarter is some work that needs to be done that we had to procure and get the equipment to do with large downtime, for example, they're lifting up the famous subsea water injection equipment at St. Malo, which is a big deal for one of the greatest fields in the Gulf on the highest margin. Fields in the Gulf that has to be shut in and picked up. Delta House has some equipment that's being installed by another operator. So we have a lot of planned downtime that came in on top of some one-off workover leading to a low first quarter and we haven't put a well online in onshore in quite a while. That's the way we run our business to have this incredible low, free cash flow yield, incredible leading net debt to EBITDA, no bonds to be refinanced until 2027, the only energy company in that situation. So all that's set up to provide all that safety for our shareholders, and we're returning money to shareholders. So to wrap all this up, some poor luck, things happened with some downtime. As to M&A, thanks for asking that question. We are a company that prides ourselves in very successful M&A, over $8 billion of M&A in the decade here. We have an incredible team, a senior team, and we have a proprietary process to look at things on a certain basis. The recent large deal is something that didn't fit the criteria of us. We've known about the deal for a long time. And I think if you back up to 30,000 feet, what's the difference is the debt-to-EBITDA level of the outcome of that deal versus us striving to be one times debt-to-EBITDA at $45 oil, not 1.6 net EBITDA at $75 oil. So we're in a different total world. We have all the assets we need and we're striving to protect our shareholders through large returns and cycle pricing and with this incredible balance sheet. So that's kind of how we think it. So for us to do M&A, it's a certain criteria of the age of the assets and the returns that we like that fit in with our framework, and we have -- that's how we judge that. And that's the answer on that. There are plenty of opportunities. We look at them all the time, and we're very proud of our screening and our process that we have that's led to a great success on M&A front here. One of our best things that we do actually. So thank you, Leo, for supporting us and calling in today.\nLeo Mariani: Yes. I appreciate that, Roger here. Maybe just a quick follow-up on the Eagle Ford here. So it seems like you guys are somewhat electing to turn in line quite a bit fewer operated wells in 2024 versus what you did in 2023. And it seems like that's really kind of leading to production ticking lower. Can you maybe just kind of talk through that a little bit? I know you're bringing on a slug of wells kind of early in 2025, but just a little surprised to kind of maybe see some of the timing with a lot of fewer turning lines this year?\nEric Hambly: Yes. Thanks, Leo. This is Eric. I'll just give you a little bit of my thoughts on that. In the Eagle Ford, we are expecting 30,000 barrels a day in 2024, down about 3,000 barrels a day from 2023. And we're pulling back our capital program there just a little bit. Some of that's driven by just the timing around when we're bringing on the wells. We're bringing on the average new well a little bit later this year than before. Capital decisions we made in 2023 had us entering the year without any wells to complete early. So we're drilling wells in the Eagle Ford before we can complete them. And then we're happy that we're able to, within our overall framework, direct some capital investment to Vietnam for future long-term overly growth there with not changing our total capital level, but displace a little bit of Eagle Ford spending for Vietnam spending and set us up for a nice long plateau out there in Vietnam. And I expect in 2025, you probably see a little bit higher level. Our exit rate in Eagle Ford at the end of 2024, ought to be quite a bit higher than we saw in 2023 due to the timing of the new well delivery. And you ought to see us, as we've said for several years now, managed Eagle Ford in a 30,000 to 35,000 barrel a day range with pretty consistent CapEx. We are really excited about this new rig we picked up. It's just flying through the first lateral and happy to see that. And hopefully, we can see additional operational improvements and capital efficiencies there as we progress through the year.\nLeo Mariani: Thank you. That\u2019s very clear. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Paul Cheng from Scotia Bank. Please ask your question.\nPaul Cheng: Hey good morning guys. Two quick ones. Maybe the first one is for Tom, just to maybe remind us. On the cash payout, when you calculate it, is it your estimate for the full year and then you provided or that you just do it quarter-by-quarter. The second question, I was looking at your last quarter presentation. You are looking for 2023 to 2025 at about $900 million now that you say in 2024 to 2026 is $1.1 million. Now obviously, that's a 1-year change, but I don't think that really make the difference. Your production outlook is largely about the same. So -- and you just mentioned that Vietnam is really [indiscernible] to you, only about 300. So is there any other areas that we should be aware why that the increase in budget?\nThomas Mireles: Okay. Thanks, Paul. I'll talk about the first one on how we're executing our framework, which we're really pretty excited about how we've moved into 2.0, and we're more than halfway through it. We do think about this in terms of hitting our annual targets here for our debt target. So quarter-by-quarter, as we've disclosed, our CapEx is front loaded. So we're not going to -- we'll see more of our adjusted free cash flow towards the back end of the year. But we do monitor it quarter-by-quarter to see if there's an opportunity to do something to execute part of our framework. But really, it is something that we're looking at on an annual basis to make sure we try to stay in line with our commitment to returns to shareholders.\nPaul Cheng: So Tom, if I get it correctly, it means that in any particular quarter, you may buy back more or less than the 25% that the current indicator would suggest, right?\nThomas Mireles: That's right. Yes. You'll see some -- you may see some fluctuations there and try to hit that annual number for us.\nRoger Jenkins: We're not afraid, Paul, to buy stock on our revolver if we get separated from the group or the pack here because our company is a very solid company with incredible cash returns. Let me take a stab at the LRP -- long-range plans, what we call it. Thanks for that question, fair question. On the CapEx side, yes, it's higher. During this period, last year, we didn't have enough for exploration and to improve our exploration business, we need to build a portfolio that allows us a mixture of lower risk and higher risk throughout the year and also lower risk and high risk as to cost. These big 33,000 foot wells in the Gulf are very expensive. In other parts of the world, they're much less expensive. And on the risk side. We have a much lower risk exploration portfolio this year. So we've added over $40 million a year during this 3-year period for exploration. On the cash flow side, we've lowered our gas prices in the plan that's footnoted and we're also executing a $300 million project in Vietnam. And it's just a relook at the cost. And if you look at production, let's just be honest, Terra Nova is supposed to be up and running last March, it's not. And then you have to start off now and ramp that up. St. Malo incredible field just drilled an incredible production well there. The oil in place at St. Malo continues to increase, probably one of the top assets in the world, but the project is very late. So the CapEx has been spent. The production has been delayed. They're just now putting on the water injection equipment. So when you add all this up, you have a similar production result, but very, very same on oil. Very similar on the oil side to last year and more spending. But our 2027, 2028, 2029 is more robust and better than it was and leading to still a large amount of free cash flow approaching our yesterday market cap, in fact. And so there, we have it on that, Paul. But just every year, the plan gets better, things happen, things change in phasing. We deal with a lot of non-op big projects like Terra Nova and St. Malo and Lucius with Occidental (NYSE:OXY). And nothing's changed. We added up, put it back together. But at the end of the day, production is an outcome, and we're focusing on free cash flow and returning to shareholders and we have an outstanding ability to have free cash flow very similar to last year's plan. So we focus on that, not the little ins and outs on small variances in production. That's an outcome for us, not an input. So my treasurer tell me that yesterday, great line. So that's what we're doing on that, Paul.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you.\nRoger Jenkins: Appreciate all the years. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Charles Meade from Johnson Rice. Please ask your question.\nRoger Jenkins: Good morning, Charles.\nCharles Meade: Good morning Roger, to you and your team. Thank you. Roger, I wanted to ask -- thanks for giving us that $300 million debt reduction target for 2024 and we can do that math that will get you to Murphy 3.0, but you could start on that today with just the cash on your balance sheet. So can you -- can you give us some insight on how you're thinking about the timing of that $300 million in debt reduction?\nRoger Jenkins: It will be later this year and throughout the year. But I'll let Tom walk you through that, Charles a little bit here.\nThomas Mireles: Yes, Charles, thanks for that question. As Roger said, we'll be planning to utilize more of our adjusted free cash flow towards the second half of the year. We do have a little over $300 million of cash coming into the year. That's a balance that we try to hold just to manage our business, some of our operational needs and our international and domestic activities. So we like to try to keep that cash balance around $300 million to $350 million for those needs. As you may have noticed coming into 2023 last year, we had a little over $400 million of cash, and we did use some of that towards our framework as we got into the year. But as I mentioned to Paul's question, we try to manage this on an annual basis, this framework. And I think we'll see more of that happening for the second half of the year.\nCharles Meade: That is helpful, Tom. And then Roger, I wanted to ask about these two Gulf of Mexico prospects that you added Orange [ph] I think -- I didn't -- I don't remember the other. Ocotillo -- if I'm doing the math right, it looks to me after you mentioned the $120 million of net mean after taking away the Vietnam prospects. It looks like these two Gulf of Mexico prospects are in the range of $20 million to $30 million gross. And I wondered if that's the -- if I'm doing the math right there. And if you could just talk a little bit about the timing of those prospects and what they look like and what the development time line would be if you get on that success lag?\nRoger Jenkins: I think they're a little bigger than that. I believe they're in the 40s range. A story there. It's a long story. We just drilled this well so. It's a disappointing well that we disclosed earlier. But our team is doing a great job. We have a great team. We have a new enhanced team here, and people want to trade and be in our business. So when we drilled Oso for people to come into that well, Occidental, a close relationship with them, OXY. We were able to get into two of their prospects for them joining ours. We also have a very nice acreage position near Delta House. We recently did a large land trade where people want to come into our acreage, and we build into a portfolio of other wells. So we're using our prospects to gain entry into other prospects, meaning people believe our prospects are good. As a matter of fact, we're doing extremely well in trading in and out and building a really nice portfolio, Chris Olson, our exploration leader, and our land team is doing a great job pulling all that together for us. These are -- again, I spoke to Paul Cheng a few minutes ago about the risk of the program on occasion, you end up with a higher risk program year-to-year, I consider this year lower risk. These are amplitude type plays near one of Oxy's very successful fields can be tied back very closely to where they work. These would be near-field tieback, totally different from Oso, totally different from other things that we drilled in the past. So this year, we have some lower risk, lower cost not its deep and tough wells, if you will, and some really nice wells in Vietnam that we've been on the sidelines in Vietnam for a long time until we made plans with our field development plan with that host government, now the host government is very interested and us moving forward, that's going extremely well. So they're smaller wells, they're lower risk. With a great partner, they come from acreage situations that we put together. And in Vietnam, we're back in an area that's been on hold for us. So that's kind of a fast wrap-up of what we got going on there, Charles.\nCharles Meade: That\u2019s helpful detail. Thank you Roger.\nRoger Jenkins: Thank you, appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Tim Rezvan from KeyBanc Capital Mortgage. Please ask your question.\nRoger Jenkins: Good morning, Tim. How\u2019re doing?\nTimothy Rezvan: I am well. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to dig back into the Eagle Ford. You have a clear, as a company, a long-term growth and income approach, there's inherent variability in your Gulf business. So I'm trying to understand why with the uplift in productivity from new completions, why not run more of a continuous program in the Eagle Ford. It's hard to think that, that wouldn't compete for capital, especially given the comments you've given about the high-spec rigs. So just curious on that.\nRoger Jenkins: We focus on our offshore business typically first because these are infrastructures that need to be used. And on a pure return basis, the returns are better. But on a risk basis, it's different and the outcomes. It's not quite as volatile as you say, we've had three really strong years of work in the Gulf made enormous billions and billions of free cash flow in our Gulf business. So we just want to hold it in here and use it later if our Gulf business, our offshore business declines. It's a big advantage. We're showing a plan to our Board to produce past 2050 with assets that we own without any M&A or any exploration success. So we're a little different animal there. And we're trying to get our balance sheet in great shape. But I'll let Eric give you a little better color than that on this choice of capital allocation.\nEric Hambly: Yes. I think Roger, you're right on. I mean the returns for offshore projects are typically higher than our Eagle Ford. And we like our Eagle Ford, we have great returns. We have highlighted in our slides here, how many years of great inventory we have. And we do really like the optionality we have to maintain the scale of our business and the oily scale of our business for many decades by investing in the Eagle Ford in the future. What Roger briefly touched on was that in the offshore space, it's common that if you do not pursue an opportunity, the infrastructure where you can take that new well as a subsea tieback to a facility, the facility has a defined life. And it won't be there forever. And so you like the returns and you want to use it or lose it. In the Eagle Ford, that well is going to be waiting for us whenever we want it. So we like the flexibility that it provides for us. The other thing just to highlight that we have reduced our capital program in the Eagle Ford over the last few years and have generated strong free cash flows, which we've used to delever and return more money to shareholders, which we think is valued by our shareholders.\nRoger Jenkins: We have the Eagle Ford for long-term, and we have it when we need it. We can change capital allocation on the dime here in 30 minutes. We can change cap allocation. So we're proud to have it. I think it's going to become more and more valuable. And I think all of our onshore assets will become more and more valuable with the scarcity of the peers in that group that only do that business decline over the next decade. There's very valuable assets in both Canada and the Eagle Ford.\nTimothy Rezvan: Okay. I appreciate the color on that. On my follow-up, if I could pivot to Vietnam. You're allocating $40 million to the exploration wells this year. You did book the 13 million barrels of pud reserves. Can you talk about the assumptions behind those reserve bookings? Is that strictly based on that? I'm just trying to understand kind of what the upside could be from the exploration wells and how that impacted the reserves you booked and just kind of overview on how that -- the other play there?\nEric Hambly: Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll just give you a quick run through of our overall Vietnam business and how we think about it. We really like this Lac Da Vang project that we're working on now. Just getting started. We're going to spend $40 million net to us on the CapEx in development project for this year. And as Roger highlighted earlier, there'll probably be somewhat close to double that in 2025 and 2026, first oil in 2026. It's a nice development, 10,000 to 15,000 barrels net to us, but we would like to have a bigger business that's more material there, and we're fortunate to have excellent exploration prospects very close to our existing infrastructure that we're building out for Lac Da Vang. We're spending a little bit less on the exploration wells than you mentioned. I think you might have switched the development cost with exploration costs. So our exploration well cost is kind of in the $30 million to $35 million net range, and they're very sizable, very exciting prospects in the Cuu Long Basin. We haven't drilled a dry hole. It's very oily. It provides almost all the oil in Vietnam. And there may be some development synergies. One of the fields -- one of the prospects for drilling in the Block 15105 is particularly close to our LDV development. So on success, the ability to bring that field online faster than otherwise is an advantage from making money perspective from a free cash flow generating perspective. And then the prospect in the 15.2 is very sizable, very material for us. And could have the potential that our overall business in Vietnam could be a 30,000 to 40,000 net BOE a day business, which will be a really great piece of business for us there and generate tremendous amounts of free cash flow going forward. So we're super excited about it and look forward to giving you an update on the results of those Vietnam wells in the second half of 2024.\nTimothy Rezvan: Thank you very much.\nRoger Jenkins: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you.[Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Please ask your question.\nRoger Jenkins: Good morning, Roger. Good to hear from you.\nRoger Read: Thanks. Good to hear you all. Getting us started here with the E&P earnings season. Just -- I think my question comes at you from kind of the capital allocation. It's been danced around a little bit. But looking at the fact you're an exploration company, you've stuck with exploration through all the environments, you are even in the case, I think it was Zephyrus buying into an existing discovery. So you step back, Roger, you look at your options here, acquisition, exploration, buyback your shares, how does all of that fit in when you're doing the true evaluation here? Like which one looks the best, which one -- how do you think about them competing over the course of, say, the next five years as you look out at your long-range program?\nRoger Jenkins: Thanks for that question, Roger. I appreciate that. The way we think about it is you have to have some level of exploration spending if you're an E&P company or if not, you're just a peak company. And so we have raised that because we need to build a better portfolio for the long-term value of the company. When I think of sustainability, we have all the attributes of all the ESG sustainability. We ranked top in ISS, ranked number 1 by every ranker, lowest emissions, incredible focus and all that. But to me, sustainability is having that in an asset base that last for decades. As I mentioned on a prior call, our Board has seen a production forecast past 2050 with the assets that we own today. So we like to augment those assets with more oil-weighted exploration and not become a totally gas company because we have tees and tees of gas in the Montney. So we feel that at a 10% level of CapEx, 8% to 10% level of CapEx, we can build a long-term lower risk exploration portfolio that doesn't have -- that evens out the risk profile for the year, which we just talked about here with the previous caller. So we have that. Our buyback of stock is very, very good allocation of capital as well. And we disclosed the framework that we're quite serious about. And if you look at the actual data, it would within 1% or 2% of that execution on our first year. So we measure all that through and focus on free cash flow. So what we want to build and what we have between now and 2028 is -- I'm looking at all the free cash flow every year from 2024 to 2029. We make $1 billion a year or more every year of free cash flow. So we're doing that with the assets we own then we can augment that with exploration last longer and longer and longer at that same oil weighting and still have all of our onshore assets there to back us up to last for decades and decades. We're not going out of business at Murphy. We're sustaining our company through the capital allocation process that we have. And along the way, we're going to be able to buy a lot of stock. One of the key advantages of Murphy because we never issued equity since we went public in the 50s, we only have 154 million shares. So we can buy 5% or 6% of the company every year without any problem at all. So just a different animal. I'll show all this business today about our incredible balance sheet and our shareholders today have $1.20 a share dividend, the same as 2016 with way less net debt. So we're protected not to lower our dividend anymore. That's what we wanted to do, and we want to have the balance sheet in another cycle to pounce on M&A. And that's how we look at it. From an M&A perspective in the Gulf, we did buy a very nice situation. It's getting better, we believe, on subsurface. We occasionally look at prospects near our infrastructure, we could then flow those barrels to us. We don't have that deal done. We'll need to compete, but we're the top operator in the Gulf, high-uptime in the Gulf, highest record in the Gulf. People want to flow to us. And that's an opportunity for us to make an incredible high rate of return. And people want us in their project, even though we're not opt to help along the way with our expertise. So things come to us. We get to look at every deal and that we're extremely well positioned, Roger, to be honest with you.\nRoger Read: I appreciate that. I'll leave it there given the busy morning here. Thank you Roger.\nRoger Jenkins: Thank you, appreciate. See you soon.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Please ask your question.\nNeil Mehta: Good morning Roger. I'll just ask 1 because I know we're over time, which is just...\nRoger Jenkins: Neil, you\u2019re Goldman Sachs. Can you ask anything you want as long as you want.\nNeil Mehta: Thank you. It was great to have you in Miami. My only question for you is just the balance sheet, you've done a terrific job getting leverage down here. You are one notch -- I believe below investment grade. When you're having conversations with Moody's (NYSE:MCO), S&P and Fitch, what's their message about what needs to be done to get you over the finish line to get to that investment grade? And is that a priority? Is that important for you?\nRoger Jenkins: I think I'm going to let Tom answer that. The priority to me is we meet with our Board as we have a red light, green light, yellow on everything that Moody's requires. We focus on are we meeting investment-grade criteria. That's our first step. I'm focused on free cash flow every day, all day, and I'll let Tom talk to you about Moody's here. He's expert on that.\nThomas Mireles: Thanks, Roger. Yes, Neil, the way we're thinking about it, we really can't control how these rating agencies might change what's most important, what's our priority. We've been investment grade before we operate like an investment-grade company in terms of our decision-making. We are getting back to our conservative balance sheet, which we've had a long history of having a conservative balance sheet. And so that's how we intend to operate. When we talk to them, we tick a lot of their boxes. I think the theme that we're seeing by some other operators and some other activity in the industry is around scale. We don't think that, that's something that is going to push us into doing anything. We think we're at the right side, execute most beneficially for our shareholders. And so while we are one notch below, it's not limiting our ability to execute our plan. And we think we have ample access to capital to continue to provide the types of returns that our shareholders are expecting.\nNeil Mehta: Alright guys, thanks so much.\nRoger Jenkins: Thank you, Neil. Thanks for hanging in to the end, and we'll be seeing you soon. Appreciate it.\nRoger Jenkins: Okay. That's the end of our call today. We had a lot of robust calls for many of our long-term analysts. We appreciate that. We're first out in E&P today. We're glad to have it behind us, and we wish all of our peers as well as they go through it going forward. We're very well positioned, very safe balance sheet, ever-increasing dividend and focus on our shareholders. I'm very proud of the company, very proud of my team, very proud of what we have going on here. I appreciate everyone's focus this morning. It's been a long call. Thanks so much. See you soon. Goodbye.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now ended. Thank you all for joining. You may all disconnect.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor. For more information see our T&C."

NextEra Energy has strong operational and financial performance at both FPL and Energy Resources in 2023. NextEra Energy delivered full year adjusted earnings per share of $3.17, up over 9% from 2022, exceeding the high end of our adjusted EPS expectations range. From solar supply chain challenges to higher inflation and interest rates, NextEra Energy navigated through a challenging environment for the last two years, delivering compound annual adjusted EPS growth of roughly 11.5% since 2021. These were unprecedented events for our sector and clear headwinds for renewables, but disruption often presents opportunity. At NextEra Energy, we relied on our 25 years of renewables experience and our culture of execution to navigate this tough environment. On the strengths of our scale and competitive advantages, our world class supply chain capabilities, customer relationships, access to and cost of capital advantages, the strength of our balance sheet, our data driven development playbook, and our team just to a name few we successfully manage through the disruption. Our scale and competitive advantages served as key differentiators and allowed us to continue to deliver for our customers and extend our long track record of earnings and dividend growth. Over the past 10 years, we have delivered compound annual growth and adjusted EPS of roughly 10%, which is the highest among all top 10 power companies. Over that same period, the remaining top 10 power companies have achieved, on average, compound annual growth and adjusted EPS of roughly 2%. Notwithstanding the strong adjusted EPS results, we recognize and are disappointed by the underperformance in the share price. And as we start 2024, we remain steadfast in our continued focus on execution and creating long-term value for shareholders. We believe that disruption over the last two years has made NextEra Energy an even stronger company. Our business model is more resilient, our development platform is even more advanced, and our supply chain is more diversified than it has ever been. Bottom line, we believe NextEra Energy is well positioned headed into 2024. And there is good reason for optimism at NextEra Energy. Although nobody can predict with certainty what 2024 will bring, inflation and interest rates have declined from their peak, and NextEra Energy has taken steps to mitigate its exposure to interest rate volatility through its interest rate hedging program. The Commerce Department has provided the final determination around circumvention, providing solar suppliers with more certainty around the rules and expectations of importing solar equipment. New solar supply chains have been established in the U.S. and internationally, leading to lower solar panel prices, and we see the continued longer-term push towards EVs as being incrementally positive for continued reductions in battery prices. Solar panel and battery prices have already declined by roughly 25% from their peak over the last 24 months, heading into 2024. We have proactively procured critical electrical equipment to complete our renewable projects, securing enough transformers and breakers to cover our expected build through 2027. And due to our scale and construction partnerships, we have not experienced any labor shortages impacting project timelines. Ultimately, all these tailwinds are great for customers, and we believe should drive greater renewables demand in 2024 and beyond, all on the heels of consecutive record years for new renewables originations at Energy Resources in 2022 and 2023, totaling over 17 gigawatts. NextEra Energy offers a unique value proposition with two strong businesses that we believe are strategically positioned with outstanding prospects for future growth. FPL, which represents more than two thirds of our company, is the nation's largest electric utility and continues to deliver what we believe is the best customer value proposition and one of the fastest growing states in the US. Energy Resources, the world's renewables leader, has differentiated itself in an industry in which scale, experience, and being well capitalized matters. At NextEra Energy, the plan is simple. Our two businesses are deploying capital in renewables and transmission for the benefit of customers, providing visible growth opportunities for shareholders. At FPL, we identify investment opportunities that drive value for customers and support Florida's growing economy while keeping bills approximately 30% lower than the national average. We focus on running the business efficiently and continue to lead the industry with the lowest nonfuel O&M per megawatt hour of any large utility in the nation. Our emphasis on modernizing FPL's generation fleet to improve efficiency and reduce fuel costs has saved customers over $15 billion since 2001. We continue this trend in 2023 by placing into service approximately 1, 200 megawatts of cost effective solar and expect to add roughly 4, 800 megawatts over the current rate agreement. And by 2032, we expect to increase FPL's solar from 5% of our total generation today to roughly 35% by adding over 15, 000 incremental megawatts. We are also continuing to invest in FPL's grid to make it stronger and more resilient for our customers. Almost all of FPL's transmission system has been hardened with concrete or steel towers or poles, and we continue to invest in undergrounding our distribution system to further enhance reliability and resiliency for customers. The capital plan of the current rate agreement of $32 billion to $34 billion extends our customer value proposition and provides clear visibility for growth through 2025. Beyond 2025, we continue to believe FPL is strategically well positioned as Florida remains one of the fastest growing states in the U.S. with a population growth that is expected to roughly double the national average through 2030. Florida's economy is also growing and is now the 14th largest in the world if Florida were a country. FPL is responsible for keeping the lights on for approximately $2 billion per day of Florida's GDP. These long-term growth prospects coupled with investment opportunities and renewables and transmission and distribution infrastructure enhance our best-in-class customer value proposition and support our belief that FPL is the highest quality rate regulatory utility in the country. Energy Resources' deep expertise in renewables and transmission serves as a key differentiator with customers. As a result of our data-driven development playbook, Energy Resources had a record year of new renewables and storage origination, adding approximately 9, 000 megawatts to our backlog. Driven in part by the roughly 5, 600 megawatts placed in service in 2023, Energy Resources grew adjusted earnings almost 13% versus 2022. Energy Resources continues to see strong demand and is well positioned to realize its development expectations over the four year period ending 2026. Assuming we achieve the midpoint of the range, Energy Resources will be operating a roughly 63 gigawatt renewable portfolio by the end of 2026. That would be larger than the installed renewables capacity of all but nine countries. Energy Resources also is extending its excellent track record of optimizing our existing footprint to create additional shareholder value. To date, we have repowered six gigawatts of our existing 24 gigawatt wind operating fleet, investing roughly 50% to 80% of the cost of a new build and starting a new 10 years of production tax credits, resulting in attractive returns for shareholders. By 2026, Energy Resources' wind footprint could be roughly 32 gigawatts, and with over a decade to potentially qualify for repowering, it represents a great opportunity set. We believe there are multiple opportunities to drive value from the existing footprint, multiple wind repowers, adding solar underneath existing wind and locating battery storage with existing wind and solar. And we have dedicated teams leveraging our development playbook to optimize our existing and future fleet. We can maximize existing land, permits, interconnection capacity, and operations to provide enhanced value to customers and shareholders. By 2026, Energy Resources could operate up to 53 gigawatts of generation with the potential to co-locate battery storage, which represents a great long-term opportunity, especially considering the likely future capacity needs of customers. Throughout 2023, Energy Resources also continue to build what we believe is the nation's leading competitive transmission business. As growth and renewables occur throughout the U.S., there is a growing imperative to build additional or upgrade existing transmission. 2023 was a record year for our competitive transmission business. NextEra Energy transmission was awarded projects to construct transmission in PJM, CAISO and SPP that would roughly double the investments made in the existing business. We anticipate deploying approximately $1.9 billion of capital through 2027 to complete these transmission projects, which we estimate could enable up to 12 gigawatts of new renewables. Beyond 2026, Energy Resources is strategically positioned to benefit significantly from the irreversible shift towards electrification. With renewables only comprising roughly 16% of the U.S. generating mix, Energy Resources is just getting started. Renewable penetration is expected to double to over 30% by 2030, and Energy Resources is ready. We have a substantial development pipeline, including roughly 150 gigawatts of interconnection queue positions for new renewables and storage projects. We believe Energy Resources has the most comprehensive renewable energy business in the world and is better positioned than ever to capitalize on long-term growth prospects. FPL and Energy Resources individually have executed well, delivering value for our customers, both businesses complement each other, push one another to be better, and together create scale and foster innovation. We have one of the sectors strongest balance sheets and constructed and placed in the service roughly 6, 800 megawatts of new renewables and storage projects in 2023. To put that into context, 6, 800 megawatts of installed U.S. renewable generating capacity is enough on its own to rank as the fourth largest U.S. renewable energy company and the 14th largest utility. Turning to NextEra Energy Partners, we continue to focus on executing against the partnership's transition plans and delivering an LP distribution growth target of 6% through at least 2026. Last September, we made the tough decision to reduce the target distribution growth rate to 6% when NextEra Energy Partners no longer benefited from a competitive cost to capital. With a growth rate now comparable to its peers, we are focused on the partnership's cost to capital improving, which is critical for its future success. Towards that end, we are evaluating alternatives to address the remaining convertible equity portfolio financings with equity buyout obligations in 2027 and beyond. We are executing against the transition plans and with the closing of the Texas Pipeline portfolio sale, the partnership has addressed two of the three near-term convertible equity portfolio financings. The STX Midstream convertible equity portfolio financing has been extinguished and we have sufficient proceeds available to complete the NEP Renewables to buyouts that are due in June 2024 and 2025. The third convertible equity portfolio financing associated with the Meade natural gas pipeline assets is expected to be addressed in 2025. Looking ahead to 2024 and beyond, NextEra Energy Partners does not expect the need and acquisition in 2024 to meet the 6% growth and LP distributions per unit target and the partnership does not expect to require growth equity until 2027. We are executing against the growth plans and have identified approximately 985 megawatts of wind repowers through 2026 making progress against our expectations. As we turn the page on 2023 and head into 2024, we are optimistic about the renewable sector, about our opportunity set, about customer demand, and about NextEra Energy\u2019s future. Demand for renewables has never been stronger, and yet the challenges have never been more complex, making the stakes even higher for customers. Our scale and competitive advantages are enabling us to be the partner of choice with both power and commercial and industrial customers. On March 14th, we will discuss Energy Resources development process in greater detail at our Development Investor event in Juno Beach and illustrate how our proprietary tools differentiate Energy Resources with customers. And then on June 11th, we will hold our NextEra Energy Investor Day in New York to discuss our long-term plans for both Energy Resources and FPL. Our optimism for NextEra Energy's future flows from the strength of our two world class businesses, FPL and Energy Resources, that leverage our scale and competitive advantages to differentiate themselves as leaders. Our optimism is driven from our proven playbooks of deploying capital and renewables and transmission to create value for customers. But I am most optimistic because we have spent the last two decades building a world class team at NextEra Energy, and it is, by far, our greatest competitive strength. Our team lives and breathes a culture of continuous improvement working together to solve the tough challenges of the day. We drive innovation relying on data analytics and automation to make better decisions, and we have developed and deployed smart, low cost, clean energy solutions that lead our industry. Most importantly, our team remains hyper focused on continuing our long track record of execution, serving our customers with excellence and providing long term value for shareholders. With that let me turn it over to Kirk who will review the 2023 results in more detail.\nKirk Crews: Thanks John. Let's begin with FPL's detailed results. For the full year 2023 FPL's adjusted earnings per share increased $0.22 versus 2022. FPL's adjusted earnings results exclude the approximately $300 million after tax gain on the sale of Florida City Gas which closed on November 30th 2023. The principal driver of the 2023 full year performance was FPL's regulatory capital employed growth of approximately 12.5%. We continue to expect FPL's average annual growth and regulatory capital employed to be roughly 9% over the four year term of our current rate agreement, which runs through 2025. For the full year 2023, FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.8%. During the full year 2023, we used approximately $227 million of reserve amortization, leaving FPL with a yearend 2023 balance of roughly $1.2 billion. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing its full year capital investments to a total of roughly $9.4 billion. These capital investments supported the successful commissioning of roughly 1, 200 megawatts of solar in 2023, continued hardening of the grid, and our efforts to underground our distribution system. During the fourth quarter of 2023, our 25 megawatt hydrogen pilot at the Okeechobee Clean Energy Center successfully achieved commercial operations. As a reminder, we plan to utilize this facility together with adjacent solar projects to create green hydrogen and blend it with natural gas at our Okeechobee plant. Key indicators show that the Florida economy remains strong and Florida's population continues to be one of the fastest growing in the country. Florida's economy continues to trend upward, and its GDP is now roughly $1.6 trillion, an increase of 9.3% over last year. For the fourth quarter of 2023, FPL's retail sales increased 1.6% from the prior year on a weather normalized basis, driven primarily by continued strong customer growth, which increased by nearly 81, 000 from the prior year comparable quarter. For the full year 2023, FPL retail sales increased 0.6% from the prior year on a weather normalized basis, also driven primarily by the strong customer growth in our service territory. Now, let's turn to Energy Resources, which reported full year adjusted earnings growth of approximately 12.9% year-over-year. Contributions from new investments increased by $0.35 per share due to strong growth in our renewables and storage portfolio. Contributions from our existing clean energy assets decreased results by $0.11 per share, driven primarily by the impact of weaker wind resource. 2023 was the lowest wind resource on record over the past 30 years. Our customer supply and trading business increased results by $0.16 per share, primarily due to higher margins in our customer facing businesses. Other decreased results by $0.26 per share year-over-year. This decline reflects higher interest costs of $0.22 per share, of which $0.10 was driven by new borrowing costs to support new investments. Energy Resources delivered our best year ever for origination, adding approximately 9, 000 megawatts of new renewables and battery storage projects to our backlog, which includes approximately 2, 060 megawatts since our last call. Our 2023 origination performance reflects continued strong demand from power customers looking for the least cost alternative to serve load and to replace uneconomic generation and commercial and industrial customers looking to help decarbonize their operation or meet their data center and AI demand. Our renewables backlog now stands at more than 20 gigawatts after taking into account roughly 2, 470 megawatts of new projects placed into service since our third quarter call. We believe our 20 gigawatt backlog provides clear visibility and Energy Resources\u2019 ability to deliver for shareholders through 2026 and beyond. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the full year adjusted earnings from our corporate and other segment decreased by $0.08 per share year-over-year, primarily driven by higher interest costs. We successfully supported the growth in our underlying businesses from our strong operating cash flows, including the sale of tax credits as well as our historical funding sources. In 2023, we grew cash flow from operations well in excess of our adjusted earnings. We transferred approximately $400 million of tax credits, establishing relationships with numerous counterparties. We believe this will prove to be a competitive advantage as buyers look first to NextEra Energy given its size, experience, and the overall quality of its tax credit program. Overall, our funding plans for 2024 through 2026 remain consistent with the information we shared on the third quarter earnings call. We continue to believe NextEra Energy is well positioned to manage the interest rate environment. While the recent decline in interest rates is encouraging, we remain committed to managing the business to deliver value for customers and shareholders. Overall, we believe we are well positioned with $18.5 billion of interest rate swaps and we will continue to closely monitor the interest rate environment as the clients and rates certainly represent a tail end for our sector and customers. Our long-term financial expectations remain unchanged. We will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted EPS expectation ranges in 2024, 2025, and 2026. For the last 14 consecutive years, NextEra Energy has met or exceeded its financial expectation, which is a record we are proud of. From 2021 to 2026, we continue to expect that our average annual growth and operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. And we also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least 2024 off a 2022 base. As always, our expectations assume our caveats. Now let's turn to NextEra Energy Partners. In terms of the transition plans, NextEra Energy Partners closed the sale of Texas pipeline portfolio in late December, providing net proceeds of approximately $1.4 billion. NextEra Energy Partners expect to complete the NEP Renewables II buyouts of roughly $190 million and $950 million on their stated minimum buyout dates of June 2024 and 2025, respectively, as the partnerships continue to benefit from the low cash coupon through 2025. In terms of NextEra Energy Partners ' growth plan, as a reminder, it involves organic growth, specifically repowerings of approximately 1.3 gigawatt of wind projects through 2026, as well as acquiring assets at attractive yields. Today, we are announcing plans to repower an additional approximately 245 MW of wind facilities through 2026. The partnership has now announced roughly 985 MW of repowers with strong cash available for distribution yields. While the partnership does not expect to need an acquisition in 2024, the LP distribution growth target of 6% is supported, in part with roughly 175 MW of wind repowers, which are expected to generate attractive cash available for distribution yields. Finally, we were pleased with the high yield note issuance of $750 million, which was completed during the fourth quarter of 2023. This opportunistic refinancing allowed the partnership to pay off its corporate revolver in mid-December. Let me now turn to the financial results for NextEra Energy Partners. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $454 million, and cash available for distribution was $86 million. Adjusted EBITDA growth versus the prior year comparable quarter was primarily due to new asset additions and the incentive distribution's right fee suspension, while cash available for distribution was also impacted by incremental debt service. For the full year 2023, adjusted EBITDA was approximately $1.9 billion, up 13.6% year-over-year, and was primarily driven by the contribution for new projects acquired in late 2022 and during 2023 and the Incentive Distribution Right Fee Suspension. New investments added approximately $228 million and the Incentive Distribution Right Fee Suspension added approximately $113 million of adjusted EBITDA year-over-year. This growth was partially offset by a decline from existing projects driven primarily by weaker wind resource. Cash available for distribution was $689 million for the full year and primarily driven by contributions from new projects of approximately $42 million and the Incentive Distribution Right Fee Suspension of $113 million while being partially offset by the weaker wind resource. Yesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.88 per common unit or $3.52 per unit on an annualized basis, which reflects an annualized increase of 6% from its third quarter 2023 distribution per unit. The partnership grew its LP distributions per unit by more than 8% year-over-year. From an updated base of our fourth quarter 2023 distribution per common unit and an annualized rate of $3.52, we continue to see 5% to 8% growth per year in LP distributions per unit with a current target of 6% growth per year as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2026. We continue to expect the partnership payout ratio to be in the mid-90s through 2026. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2024 distribution that is payable in February 2025 to be $3.73 per common unit. NextEra Energy Partners is introducing December 31, 2024 run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA in a range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion and cash available for distribution in a range of $730 million to $820 million reflecting calendar year 2025 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year end 2024. As a reminder, our expectations are subject to our caveat. That concludes our prepared remarks and with that, we will open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Shahriar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners.\nShahriar Pourreza: Good morning, guys. Just starting on NEP, if it's okay, just on the higher repowering opportunities you announced, I guess how are you sort of thinking about funding it? And really more importantly, is there any specific status on the money pool that could be looking to buy in directly into projects, whether it's dropdowns or organic growth at the NEP level? Could these sort of equity investors help solved the \u201826 growth and financing issues? And I guess when do you plan to update on that?\nKirk Crews: Sure. So with respect to repowering, Shahr, we look at that as on the project level. There are really two options there. We can look at it from a project financing standpoint and pair that with transferability, or we can look at it as tax equity. So we will look at both of those options and decide that at the time of the repowerings. With respect to your second question, there's, we're looking at all options right now, as John said, in the prepared remarks. We are exploring a number of opportunities and alternatives for addressing the convertible equity portfolio financing that are coming due in 2027 and beyond. There's really not a timeframe in terms of the update now, but we are looking at all options and with the goal of really maximizing unit holder value.\nShahriar Pourreza: Got it.\nJohn Ketchum: And Shahr, this is John, just adding on to that again, on the repowers. Just like we do at the, I mean, just think about it as tax equity and project finance.\nShahriar Pourreza: Got it. Okay.\nJohn Ketchum: And again, the private capital raises provide us with a number of options, but we're looking at a lot of different alternatives, that being one of them.\nShahriar Pourreza: Okay, perfect. And then lastly, John, we haven't had any updates from the FEC, has anything sort of been communicated to you regarding sort of the investigation how quickly you would look to settle, assuming they take up the case. And as we're kind of thinking about the process, right, it's confidential. So curious on how you're going to update investors, like would we see a press release or 8-K from you confirming the FEC process and that you'll update investors in the future on next steps, or could we see a single communication on the FEC pickup and a concurrent settlement, let's say? I'm just trying to assess how long this could be an overhang, assuming the case moves forward and whether you've already laid the groundwork for all options to get this kind of past this quick when a ruling comes out. Thank you.\nJohn Ketchum: Yes, thanks for the question, Shahr. So let me just take those in order. First of all, there's no update. We have not been contacted by the FEC. And I think just to remind investors of the timing, first of all, these are just guidelines I'm going to give you. I mean, there is no prescribed timeline in terms of the FEC providing a response to us. But as you may recall, we originally received the FEC complaint, I guess is what you would call it, that had been filed by a group called CREW back in November of 2022. And if you follow the historical precedent of the FEC, it's usually 12 to 18 months after you first are notified of a complaint having been filed, that you would learn whether or not the FEC decides to find that there's reason to believe that they ought to conduct an investigation. We have not heard anything from the FEC in that regard. The second thing I would remind investors of is this is not material again these were five allegations totaling political contributions of roughly $1.3 million to $1.5 million. So we're talking about smaller dollar amounts and how and when we would update investors would depend on what exactly we hear from the FEC.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research.\nSteve Fleishman: Yes, hi. Good morning. Thanks. I guess a couple of big picture questions. First, obviously a lot more focus in the elections now as we're in \u201824 and curious your thoughts in the event of Republican trifecta so to speak just how you're thinking about the sustainability of IRA provisions.\nJohn Ketchum: Sure, Steve. Let me go ahead and take that, this is John. First of all in the 21 years I've been at the company, as we've changed administrations and we've seen changes in Congress, we've never seen a change or appeal of tax credits. No matter what form they've taken, IRA is the form we're talking about here. So that's the first point I would make. Second, it's really hard to overturn existing law. I think Obamacare is a very good example of that. It's just very difficult no matter what the political wins are. The third point I would make is that the IRA benefits both sides of the aisle. It certainly is advantageous for obvious reasons for Democrats, but it also has a big benefit to Republicans. Because if you think about where the investments are being made around IRA and where a lot of the benefit of IRA is flowing, it's flowing to Republican states and it's flowing to parts of those states that are really difficult to stimulate economically. And we're talking about rural communities in these states. And so when we come in and we build a wind project, we build a solar project, we build a battery storage project, it's a complete turnaround for these communities. We're providing an economic base in the form of jobs. We're providing an economic base in the form of spending that occurs in that community. We're providing an economic base in the form of property taxes and sales tax revenues. These are 180s for these rural communities and make a huge difference on their viability going forward. Just think about hospitals and staffing doctors at county hospitals or teach -- paying teacher salaries. I mean, the property tax revenues have significant benefits. And so for those reasons, we've always been able to work with both sides of the aisle. So see any repeal of IRAs being unlikely.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. And I guess two other big picture questions on the renewable space. And it's just any kind of new thoughts color on your data center strategy and also your thoughts on hydrogen after the based on the proposed rules that came out.\nRebecca Kujawa: Good morning, Steve. It's Rebecca. First on the data centers, clearly there's an enormous amount of demand being driven across the U.S. economy by the growth in data centers, driven by a lot of things, of course, but specifically, generative AI, and that growth is pretty explosive at this point. And I think the characteristics of that demand are a little bit unique in driving different ways in approaching the marketplace for a number of these technology companies where it is imperative that these projects get built on time, on budget, and produce the energy that they're expecting because the opportunity cost for these customers is so significant if they aren't able to power them and, of course, meet the commitments that they've made to their own stakeholders. So we're seeing those relationships expand and also deepen, where it's not just signing the megawatts of the day, but also working with them collaboratively over a long period of time to ensure that they get the energy and capacity that they need where they needed to support their projects. Just alone in our backlog, not even counting what we have installed, we have over three gigawatts of projects that we're building in the coming years for these customers. And I do believe that's the tip of the iceberg. And again, not even talking about what we already have installed. So it's pretty exciting. And our team is very ingrained in working with these customers. And we're excited about the years ahead. And then turning to hydrogen, obviously the guidance that first came out, the draft guidance in December, is really steering towards hydrogen projects that will be essentially from day one, needing to match on an hourly basis. And that, of course, increases the ultimate cost of hydrogen. And unfortunately, I think if it stands as currently drafted, would limit to an extent how much will be built for the U.S. market. We're obviously advocating more of a relaxed matching requirements of more of an annual match for a period of time and then transitioning to hourly over time so that you can kick start a hydrogen market. And hopefully the administration will hear that and know that having a kick started hydrogen economy will certainly further their ambitious goals, which of course we are very excited about meeting to see the full decarbonization of the U.S. economy over time. So more work to be done and we are excited to pursue the marketplace. Regardless, these are probably end of the decade type projects, so more of an investment in the near term for opportunities in the long term.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Arcaro of Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Arcaro: Hey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question. Maybe on the renewables demand side of things, could you give a little bit more detail on the origination trends that you're seeing? I guess it looked like solar and storage quite strong in the quarter, but then wind a little bit lower in terms of the new bookings added. Maybe what's your latest confidence in achieving those \u201825 and \u201826 targets, particularly on the wind side of the business?\nRebecca Kujawa: Hey, David. It's Rebecca. I'll take a first cut at that. We're obviously excited about the origination, as John and Kirk have highlighted, originating 17 gigawatts over the last two years, and both years serving as a record, so this year topping last year's record is very exciting. We also, of course, see the mix being more focused towards solar and storage, and as I've commented in the past, I think some of this is an after effect of the strong demand that we saw going into 2020 when we and others thought that the production tax credit would ultimately phase down and then ultimately go to zero over a period of time, so there was a pull forward of demand. And then the second dynamic that I think has impacted the short term is that the solar production tax credit clearly stimulated near-term demand and deployments for our customers, and obviously we're very excited about that. Storage is growing at least as well as we thought, perhaps exceeding even our expectations in terms of adoption, not just in the Western markets, but now really spreading in a very constructive way through the Midwest, and we've got, as John highlighted in the prepared remarks, a really advantaged position to be able to respond quickly to the demand characteristics that we're seeing where our customers need capacity quickly, where they hadn't anticipated the demand that they would see in their underlying business. And so getting to market quickly is very much a premium and a priority, and we're there to serve them well. In that storage market, as we've talked about from a returns characteristic standpoint, it's an awful lot like wind, and it's certainly complex to deliver the value that our customers are looking for in the various streams. I'd say the other part that is at least as strong as we anticipated when we laid out the expectations is repowering. And we're excited about the economics of that and economics specifically in context to the value that it brings to our customers, bringing some incremental generation and extending the life of these projects, often extending the contracts with our customers at the same times that we do repowering. So overall, with all those comments in context, I feel really good about meeting our development expectations in aggregate. We'll continue to look at the mix in individual technologies over time. But at this point, we are obviously leaving the ranges as we've had them now for a couple of years, in part to reflect what I'm sure you recall, wind is a very short development cycle. Maybe not the actual laying the groundwork to be able to build a project, but when we enter into a contract and acquire the term and put it into service, it can be as short as nine months. So there's still a lot of time left between now and the end of \u201826 to add more wind to not only the backlog, but ultimately commission. And when I look at the forward couple of quarters, there are a couple of chunky opportunities that our teams are working on, and I feel good about bringing them some of those to fruition.\nDavid Arcaro: Excellent. Thanks for that. Very helpful. And then maybe secondarily, just it sounds like the backdrop has gotten more challenging for small developers in the renewable space, wondering if you're seeing opportunities for market share gain as a result, and potentially any development pipelines to pick up from developers that might be struggling right now.\nRebecca Kujawa: Sure. We always are out in the development right acquisition market. In the recent couple of years, we've really prioritized our greenfield portfolio, in part because of our ability to work so closely with our customers and make sure that we're building the projects over the long term where they need them. But we will always be opportunistic in the development project market to be selective and create opportunities where it may be particularly attractive. The dynamic from a couple of years ago where a number of the development portfolios were acquired by folks looking to, I would say, compete with us, but certainly have a bigger presence on the development side. We haven't seen those holistically come back to market. I think that may change over time. I know the private equity cycle of wanting to be able to turn over capital quickly and realize isn't necessarily completely aligned with the development cycle where sometimes things are a little bit faster or a little bit slower than you anticipated, and you need to be patient. So I'm optimistic there'll be opportunities. But most importantly, and this is one of the things that we'll focus on in March, is we want to keep our fate, our development opportunities in our own hands. And I am super excited about what our team is working on from a greenfield development standpoint and the competitive advantages that we're investing in to make sure that we can serve our customers well, not just in the next two or three years as we often talk about with you all, but the next five, seven, 10 years plus down the road.\nOperator: The next question comes from Carly Davenport of Goldman Sachs.\nCarly Davenport: Hey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking the questions. I wanted to just ask about transmission. You highlighted the $1.9 billion of capital through \u201827 at NEER. And as we look at the EBITDA contributions at NEER for 2024 that piece is moving higher as well. So could you just talk a bit about what sort of growth you could see at NEER over the next several years and what that EBITDA contribution could be over time?\nRebecca Kujawa: Good morning, Carly. So from the pipeline perspective, is no doubt you appreciate transmission opportunities take a couple of years to come to fruition. So we're thrilled with the awards that the team has been able to secure in the last year on one part of it, building on investments that we already have, so expansion opportunities that are significantly enabling new renewables development headed into the California market. And then other parts of the US competitive opportunities that we won through competitive processes. In terms of timing, as we highlighted in the prepared remarks, the in -service dates are out to 2027. So as we invest capital, obviously that'll start to become more of a material contribution over time. And we'll give more color as we get into the investor conference as we typically do to give more of a breakdown by business and what those contributions will look like over time. But the momentum is terrific. And as we've highlighted, everybody understands, maybe not to the extent that we think it's going to happen, but in order to unlock the renewables opportunity that we and others see across the United States, transmission needs to be built. And we stand ready to be a part of the solution wherever we can be and bring cost effective solutions to customers.\nCarly Davenport: Great, thank you for that. And then maybe just one more on the financing side for this year, just based on what you've seen so far in the markets, how are you thinking about the mix of the different avenues that you can use to monetize tax credits, whether through tax equity or transferability? How do we think about the sort of magnitude of each of those in your financing plans for \u201824?\nKirk Crews: Yes, Carly, this Kirk, the financing plan as we shared in our prepared remarks is consistent with the information, we shared on the third quarter call. And as we approach those options, we will use the historical approaches, project finance and tax equity. But we're also very encouraged by what we're seeing with the transferability market. We are having really good progress with, in those conversations, we're seeing really good demand for the NextEra Energy tax credit. And ultimately, we look at all those as options and will optimize between project finance and transferability and tax equity. And we'll use those within the ranges that we shared and the \u201824 to \u201826 funding plan that we provided between those -- between the disclosure that we provided. But we are seeing really good demand for the credits and expect to continue to utilize transferability as an option going forward.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to build off that a little bit as what you talked about before. How do you balance, I guess, looking forward the wealth of growth opportunities and associate funding needs relative to dividend growth? Do you look at industry trends for dividend growth at all and how that might change as utility CapEx increases and just a final point there, just wondering how the EMP business competes for capital against everything else that you have in a lower gas price environment.\nKirk Crews: Sure. So we, when we look at capital allocation and you look at, we shared on the third quarter call the returns that we see within the renewable business and as we shared then at Energy Resources within for when we see returns in the low 20s on a levered ROE basis. In solar, we see returns in the mid-teens and then storage is also in the low 20s. And so it's great returns and we look to get capital allocated to the renewable business. And that as John discussed in the prepared remarks, we are allocating capital across both businesses in renewables and transmission. And so that is the priority with the way that we allocate capital. And then in terms of the funding of that, again, it's the way that we've traditionally funded the business, it\u2019s tax equity, it\u2019s project finance, and then we also use the transferability provisions.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Thank you for that. And then maybe just pivoting a little bit towards the backlog. A lot of additions in the quarter, but there was a little bit of fell out, I think, 350 and there was a little bit more in the post 2026 timeframe that's in the backlog. So just wondering if you could talk a bit more on kind of some of the drivers, the puts and takes within the portfolio addition composition over time.\nRebecca Kujawa: Sure, I'll take that. In terms of the, obviously the backlog additions are quite strong and we're thrilled about that. And for this quarter, in terms of the removal that we had, it's really project specific items and one part is really related to higher interconnection costs for a particular project where we need to go back and do a little bit more work, very likely these project megawatts will come back into the backlog. They're good projects, but in near term we're removing them while we work through the issues. We, I think it's important to keep in mind that as we add something to the backlog, it's tremendous visibility and we're really excited about moving forward with the projects based on what we know at the time. But this is still a development business and there are things that you have to work through before you commit significant capital to a project and occasionally some of those things that we work through are better. Sometimes they're a little bit worse and we need to make the decisions that are ultimately right for our shareholders at the time that we need to make them. So in context of a 20 plus gigawatt portfolio, I think it's de minimis for what is kind of the normal run rate for development type issues. And fortunately we've worked through the issues that we had talked about over the last two years around anti -dumping, countervailing duties and the significant changes in the marketplace related to the inflationary pressures and changes in the interest rates. So at this point I think we're in kind of like normal development, every once in a while, there's something that changes our view on a specific project and we're going to do the right thing from a shareholder perspective and only commit capital where it makes sense.\nOperator: This concludes our question and answer session. The conference has now also concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

        "article_content": " \n\n \n\n \n\nQuiver Quantitative - Morgan Stanley (MS), a stalwart in the finance industry, is taking a significant leap forward in the private credit sector. With an ambitious goal to double its portfolio to an astounding $50 billion, the bank is channeling more than $300 million into this venture. Already boasting a $25 billion asset base, largely fueled by institutional investors, Morgan Stanley is poised to capitalize on a burgeoning market that has grown to a colossal $2 trillion. This strategic shift, initiated post-financial crisis, reflects a broader market trend where stringent banking regulations have paved the way for non-traditional lenders to thrive.\nIn this evolving landscape, private credit, especially direct lending, has become increasingly prominent. The vacuum left by traditional banks, now constrained by rigorous lending regulations, has been swiftly occupied by private lenders like Ares Management (NYSE:ARES), KKR, and Blackstone (NYSE:BX). These entities have adeptly filled the gap in financing debt-ridden companies, a domain once dominated by banks. This shift signifies a notable change in the financial fabric, reshaping how risky loans are financed.\nMarket Overview:\n-Morgan Stanley plans aggressive expansion in private credit, doubling its portfolio to $50 billion in the medium term.\n-Institutional investors remain the primary fuel source, with the bank already securing $25 billion in total assets.\n-Wall Street giants see private credit as a lucrative opportunity amid stricter regulations and rising interest rates.\n-Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan chase similar ambitions, allocating billions to the burgeoning market.\n-Lower rates and renewed bank competition may reshape the landscape, potentially squeezing private credit's share of large deals.\nKey Points:\n-The global private credit market, estimated at $2 trillion, has soared in recent years as traditional loan channels tightened.\n-Wall Street banks, like Morgan Stanley, see a goldmine in private credit, leveraging investor capital instead of their own balance sheets.\n-Morgan Stanley's expansion plans reflect the confidence in the sector's growth potential, despite potential headwinds from lower rates and renewed bank competition.\n-Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and other giants are also vying for a larger slice of the pie, allocating significant capital to private credit strategies.\nLooking Ahead:\n-The battle for market share in private credit is intensifying, with traditional banks expected to become more aggressive as interest rates drop.\n-Smaller and mid-sized deals could remain a sweet spot for private lenders, while consolidation in the large-deal space is a potential outcome.\n-The ultimate winners will depend on their ability to navigate changing market dynamics, -manage risk effectively, and deliver attractive returns to investors.\nMeanwhile, Wall Street banks are not far behind in adapting to this new reality. Goldman Sachs, for example, is on a quest to amass up to $50 billion in alternative funds, with a significant portion earmarked for private credit. Similarly, JPMorgan (JPM) has allocated $10 billion of its capital towards private credit and is actively courting outside investors to join the fray. This strategic move by these banking giants indicates a keen awareness of the evolving dynamics in the lending sphere.\nThis trend of increasing reliance on private credit is poised to undergo further shifts, particularly with expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts. Such changes could make traditional banks more competitive in loan markets, potentially recalibrating the balance between private and syndicated loans. Nevertheless, the growth trajectory of private credit seems secure, underscored by Morgan Stanley's robust expansion plans. Their initiative, integrating investment banking expertise with private lending acumen, is indicative of the sector's potential and the evolving landscape of finance.\nThis article was originally published on Quiver Quantitative"

This is the conference operator. Welcome to the NovaGold\u2019s 2023 Year-End Financial Results Conference Call and Webcast. As a reminder all participants are in a listen-only mode and the conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Melanie Hennessey, Vice President, Corporate Communications. Please go ahead.\nMelanie Hennessey: Thank you, Ayisha. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased that you have joined us for NovaGold\u2019s 2023 year-end financial results and for an update on the Donlin Gold project. On today\u2019s call, we have NovaGold\u2019s Chairman, Dr. Thomas Kaplan; Greg Lang, NovaGold\u2019s President and CEO; and David Ottewell, NovaGold\u2019s Vice President and CFO. At the end of the webcast, we will take questions by phone, Additionally, we will respond to questions received by email. I would like to remind you, as stated on Slide 3, any statements made today may contain forward-looking information such as projections and goals, which are likely to involve risks detailed in our various EDGAR and SEDAR filings and forward-looking disclaimers included in this presentation. I will now turn the presentation over to our President and CEO, Greg Lang. Greg?\nGreg Lang: Thank you, Melanie, and good morning, everyone. Ahead of providing a summary of our 2023 year-end results. I\u2019d like to start today\u2019s call with a brief overview on Slide 5, which explains why we and our shareholders consider Donlin Gold, a Tier 1 asset. Posting approximately 39 million ounces of gold at an impressive grade of more than twice the industry average at 2.25 grams and a projected mine life of almost 30 years, Donlin Gold bodes the potential to be a significant and cost-effective producer. Furthermore, outstanding exploration potential exists beyond the known resource areas, throughout Donlin\u2019s extensive land holdings. The project is also located on private land designated for mining in Alaska, a world-leading jurisdiction known for responsible mining practices. Our enduring partnerships and life of mine agreements with Calista and the TKC Corporation further position Donlin favorably on its path toward development. It is important to put into context the company\u2019s accomplishments since the reorganization in 2012. Especially for those who are new investors and less familiar with us. As shown on Slide 6, we have been focused on executing this strategy that was set in motion by our Chairman and me over a decade ago, mainly to unlock the value of NovaGold\u2019s high-quality assets for our shareholders and advance Donlin as a pure gold play we\u2019ll be offering a unique endowment and maximum leverage. Looking at Slide 7. Alaska offers an excellent environment for mining and is one of the world\u2019s safest jurisdictions. It ranks as the second largest gold producer in the U.S. with a well-defined permitting process. Numerous companies have achieved success here and the government is very supportive and recognizes the importance of responsible natural resource development. NovaGold\u2019s performance in the areas of environmental stewardship, health and safety, social and community engagement and corporate governance are featured on Slide 8. Health and safety of our people is our highest priority with over 10 years of zero lost time accidents at the project site. The workforce is comprised mostly of local hires. Throughout 2023, we will continue to monitor, reflect on and refine our environmental, social and governance performance, including maintaining strong records of environmental health and safety of Donlin and expanding our investments in partnerships with the people of the Y-K region. To touch on Donlin\u2019s attributes. As currently envisioned with approximately 39 million ounces, it holds one of the largest and highest grade undeveloped gold endowments in the world, one that would average over a million ounces a year for 27 years. When looking at the group of gold development projects in the Americas on Slide 9. Donlin Gold is by far the largest with global gold production continuing to decrease, it is clear the industry needs projects of scale, grade, and longevity to write out multiple price cycles. With a grade of more than twice the industry average for an open-pit project at 2.25 grams as shown on Slide 10, this in turn enables Donlin Gold to potentially become one of the lowest cost producers in the gold space. Excellent exploration potential exists beyond the defined resources located in the ACMA and Lewis deposits on the diagram in the upper right-hand corner, which occupies only three kilometers of an eight kilometer mineralized belt. As highlighted on Slide 11. Incredible potential remains to increase ounces and extend the mine life. As private landowners, both Calista and TKC are dedicated to developing Donlin Gold in a way consistent with the elders vision of responsible mining development while creating jobs and economic benefits for the surrounding communities as well as protecting the culture. A few quotes are provided from the leaders of both Alaska Native Corporations, TKC and Calista\u2019s knowledge and guidance has been critical over the years through permitting, sustainability and community engagement initiatives. We immensely appreciate their meaningful input regarding their land and the significant economic needs required to sustain healthy living for their communities. Our partners continued time-tested collaboration on the project with the \u2013 and their full engagement was extremely valuable ensuring sustainable economic development throughout all phases of the project. With these combination of attributes, Donlin Gold has the potential to form a cornerstone of economic, sustainable development for the Y-K region for many decades to come. I will now touch on the highlights accomplished by Donlin Gold last year as well as some of the ongoing activities. Turning to Slide 14, the 2023 field program at Donlin was safely completed on schedule in July with almost two-thirds of the direct hires coming from the Y-K region. The program included the completion of comprehensive field work and geotechnical drilling required for the Alaska Dam Safety certificates. This involved data collection at numerous locations earmarked for water retention structures and the tailings storage facility. Field work included drilling, water retention structure, seismic surveys and test plot liner installation. Additional field work included refining groundwater at the site with hydrogeologic drilling that provided essential information for mine planning and design. At the historic placer site, restoration work encompass significant stream and timed habitat creation, continued restoration work, will include anticipated aquatic life access planned for the 2024 field season. Furthermore with the support from both owners and third party consultants Donlin Gold continued to advance the geologic and resource models, advanced trade-off studies and conducted extensive analysis on key project assumptions and design components for validation, which will play a critical role, subsequent steps to advance the project to further up the value chain. Through ongoing cooperation with Calista, TKC and local communities, NovaGold upholds a steadfast commitment to education, community wellness, cultural preservation and environmental stewardship. These principles are actively reinforced not only at the Donlin Gold project site, but also in the Y-K communities, as highlighted on Slide 15. In 2023, Donlin Gold demonstrated this commitment by appointing additional community liaison representatives from four villages in the Y-K region, expanding the total to eight. Donlin Gold also established three additional shared value statements, totaling 16 formalizing ongoing engagement, reinforcing long-term relationships, with the communities in the region. Donlin also supported various search and rescue teams and provided funding to the Bethel Community Services Foundation and Special Olympics Alaska, just to name a few. We also concluded another successful \u201cIn It For The Long Haul\u201d backhaul program for the sixth year in a row. This vital project is dedicated to the collection, removal and safe disposal of household hazardous and electronic waste from the villages throughout the region preventing an adverse impact on landfills and waterways. This year\u2019s program achieved significant milestones, including the removal of waste from fish camps in the river and Donlin Gold employees from three villages played a key part in initializing the backhaul from the Yukon River. Furthermore, Donlin is collaborating with its Alaska Native partners on environmental initiatives, which include the monitoring and assessment of the conditions and management of salmon fisheries in the Kuskokwim and Yukon River watersheds. In the fourth quarter of 2023, specific project opportunities for salmon population health were identified. Additionally Donlin Gold supported the construction and maintenance of 300 miles of ice roads, fostering community engagement and providing essential access for emergency services. Donlin continues to support educational programs with a focus on enhancing opportunities through the Alaska Resource Education, and the Alaska School Activities Association and providing scholarships at the University of Alaska. Donlin Gold is a federally permitted project on private land designated by law for mining activities as part of the 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, differentiating factor for most other mining assets in Alaska. Permitting the United States and Alaska represents a significant and rigorous endeavor for success hinges on years of dedicated efforts to ensure a diligent, transparent and inclusive process for all stakeholders. Slide 16 is all the federal and state permits and certificates received to date. We have received our federal permits from the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Land Management 2018, followed by numerous state permits on this slide and subsequent years. Donlin Gold, its owners and partners possess an intimate understanding of the project\u2019s permitting and regulatory procedures and remain committed supporting the federal and state agencies and defending such a rigorous permitting process. On Slide 17, we present updates regarding state and federal permitting and litigation activities. None of these actions are surprised, and we were prepared and have prevailed in the course [ph]. The 2023 field program was focused on geotechnical and hydrologic drilling together supplementary data for the dam safety certificates. The field work concluded in July, and the team is on track to submit the preliminary design packages to the state in the first half of 2024. On September 1, 2023, the Alaska Superior Court reaffirmed the Department of Natural Resources decision on Donlin Gold water rights, following an unsuccessful appeal. On October 2, 2023, Earthjustice appealed the Superior Court decision to the Alaska seekSupreme Court and filed their opening brief in January. In the federal litigation challenging Donlin Gold\u2019s Joint Record of Decision and Permits, including the 404 permit, the U.S. Department of Justice is finalizing compilation of the administrative record for the court. The briefing schedule was agreed in the fourth quarter and will extend through the first half of 2024. Despite these numerous challenges all appeals against the Donlin Gold projects have been unsuccessful to date, thereby reinforcing our confidence in the thoroughness of the permitting process acknowledging the importance of readiness and preparation along with the unwavering support from Donlin Gold and its owners. We remain committed to backing all agencies and defending the permits. With that, I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Ottewell to review the 2023 year-end financial results. Dave?\nDavid Ottewell: Thank you, Greg. Turning to Slide 19. For the year, our net loss decreased by $6.5 million from 2022 primarily due to lower field expenses at Donlin Gold and increased interest income, partially offset by an increase in interest expense on the promissory note and higher G&A expenses. Donlin Gold expenses were lower in 2023 with field work in geotechnical drilling completed in July for the Alaska Dam Safety certification applications and hydrogeologic drilling to support the mine planning and design compared to the large exploration drilling program in 2022. G&A costs increased due to higher corporate travel costs, legal expenses and additional PS units granted to the company\u2019s executive officers as a retention incentive to June 30, 2024. Higher interest rates in 2023 impacted both the interest income on cash and term deposits and interest expense on the promissory note. On Slide 20, cash and term deposits increased in 2023 by $0.2 million, with corporate, administrative and our share of Donlin Gold expenditures, offset by interest income of $5.7 million and the note proceeds received from the Newmont note of $25 million. Compared to the prior year, Donlin Gold\u2019s funding was lower due to the geotechnical and hydrogeologic drilling program compared to the exploration drilling program in 2022. Higher G&A costs resulted from increased travel and legal expenses and the PSU awards that matured in 2023 did not meet the performance criteria, and therefore, no common shares were issued and no withholding taxes were paid in 2023. Our treasury remained strong with cash and term deposits totaling $125.7 million at November 30. And our anticipated expenditures for the 2024 are approximately $31 million, including $14 million for Donlin and $17 million for corporate G&A. Greg, I\u2019ll turn it back to you.\nGreg Lang: Thank you, Dave. [Technical Difficulty]\nThomas Kaplan: Hello, everyone. I want to take this as an opportunity to be able to assure our investors that we are, as investor-friendly as well as transparent as any company in the mining industry. We have, from the very outset since Greg Lang and I became CEO and Chairman, respectively, laid out, not just verbally, but in writing everything that we would be doing for the years coming in terms of making NovaGold a pure-play on what we regard as the greatest gold development story in the world, a Tier 1 asset in a Tier 1 jurisdiction. At the same time, we\u2019ve also been completely straightforward as gold bowls, representing a very, very intelligent shareholder base who share our convictions that we see NovaGold as a pure-play on Donlin as being the best risk-reward story in the gold development space. Now, as you will have heard, we\u2019ve approved the budget with our partners at Barrick. There is a difference in terms of our point of view as to some of the steps forward. But we\u2019re taking the project up the value chain with them and the conversations are ongoing, and we\u2019ll see where they go. But they will not be going into a place that we\u2019re uncomfortable. Let me review the NovaGold thesis, because I think it\u2019s extremely important for you to understand why as someone who\u2019s been in this story for 15 years and Chairman for 12 years, there is no way literally, no way that I, on behalf of the shareholders, will allow any opportunity for our share price to be able to reach $13.5 and higher. We have a unique story. In fact, you\u2019ve heard it before, but let me just reiterate this. When I ask investors, which asset has the combination of size, grade, which means low OpEx as a producer, which has 39 million ounces already identified on 5% of the overall land package. In fact, 30% of what\u2019s on strike and our drill programs have also hit to depth. We know this is going to be much bigger and candidly, so do some of the major mining companies. There should be no doubt in anyone\u2019s mind that if they buy NovaGold at these prices, they are buying it well below the price that anyone would pay for it, which should give them some comfort. And if in order to impress upon people that these are prices, which are the product of special circumstances that will find resolution. All options are on the table, including stock buybacks, promotion of the value of these assets in very, very different ways. This is a pledge that I make to you. I\u2019ve been in it for 15 years, I\u2019m happy to be in it for another 15 years. Everything that happened since I became an investor in this story has only reinforced my view that Donlin [indiscernible] that Donlin is the new Carlin. And when I make references to these things, I\u2019m making reference to great assets in great places. NovaGold as a gold company, with the size, the grade, the exploration potential, being a pure-play on what has the potential to be a million-ounce producer among the lowest cost producers with fantastic Native Corporation Partners with whom we enjoy excellent relations and fidelity and solidarity. And most importantly, in today\u2019s world, we\u2019re in an address where if you go to sleep at night, you know that when you wake up in the morning, you haven\u2019t been eaten literally or figuratively. You know that there are no insurgence. You know that there are no missile strikes. You know that you\u2019re not dealing with kleptocrats where the rule of law is not a novelty, which can be overthrown at will where private property is in shrined, the second largest gold producing state in the United States, where we enjoyed the most wonderful relationship with our Native Corporation Partners who really, really appreciate the stand, which we are taking on this story. To us, our treasury is sacred. We don\u2019t oppose drilling. I\u2019d love to continue drilling to be able to show my belief that we can increase this resource by a huge amount. But for the time being, our view and circumstances could change, but our view is our shareholder treasury, which gives us years of runway is part of our overall profile. And we like it. We haven\u2019t needed to raise outside capital since 2012. That\u2019s extraordinary. That\u2019s because every promise that we ever made in taking us away from being a gold copper company to a pure gold company with the spin-off of NovaCopper, now Trilogy, with the sale of Galore to Newmont, has been affirmed. All of our shareholders know that we have always kept our promises and that we have been transparent to the point of verbosity, especially on my part, obviously, because brevity isn\u2019t my strong suit in order to hold fast with them. Well, I will remind them. The owner lives above the store. That\u2019s a quotation from one of the most powerful fund managers in the world about his take on the way that I view Donlin. It is a passion project and will be pursued as such. You will not be seeing any absence of earnestness in seeing our share price multiply. In fact, if I have any sense of forecasting at all, I would say that one of the greatest trades in the gold industry will prove to be long NovaGold and short some others who don\u2019t share all of our attributes, and I\u2019m not talking about juniors, I\u2019m talking about majors. Well, let\u2019s continue to talk about some of the macros. If we go to Slide 24, we\u2019re setting up for a perfect storm in gold. And for us, it\u2019s very obvious. The way to play it is to be able to give yourself the maximum leverage to the thesis and scrub that thesis find the right asset that will stay with you and allow you to reap the fruits of that leverage. For us, it\u2019s Donlin and nothing has changed in our view to the country [ph]. When we look at things that are going on in Asia, Africa, South America, we know what we have. We have the most beautiful \u2013 we have the most beautiful girl in the world, and she\u2019s with us. I don\u2019t know, I probably just got canceled. But in an event, as far as gold is concerned, I think that what we\u2019re seeing is a slow motion breakout. When gold goes past, and I don\u2019t like to talk about specific prices or even timing. But when you look at this chart, I think that it\u2019s pretty clear that you have beautiful chart formations from a classic cup and saucer to multiple tops. The question is, are the fundamentals there to take gold to what I believe will be a new equilibrium level of between 3,000 and 5,000. And I know that, that sounds like a very wide range, but that\u2019s because I could see gold in certain circumstances, trading to 5%, swinging to 3%, going back to 5%. And the truth is, there\u2019s no reason for me to make higher forecast than that, but gold could go much, much higher than that. This is just on supply-demand fundamentals that I make the forecast that I do. But I believe that in as much as patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel, fear factors of the [indiscernible] for the gold boat. They\u2019re not necessary. The supply pressures. Donlin is twice the average grade of the mines that are being proposed. To the extent that there are any major mines, production costs, we\u2019ve seen rising, the exploration budgets are completely inadequate. The discovery rates are probably at an all-time low. I love drilling. I\u2019m always drilling. And the fact is that I\u2019m in a very, very small minority, which has never faced me. I made 100 times my money on drilling in silver. A 100 times on PGMs. A 100 times on hydrocarbons. I would match our track record with all, but a few other, not just smart, but also very, very lucky people, and we acknowledge luck in the same way as we acknowledge the luck that had NovaGold falling into our laps when we came in and rescued it. Stock went from 3% to 15%. You will see it happen again, if not much, much higher. And I will do everything within my power to make that forecast come true. Now the reality is, if you go to Slide 25, I\u2019m not going to blame our performance on the fact that the gold equities have greatly underperformed gold itself. That\u2019s not uncommon in commodities because you often see that the physical demand increases from certain levels and when you get the investor sentiment, it then flows into the equities that are correlated to those commodities or currencies in the case of gold. The thing that has changed is that when I got into the business 30 years ago, the value of all the precious metal shares in the world were about the value of Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). And now the value of all the precious metal shares in the world is a fraction of many, many, many technology companies. So the question is will technology come down to earth in some sense. And I don\u2019t mean that in terms of will technology stops fall. I mean that in the sense that what is the status of gold in the world. Well, for me, the fact that the central banks have remained huge buyers. As you can see on Slide 26, tells me that gold has legs. Central banks are not stupid money. They may be forced by their governments to do stupid things unless the global economy fall apart and \u2013 but they know what they have on their balance sheets, and they are voting with their feet. With gold, I want to be on their side of the table. The path of least resistance for a Central Bank Bureaucrat, is to go with the trend. So when you have the Chinese and the Indians competing over who\u2019s going to be the largest consumer when you have central banks as buyers, it\u2019s very, very clear that the trend is our friend. At some point, you will see a catalyst that will have a big impact on the equities. And it will be impossible to get into them at levels that you\u2019re seeing now. It will be as one with put it years ago, like getting Hoover Dam through a garden hose, because there are a lot of funds that can really only buy equities. And the solid performance that they will show will attract more and more money. Just the fact that financial assets are amongst the only assets that people want to buy much, much more of as they get dear. The equities market in the gold and platinum and silver space is highly undervalued. And as you\u2019ve heard, our view is that the place to be is in fabulous assets, Tier 1 assets in Tier 1 jurisdictions. You\u2019ve got to have both. In fact, when we see what\u2019s happened in Europe, when we see what\u2019s going on in the Middle East, and Asia, and South America. The reality is the geopolitics Trump\u2019s geology, and I love geologists. But if you\u2019re not in a place where the rule of law is not sacred. My worst fear for those who are is that ironically, they will be right on gold. And by being right on gold, when gold is reviewed as a strategic asset, like we are seeing happen with lithium, those assets will be the object of avaricious local governments for want of a better word. And as you know, I made my bones in Bolivia, Zimbabwe, South Africa. I sold Kibali to Barrick, I\u2019m not squeamish. I was the largest holder of mineral rights in Pakistan focused on Balochistan, a country that I studied 35 years ago when I was doing my doctorate on counter insurgencies, still studying it. I know these places, and I really do believe that for me, as someone who voted with his feet, the best place to be is the United States. Canada, Mexico, so long as it stays part of NAFTA, Australia. That\u2019s where you want to be. I mean there are a few other obs and ends in Europe, et cetera. But do you want to be in places where you can sleep. And the reason for that is if you can sleep well, you can hold on for when the reversal comes. And if past is prologue in my experience, it\u2019s when you least expect it, and the stock doubles, triples and then people start to cottoning on and that\u2019s where you make your 10 bagger. When the fundamentals catch up, with the asset quality and the safety of jurisdiction in the hands of a management team that, in our case, we\u2019re instrumental in building Cortez in Nevada. Richard Williams, brought Pueblo Viejo into production in the Dominican Republic, just in time for them to change the rules, of course. But that\u2019s still not just like mine, but one that\u2019s being expanded by our co-owner in Donlin, Barrick. Our expertise in the Americas truthfully is second to none. They could run a larger gold company. Moving to Slide 27. I think I covered this, but this is a very, very sad chart for the industry. Good for us, sad for the industry. Gold reserves have been falling. It\u2019s possible that we can see reserves that may have been uneconomic now start to come back in, but that implies higher gold prices. So that\u2019s a win-win if that happens. One thing that is not happening is that grade has plunged. If you look at that chart on the right, what you\u2019ll see is Donlin is where the industry was in 2004, 2005, 2006, 20 years, hence, the industry is going towards a gram, if not lower. Some of the best drill results that were developed in the gold space over the last two drill programs, which according to Barrick, derisked the geology, we think it was always derisk, but so what? A happy partner is a good thing. We delivered some of the best drill results in the entire industry. You heard them from us at least, and we\u2019re very, very comfortable with the fact that we have the best asset. Now something else that I want to mention, I\u2019m not going to predict a recession. I\u2019m not an economist. It probably means I have a better chance of predicting a recession. But I know global risks very well. There are a lot of things I don\u2019t know. 99% of things, I don\u2019t know. And candidly, business use is the least interesting of my activities unless it\u2019s related to gold. But I can tell you something. Recession can come from many places. You could have a financial crisis in China. For argument\u2019s sake, you could have 1929 in China, which could have a knock-on effect on the rest of the world in the way that the financial crisis in 1929 in the United States had a knock-on effect all over the world and led to global conflict, let\u2019s put it like this. We already have an unprecedented conflict in Europe. We have unprecedented actions in the Middle East that are beyond Barbaric in terms of what was carried out on October 7 and is a game changer in many ways. I won\u2019t go into that here. But I have given some interviews on that subject over the last couple of months. But one of the things that people must take into account is that there is a chance for recession. And if there is the rush to exits is going to be absolutely unprecedented because the world hasn\u2019t had a real recession in this state of indebtedness. And it may very well come from financial reasons or it could come from a combination of geopolitics and finance. I\u2019m not going to prefer any more specific instances, except in perhaps private conversations. Suffice it to say, you want to have gold in your portfolio. I own it because I love the supply-demand equation. I love the fact that the gold industry is hyper challenged and that, that is for my life span as an investor irreversible. So, I like it for a lot of positive reasons. But my background is as a history in counter insurgency, military history and the world has never been this dangerous since the end of the Second World War. So, when I look to own something, whether it\u2019s gold or at my conviction that gold will lead and other factors will lead to NovaGold multiplying because it\u2019s got everything I want in a place where I want it to be, it comes from the place of massive conviction. And as all of our shareholders know about Greg and myself, the whole management team, we don\u2019t just talk the talk, we walk the walk. Watch this space. It\u2019s going to get really interesting. The most important thing for our investors, as you can see on Slide 29 is we have enormous leverage to gold. And that is something that we have to reiterate. But again, it\u2019s leverage in a place where you can keep the fruits of the leverage. And there are many places that if gold does what I think it\u2019s going to do, they\u2019re not going to let you keep it. We are seeing it with lithium. We\u2019re seeing it in some places with copper. We will see it in gold, not in NAFTA, not worried about that. All of what I\u2019ve expounded is very, very well known to our large shareholders. They\u2019ve heard me say it publicly to all of you. Everyone knows that if they want to speak to me about any subject, they can. And I have no lack for words. But I would also like to take the opportunity to thank our shareholders for being not only stalwart and faithful, their solidarity and no pun intended fidelity is enormously appreciated. I\u2019ve heard people scold their shareholders in the gold space for short-termism. I\u2019ve never encountered that. I mean people trade, and that\u2019s fine. But the most faithful shareholders and co-investors and partners that I\u2019ve ever had, whether they are our sovereign wealth fund partners, whether they are institutional investors and families, the most faithful are the precious metals investors. And I would go into battle for all of these shareholders, indeed any one of these shareholders. And so as I said, watch this space. It\u2019s going to be a very, very interesting opportunity for us to be able to put a spotlight on an asset that is not just in its size, grade, exploration potential, production, profile and jurisdiction, unique, but one that is wildly undervalued. And with that, I thank you. And obviously, we welcome any questions that you may have.\nMelanie Hennessey: Ayisha, can you prompt the group for those that have questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Lucas Pipes with B. Riley Securities. Please go ahead.\nLucas Pipes: Thank you very much operator. Good morning everyone. Tom, you mentioned that there are some differences I couldn\u2019t write down the exact wording you used between you and your joint venture partner. And I wondered if you could maybe elaborate on that and kind of where you see the shared common goals and where there may be some temporary differences at this time? Thank you so much.\nThomas Kaplan: Well, I\u2019ll let Greg speak to the shared common goals, because they are technical aspects that both of us are committed to in taking NovaGold up the value chain, which is their terminology as well as ours. As we put in the press release and as we\u2019ve said, we\u2019ve been making \u2013 we\u2019ve been making representations together as partners for two years to the market and to the Native Corporations that when the drilling is over, we go to feasibility. And that is what we are going to stick with because our strategy, which has been articulated is that we\u2019re not in a rush to go into production until the economics justify it, and that they will surely come and I have no doubt that Donlin, which is a generational mine, will be running for many, many, many decades. I have no doubt about that, and I have a sense that our co-owner feels likewise. What I would say is this, we\u2019ve made what we consider to be commitments. The only constraint is the fact that we have a partner. Our partner wants to continue drilling. The geology according to our partner, has been derisked, satisfied with the ore body. The drilling is in order to mine plan. Our attitude is, we can do that in parallel with the feasibility study. And that\u2019s where we are. It\u2019s really that simple. Our management team, Greg, who was the President of Barrick Gold North America for eight years before joining us, because he felt that Donlin was the best development asset within Barrick. Richard Williams, who, as I mentioned, was a project from the Pueblo Viejo project for Barrick and Goldcorp at the time, now Newmont. When he finished that project, he joined with Greg in NovaGold, because he was asked by an analyst for one of our largest shareholders. Why\u2019d you leave? And he said because \u2013 after having built Pueblo Viejo, I want to now build the greatest gold mine in the world. And that\u2019s a Donlin. And both of them, their attitude is this gives us leverage to the greatest asset in the Barrick portfolio. And candidly, I think it\u2019s the case. And if you look at what Donlin brings to Barrick\u2019s reserve base, either their 50% share or all of it, you can see that they\u2019re not done. They can stick with something to drill, and we don\u2019t have to. Our budget is settled. We\u2019re not in conflict. We know what we want. We believe that what we want is, what has been promised and what is best for everyone, Native Corporations, our shareholders and candidly, Barrick shareholders unless their agenda is different from ours. Our strategy has always been very simple. No wine before its time. We articulated it, we\u2019ve written it. Our strategy is get the feasibility study done, so that when the economics line up, we\u2019re in a position to be able to put together the financing that will enable Donlin to go into production. That\u2019s what we want. Our Native Corporation partners have been unbelievably patient. But this is a game changer for the entire region and the social license that we enjoy is candidly more valuable to us than the metal itself. Equally, our shares are more valuable to us than the metal itself, which is why we will take all measures necessary to improve the share price performance. So it\u2019s an impasse that can just simply be shrugged off for the time being. Both parties can come to terms, they know what we want. We know what they want. If we don\u2019t budge, there\u2019s no drilling. If they don\u2019t budge, there\u2019s no feasibility for the time being. But at the end of the day, like I said, I\u2019ve been in this for 15 years. I suffer from the opposite of deal fatigue I am more excited. And this isn\u2019t bravado. I\u2019m more excited about Donlin, than I\u2019ve ever been. When I see what\u2019s going on in the world. I have no doubt that our mantra in leverage in a place where you can keep the fruits of the leverage is best expressed via gold development stocks and great ones with great assets in safe places. And I have a feeling that people are cottoning on to that in not just one, but major mining companies. We\u2019re clearly undervalued relative to what the share price can do. And as I said, I think long NovaGold and short some others will be the best trade in the gold space. But Greg, could you answer perhaps some of the things for, which I don\u2019t have a natural aptitude.\nGreg Lang: Sure. Well, Lucas for next year, we\u2019ve approved a budget of well over $28 million, which is still a substantial budget for Donlin. And this will advance our resource modeling, mine planning work. We\u2019ve got a pilot plant underway that\u2019s, yes it\u2019s actually a fairly expensive undertaking. We\u2019re doing some regional infrastructure support planning hydrology and just related activities as well as our ongoing defensive permits and our extensive community relations programs. Yes, there\u2019s two areas of the budget that we\u2019re still actively discussing with our partner. One is to finalize the scope of work for the update to the capital and operating cost estimates. And the other has been mentioned, is to debate the merits of a drill program and improving if appropriate. And we\u2019re very mindful about treasury, but I think it\u2019s a 50-50 partnership, and I\u2019m confident that we can work our way through these things. Thank you.\nLucas Pipes: Tom and Greg, thank you very much for the additional color and I wish you the entire team a best of luck. Thank you.\nThomas Kaplan: Thank you, Lucas. Keep the faith. Keep the faith. We\u2019re going to astonish you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Don DeMarco with National Bank Financial. Please go ahead.\nDon DeMarco: Thank you, operator and good morning Thomas and Greg. First question is, Greg, I heard you talk about the size of the mineralization. Its impressive strike of eight kilometers over, which only the resource \u2013 current resource only covers just a little more than three kilometers. To what extent have you tested the balance of that eight kilometer mineralized trend?\nGreg Lang: Well, it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ve got ore-grade intercepts are really all up and down the trend, and we\u2019ll follow up as appropriate. And there\u2019s a slides and we can locate one of the older slides in our \u2013 on our web page for you that shows where the potential is along strike. But I think the potential in the near term is really what we see at depth, primarily in the Lewis deposit. Some of our drilling from two seasons ago and encountered great grades of mineralization, well below the bottom of the known pit. So, I think the best potential is in the near term is expand the existing pits and then move out a long strike in other areas of the client [ph] bond.\nDon DeMarco: Okay. Thank you. And so if you were to drill and increase your resource in Donlin at depth or long strike by a measurable amount, would the incremental ounces simply be added to the end of the mine life? Or could this change the development approach as you see it now?\nGreg Lang: It\u2019s probably a little too soon to answer that question. I mean it could do both. It could increase the \u2013 certainly, it will extend the mine life. And then at some stage, the owners would discuss the merits of building a larger facility. So, I think we\u2019ve just got to get our arms around and quantify the potential and then address the issue that you raised.\nDon DeMarco: Okay. Thank you. And just as a final question then. Do you have a process for reaching consensus or settling any strategic differences of opinion with your partner?\nGreg Lang: We maintain an ongoing dialogue. And we\u2019ve \u2013 a its 50-50 partnership a bit like a marriage. It\u2019s a little give and take, and I think and we\u2019ve always been a successful in the past, and I think we\u2019ll get there at the end of this year.\nDon DeMarco: Okay. That\u2019s great. Well, thanks so much and good luck in 2024. Appreciate it.\nGreg Lang: Thank you.\nMelanie Hennessey: We have two questions from the webcast. Some of them have been answered. Maybe, Greg, if you could speak to the NG trading below the NAV and if that\u2019s a worry on CapEx or future dilution, that would be great.\nGreg Lang: Well, I\u2019ll start with that question and probably lateral it to Tom. I mean we\u2019re all disappointed when the share price underperformed especially for no apparent leasing. But our share price really doesn\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019ve got a strong treasury. We\u2019ve got a pretty solid work plan ahead of us this year. And the share price really is not directly connected to the future capital for Donlin project. Tom, anything you want to add to that?\nThomas Kaplan: Sure. I\u2019m not worried about dilution. We have a strong treasury. You have a management team, which has evidenced with our red lines. That we\u2019re only going to spend capital that we believe is being properly spent, by the way, as to the previous question, I wanted to drill the entire district for 15 years. I do not believe that Barrick had that same sense of interest from the time that you have to remember, they launched a hostile takeover in 2006, a couple of years before we became a shareholder. And Barrick\u2019s intention was put 10 drill rigs on the project. And although this is a forward-looking statement of some sort, I\u2019m sure. So please disregard it. I genuinely believe that there\u2019s 100 million ounces there, a long strike to depth and with other targets. And even my friends at Barrick will acknowledge that I\u2019ve made my 100xs through the drill bit, silver, platinum, those were all exploration, energy, complete grassroots exploration. I surround myself with great geologists. And the geologist who\u2019s made some of my biggest discoveries for our team, he\u2019s 100 million ounces at Donlin. And he\u2019s always been right, when it comes to these things, and he\u2019s a brand name in the geology industry. So, I would love to drill more. I just want to make sure that \u2013 and the Board wants to make sure, we are united on this, so you understand. We\u2019re completely united on you drill when it adds value. The ore body is, the ore body as it exists today is what it is. And we think it\u2019s fantastic. We don\u2019t need to squander our social license, perhaps in combination with moving to feasibility and Barrick talking about the asset the way we do. Sure, we\u2019re open. This isn\u2019t personal. This is strictly business. And as Greg said, using constant contact with Barrick on multiple levels. It\u2019s not hostile, but we have to keep faith with who we are. What credibility do I have when I say I\u2019m going to do everything within my power to preserve the company\u2019s profile, raise its share price, husband its treasury, which gives us years? And by the way, the challenge that we have \u2013 is that it\u2019s not about dilution, it\u2019s not about any of that stuff, the challenge that we have is that we\u2019re so undervalued relative to what the real value is in the market that someone could get the wrong idea and think that they can get hold of us. 50% or 100% ownership, whatever it is of Donlin is accretive to every mining company in the world at this point, accretive on every metric, reserves, grade, production profile. Not to mention that if I\u2019m right, that Hoover Dam through a garden hose metaphor will be in North American assets, firstly, they won\u2019t be in Africa. They won\u2019t be in funky places. I don\u2019t believe so. And I voted with my feet by moving from those places back home where I don\u2019t feel that I\u2019m going to experience that great Woody Allen quote \"I\u2019m not afraid of dying. I just don\u2019t want to be there when it happens.\" I love what we have. And the key to being a successful investor in my view, is being \u2013 having so much conviction that you\u2019re willing to stay in it until the world comes around to it. I think that could very, very well happen in the nearer term than people imagine for a variety of reasons, company-specific as well as in the market. But that and cappuccino, the price of the cappuccino, that\u2019s it. That\u2019s all you need. But what I would say is that we are more apparel of being an unwanted takeover target, I believe it would be foolish, but we would be more of a target of that than of running out of money. Does that answer your question?\nMelanie Hennessey: Thank you, Tom. I appreciate the response to the webcast question. Greg, is the litigation worry from to you. Can you speak to some of the engagement efforts and steps that have been taken with the state and federal agencies?\nGreg Lang: Sure. Within the mining industry for many decades in North America. And litigation wasn\u2019t always this way, but probably for the last 15 years or so litigation is a normal part of the permitting process. We were basically a litigious society. And while we \u2013 we don\u2019t really like it, but we know it\u2019s coming. We prepared for it. We\u2019ve had great counsel on board, and we anticipated this even before we\u2019ve got a record of decision in 2018 and we\u2019ve prevailed. There\u2019s four major pieces of the litigation as it works its way through the courts, we\u2019ve prevailed on every ruling to date. Do I have any fear about that going forward, no I think we will continue to prevail. And I\u2019m sure a lot of people are curious what it costs to defend your permits. And frankly, it\u2019s a pretty significant amount of money in our budget to actively defend the permits that we got through a very disciplined process. So I\u2019m not worried about it. It\u2019s a cost of doing business, and we will prevail.\nMelanie Hennessey: Great. Thank you. That is all the questions we have today. Greg, if you want to say some final remarks.\nGreg Lang: Well, everyone, thank you for joining our call today. We\u2019ve got a pretty active year ahead of us, and we will keep everyone appraised as our work unfolds and any potential additions to the approved budget at Donlin. Thank you for your time.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may disconnect your lines. Thank you for participating, and have a pleasant day.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor. For more information see our T&C."

Welcome to Northrop Grumman's Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2023 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. My name is Josh, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.\nTodd Ernst: Thanks, Josh. Good morning and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Fourth Quarter 2023 Conference Call. This morning, we'll refer to a presentation that is posted to our IR website. Before we get started, matters discussed on today's call, including guidance and outlooks for 2024 and beyond reflect the company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including those noted in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially. Today's call will include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release. And on the call today are Kathy Warden, our Chair, CEO and President; and Dave Keffer, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?\nKathy Warden: Thanks Todd. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Before discussing our 2023 results, I wanted to take a moment to thank our team for their hard work and dedication to our important mission. Our talented workforce which is now over a 100,000 strong continues to deliver some of the most advanced technologies in the world. These capabilities are used by our customer\u2019s everyday to defend freedom and deter aggression around the globe. The geopolitical landscape has grown even more complex driving continued increases in global security spending. Our strategies has positioned us well to compete and win in this growing market which has translated into accelerating topline growth for Northrop Grumman. Revenue increased by over 7% in 2023 [indiscernible] more than a billion above the midpoint of our original 2023 guidance. In addition, our book-to-bill for the year was 1.14 times, that\u2019s in line with our exceptional four year average. As a result of this award strength, we achieved a new record backlog which now exceeds $84 billion and now provides a healthy foundation for our continued growth. The underlying performance of our company is strong. We generated free cash flow at the high end of our guidance range, and we comfortably exceeded our sales and EPS guidance range, absence of B-21 charge. While we're disappointed that our assessment of conditions for the low rate initial production portion of the B-21 program necessitated this charge in the quarter, we are confident in our ability to deliver on the company's forward outlook, which remains unchanged. We're also proud of the performance of the B-21 team, which continues to execute an unparalleled aircraft development program. As we look forward, we will continue to execute our business strategy, which at its core is based on technology differentiation, a laser focus on performance, and value delivery for our customers and shareholders. To support this strategy, we are prioritizing investment in our capacity and capabilities. In 2023, we invested over $2.9 billion in R&D and CapEx, that's 7.5% of sales, to continue driving innovation and capacity to support our customer mission success. We also delivered over $2.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, representing a return of approximately 125% of our 2023 free cash flow. So now I'll highlight a few examples of progress we've made across the portfolio that further bolster my confidence in our future. Shortly after the close of the fourth quarter, we announced our GEM 63XL solid rocket boosters helped to successfully power ULA\u2019s Vulcan launch vehicle on its first mission. Future Vulcan missions will utilize additional GEM 63XLs in support of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Kuiper, and other ULA customers, providing a significant growth opportunity for our propulsion business. And this is an important milestone because it supports our investment to significantly ramp production capacity of GEM 63s in the coming years. Global demand for our weapons system increased in 2023, and we expect this trend to continue. In this market, we're both a supplier and a prime. We're a supplier of propulsion systems, warheads, fuses, and cannons across a highly diversified customer base, and a prime contractor for predominantly air-to-ground missiles, including AARGM, AARGM-ER, and Stand-in Attack Weapon. Weapons systems currently represents approximately 7% of total revenue, and based on the demands we're seeing, we expect this business to grow faster than the company average for the foreseeable future, with a significant portion of this expansion coming from international customers. In our Mission Systems business, demand remains exceptionally strong, with a 2023 book-to-bill above 1.2 times, the highest of all of our segments. As we've seen in recent years, the restricted portfolio of Mission Systems is a meaningful driver of growth as our customers pursue solutions that enable them to operate inside the decision loop of potential adversaries who are also advancing their computing capabilities. We are helping our customers stay ahead by developing advanced microelectronics, sensors, processors, and secure communication. Our product lines are enabling faster cycles of modernization, positioning our customers with decision advantage in this rapidly advancing technology environment. And we continue to make significant progress on the EMD phase of Sentinel, which is the next generation land-based leg of the strategic triad. We are achieving milestones to mature the design and reduce risk, including key test activities, such as the successful static fire test of the Sentinel Stage 2 solid rocket motor for the missile earlier this month. Last week, the Air Force submitted to Congress a new set of cost estimates for the program, which triggered a Nunn-McCurdy Breach. This in turn launches a review of the program by the Department of Defense, which we expect to be ongoing for the next several months. It's important to note that the cost growth is primarily driven by estimates for the command and launch facility build-out, which is part of the military construction and procurement phases of the program. We and our industry team are continuing to perform on the EMD phase in close partnership with the U.S. Air Force. And we'll work with the government to explore opportunities to reduce costs on the program with a focus on the late 2020s and beyond when the program is expected to move into the procurement phase. And in the fourth quarter, the B-21 entered its flight test phase. This is a major milestone for the program and achieving it within the baseline schedule is a credit to the Northrop Grumman team and our close partnership with the U.S. Air Force over the past several years. Following this milestone, we were awarded the first LRIP lot in the fourth quarter and production is now underway. Let me take a few moments to provide a little more detail on the B-21 charge. The possibility of which we started talking with you about at this time last year. As you know, like all of industry, we and our suppliers have experienced cost pressure from recent global macroeconomic conditions, which are significantly different from the assumptions the team made when bidding these five production lots in 2015. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we again reviewed our estimated profitability on the LRIP phase of the program. And we now believe it is probable each of the first five LRIP lots will be performed at a loss. The charge is largely driven by a change in our assumptions regarding funding to mitigate the impact of macroeconomic disruptions on the LRIP phase of the program and higher projected manufacturing costs that reflect recent supplier negotiations and our experience in completing the first aircraft. The after tax cash impact related to these updates will be spread over a number of years. Importantly, we have absorbed this effect and we have not changed our outlook for free cash flow growth over the next several years. This is a game changing capability that will be of great value to our nation. And we are focused on executing the program in a way that also delivers value to our shareholders over the coming decades. Turning now to the budget environment. Global national security spending is increasing as the U.S. and allies invest in capabilities to deter and defend against aggression. Demand for our capabilities remain strong due to our differentiated portfolio and alignment to customer priorities including the triad, space and weapons. In the U.S., our franchise programs remain well supported by Congress and the Department of Defense. And this gives us confidence in our outlook even in a constrained U.S. budget environment. We are pleased to have an NDAA in place that provides continued support for defense spending. And we're hopeful that Congress will enact appropriations soon. Our guidance assumes we will not have a shutdown or a full year CR, and we're encouraged by the progress we've seen so far towards passing appropriations in the March timeframe. Additionally, we are monitoring progress on supplemental funding and we see opportunities in expanding the industrial base and increasing munitions production in this pending request. Our allies are also increasing their defense spending and we expect our alignment with their needs for aircraft, weapon systems and mission systems to be an additional source of growth. So as we look to the future, we have the right portfolio and team to deliver on our long-term outlook. Our organic sales have grown at a greater than 5% annual rate since 2019. And our guidance calls for continued growth of 4% to 5% in 2024. Segment operating margin dollars are expected to grow at roughly the same rate as sales in 2024. And our 2024 EPS guidance range of $24.45 to $24.85 at the midpoint represents roughly 6% growth excluding the B-21 charge and 11% growth compared to our initial EPS estimates which we provided for in 2023. In addition, the structural building blocks to expand our margins that we outlined in last year's 2Q earnings call, including dissipating macroeconomic headwinds, implementation of productivity and cost savings initiatives and future favorable mix shift remain in place. We are laser focused on performance and bid discipline to drive margin expansion. And importantly, we continue to expect our free cash flow to grow at a double digit rate over the coming years. We are reaffirming our 2024 and 2025 free cash flow outlook. And we've also introduced a 2026 outlook of $3.3 billion at the midpoint. With the businesses generating significant cash flow, we have considerable flexibility in deploying capital to generate value for customers and shareholders. Our top priority remains investing to support our business strategy. And we expect to invest over 7% of sales again in 2024 in capital expenditures and R&D. At the same time, we'll continue to provide strong capital returns to our shareholders. Last month, our board of directors increased our share repurchase authorization by an additional $2.5 billion, and we ended the year with a remaining authorization of $3.6 billion. For 2024, we expect to increase our share repurchases to at least $2 billion. This includes a $1 billion ASR that we plan to initiate in the coming days based on the strong liquidity position with which we entered this year. So when we take these factors, sustainable top-line growth with expanding margins, and couple those with declining capital intensity and lower projected cash taxes, you get a recipe for robust cash flow growth for years to come. So now I'll turn it over to Dave to provide you more details on the segment results, 2024 guidance, and the forward outlook. Dave?\nDave Keffer: Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. We finished the year with strong momentum, enabling us to reaffirm and build upon our favorable forward outlook. I'll start by elaborating on our 2023 results and then provide additional details on our guidance. On the demand side, we ended 2023 with over $84 billion in backlog, a new record for our company. All four of our segments generated a full-year book-to-bill ratio over one-time sales. We also continued to deliver strong top-line results with Q4 sales of $10.6 billion, up 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Full-year sales were even stronger, up over 7% at $39.3 billion, or roughly $300 million higher than our latest guidance. These top-line results were enabled not only by the strong demand environment we're seeing among our customers, but also by our ability to ramp on new programs, expand our workforce, and convert our backlog into sales. Moving to segment results, we generated sales growth in each of our businesses in 2023. Aeronautics sales were up 2% for the year, returning to growth earlier than previously expected. AS growth was driven by higher volume on restricted programs that more than offset declines on mature production programs. DS posted sales growth of 5%, led by higher volume in the weapons and missile defense portfolio. Mission System sales were also up 5%, driven by higher restricted sales on advanced microelectronics programs and higher volume on marine systems programs. And our space business posted another quarter of double-digit top-line growth, with sales up approximately 14% for the year. Nearly 40% of the growth came from Sentinel and NGI, with the rest coming from our broad space portfolio. As Kathy described, our segment margins included a charge for the B-21 program. The charge was primarily driven by the confluence of lower assumptions around macroeconomic disruption funding and higher production cost projections. While the full pre-tax charge had the effect of lowering our segment margins, only $143 million has been recorded as an EAC adjustment, including a $43 million reduction to Q4 sales. The remaining was booked as a contingent liability because the majority of the lots have yet to be awarded. The charge also led to an $82 million benefit in corporate unallocated expense, stemming from a reduction in deferred state taxes. Continuing with our results, slide 5 shows a comparison of our 2023 earnings per share to the guidance we provided in October. Diluted EPS includes a $2.08 unfavorable mark-to-market adjustment from our pension plans and a $7.68 per share impact from the B-21 charge. Absent these items, we would have exceeded the high end of our prior EPS guidance range by over $0.40. Our 2023 mark-to-market adjusted EPS also included significantly less pension income compared to 2022. In total, net pension costs generated a $4.07 per share headwind in 2023. Next, I'll take a few moments to discuss our cash flows. As is our historical pattern, we had an outstanding quarter of cash performance in Q4, generating $1.6 billion in free cash flow. For the full year, our operating cash flow was $3.9 billion, and our free cash flow was $2.1 billion. This result was near the high end of our guidance range and represented free cash flow growth of 30% compared to 2022. Turning to pension results, we generated strong asset returns of roughly 11% in 2023, ahead of our long-term assumptions. The FAS discount rate declined by roughly 40 basis points to 5.15%. Netted together, along with updated census data, this generated a mark-to-market pension expense of $422 million in our GAAP results. Slide 7 in our earnings deck summarizes our pension estimates for the next three years. We continue to expect CAS recoveries to increase from current levels, providing a benefit to our cash flows, but slightly less than prior projections. And we expect a higher level of non-operating FAS pension income in the coming years, driven by our strong asset returns in 2023. In total, our funded status remains superb at nearly 100%, and we continue to project minimal cash pension contributions over the next several years. Turning to 2024, slide 9 in our earnings deck includes our segment-level guidance. Building off the strong top-line results in Q4, we now expect aeronautics sales in the low 11 billions, driven by growth on B-21 and on other programs such as F-35 and E-2D. This is higher than our prior sales estimates for AS, which reflected a flat 2023 and modest growth in 2024. Higher B-21 sales also result in a slightly lower margin rate expectation for AS, which we now project in the mid-9%, netting out to a similar volume of margin dollars compared to prior estimates. DS sales are expected to be roughly $6 billion, up low single digits from 2023. As we mentioned on the Q3 call, DS has really turned the corner on growth through strong demand for weapons and missile defense capabilities. We are optimistic in our ability to convert these opportunities into sustained growth in this business over time, which we expect to be partially offset by modest declines in the sustainment and training portions of the business. Margins are projected to remain strong at DS in the low 12% range. Mission System sales are expected in the low to mid $11 billion range for another year of mid-single digit growth, with margins of roughly 15%. And that space, after expanding sales at a greater than 17% CAGR since 2019, growth is expected to moderate in 2024 with higher segment margins. Space sales are now expected in the mid-to-high $14 billion range, with margins of approximately 9%. The mid-single digit growth rate in space reflects declines in a restricted program due to shifts in government priority, which are more than offset by growth in other parts of the space portfolio. Having built a tremendous backlog in recent years, space now has an opportunity to deliver strong ROI through more measured growth, along with margin expansion and cash generation. At the company level, our guidance reflects growth in sales and segment margin between 4% 5%, absent the B-21 charge, consistent with the outlook we provided on our October call, even after delivering top line upside in Q4. We expect another solid year of bookings, with a book-to-bill around one times. And similar to our cadence over the last few years, we expect sales to ramp throughout the year, with first quarter sales a little less than 24% of our full year estimate. We plan to be in the market soon for new debt issuance to take advantage of the favorable rate environment. The proceeds from the debt issuance will also be used in part to support refinancings of $1.5 billion of notes that are coming due in January of 2025, as well as for general corporate purposes and share repurchases, including the $1 billion ASR we intend to initiate in the coming days. We've reflected this debt issuance in our interest expense guidance, and we'd also expect interest income to contribute to the EPS line, as it did in 2023. We project an effective tax rate of approximately 17% in 2024, consistent with the range we've experienced over the last few years, excluding the mark-to-market adjustment and other unique items. We're coming closer to conclusions on a number of open audit and appeals processes with the IRS, which could have positive or negative effects on book and cash taxes as they're resolved over the next couple of years, and our forward guidance does not include any such adjustments. Similarly, we have not factored any potential changes to R&D tax legislation into our outlook. And as a reminder, our interpretation of current tax law results in a projected 5-year impact from R&D amortization of approximately $2 billion. We will continue to track these matters carefully and provide updates as they progress. In total, we expect our 2024 earnings per share to be between $24.45 and $24.85 on with approximately 148.5 million weighted shares outstanding. Moving to cash, we expect 2024 free cash flow between $2.25 billion and $2.65 billion consistent with our prior outlook. And as we've said before, capital expenditures are expected to remain elevated in 2024 before moderating in 2025 and beyond. Slide 11 in our earnings deck provides an update to our long-term free cash flow outlook to include 2026. We continue to expect our free cash flow to grow at a double-digit rate for several more years with additional growth in the second half of the decade. This expansion will be driven by sustained growth in our business, generating strong operating margin volume and converting those profits into cash. Meanwhile, lower cash taxes, higher CAS recoveries and lower levels of capital spending in the coming years provide additional structural levers to expand our cash flows at a rapid rate. Importantly, these ranges also include the latest estimated cash impacts associated with the B-21 charge. We expect roughly 60% of the charge to affect cash flows through 2026 with the remainder in the following years. Longer-term, we are confident we'll be able to continue to absorb the cash headwinds from B-21 while delivering excellent free cash flows in 2027 and beyond. In closing, I want to thank the entire Northrop Grumman team for their contributions to another great year. The strength of our portfolio and visibility of franchise programs provides us the opportunity to deliver and deploy robust cash flows as we execute on our strategy. And with that, let's open up the call to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you.[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\nKristine Liwag: Hey good morning, Kathy and Dave.\nKathy Warden: Good morning.\nKristine Liwag: Kathy, on the B-21, you've been very clear about the pressures on this program. Ultimately, how much relief did the customer extend to you to offset macro pressures and elevate [ph] portion. And is there still a possibility of future relief?\nKathy Warden: So Kristine, we've been working with the customer. And as we noted, the conversations continue. And last year, in 2023, we and Air Force disclosed that about $60 million of $1.5 billion that Congress appropriated for inflation was allocated to the advanced procurement for Lot 1 on this program. But we have yet to work through what that relief may be in future lots. We have, of course, as we said, updated our assumptions -- and through conversation and the tight budget environment, we've actually lowered the expectations for inflation relief. And so at this point, our focus is on executing this program and finding opportunities in the performance on the program while we continue to work with the government to see if there is any inflation relief opportunity.\nKristine Liwag: Great, thank you. And I\u2019ll keep it to one today. Thank you.\nKathy Warden: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Richard  Safran  (EPA:SAF) with Seaport Global. You may proceed.\nRichard Safran: Kathy, Dave good morning. So I know you're going to get a lot of questions on the B-21, but I thought I'd ask you about to expand on your opening remarks about Sentinel. I thought you might talk a bit more about the actions you're taking at the program back on track. How are you seeing risk on the program right now? And I guess, importantly, what you think the government's level support for the program is given all the headlines and what we've been seeing?\nKathy Warden: Yes. Thanks, Rich. So as the land-based leg of the nuclear triad, Sentinel is a top priority for the Department of Defense. The requirement for the program has been validated numerous times by multiple administrations, and we expect that to be the outcome of this latest review. As the Air Force is reported, the non-operating cost reach on the program is largely due to cost growth in the military construction and procurement segments of the program, and we and the industry team are currently executing on the cost plus EMD phase of the program. That's important because our design work in this phase is helping the Air Force to better estimate the costs of those later phases and due to a number of factors of learning their cost estimates for these later phases have increased, and that's what's driving the non-[indiscernible] breach as the Air Force has said, growth on the EMD would not have triggered the breach. I'll also note that their update captures the inflation since 2020, the last time they did a cost estimate. And we all know that there's been significantly higher inflation than what was assumed at that time. So some of that is what you're also seeing reflected in these latest cost estimates. I mean with that said, though, you asked about our performance on the program, and I'm really pleased to report on the progress that our team has made over the last 3 years while we've been executing on the EMD phase. We've on boarded thousands of engineers. We've matured the system design. We've produced and tested critical hardware in the missile system, as I've outlined earlier on the call. We've also engaged in risk reduction, which is helping to inform the Air Force launch facility modernization and we've done all this while also doing detailed planning for the future phase of the program. I myself have visited the missile fields actually, I was at one last Friday, which is part of why I've got this cold, I brought back. And I met with the Airmen [ph], who have committed themselves to this important mission. So we're all in. We know how important this is our team is partnering closely with the Air Force, and we're going to help them to deliver this essential capability for our nation.\nRichard Safran: Thanks for that. Feel better.\nKathy Warden: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. You may proceed.\nRonald Epstein: Hey good morning everyone. So maybe just jumping back to B-21. Charges like there's some programs have a tendency to accumulate over time. They don't tend to go the other way. How should we think about it as we go forward? I mean, this is what for the first 5 LRIPs, how many LRIPs could there be? And how do we think about the bounds on this? And then maybe one last thing. Is the program NPV positive and if it is, when does it actually become NPV positive, cash flow positive and so on and so forth. If you could just peel back the onion on the program.\nDavid Keffer: Sure. I can go ahead and get started with that. And see if we can address a number of questions you raised. First of all, in terms of the future, we'll continue to update our projections every quarter as we do with all of our large programs. But it's important to note, we have a lot more information today than we did at this time last year, having completed the production in the ground test phase of the first aircraft. We also have the majority of the suppliers now under contract with the remaining in advanced stages of negotiations. We have our latest estimates for productivity and reasonable learning curves that we believe are appropriate based on our historical experience. Of course, we now have one lot under contract, and we'll finalize quantities of the next four lots over time as well. In the economy and inflationary factors have stabilized a bit over the past year, and we'll continue to track those, of course, over time as well. But perhaps most importantly, we're still performing well on this program, which is continuing to provide a critical capability for our customers. In terms of the long-term NPV, we think that's the most important thing is that our customers will get great value from the aircraft. We'll deliver them over time, and that should, over time, also lead to value for the company and our shareholders.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Douglas Harned with Bernstein. You may proceed.\nDouglas Harned: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to go back to the Sentinel program. And when -- what you've described is that I think because that EMD is going well. But when you look at where this is headed and what came out with the Air Force commentary on the Nunn-McCurdy breach. A couple of things that I wanted to understand better. They're talking about potentially a 2-year delay in IOC, they're also -- also you talked about it a little bit, but to understand how much of this breach is due to potential changes in requirements and things that are, in a sense, under your purview versus those that may be under others, including the government customer?\nKathy Warden: Yes. So as you note, there is a delay to IOC, the reason though for the Nunn-McCurdy breach is the cost growth. So oftentimes scheduled delays add costs to the program, that is not the primary contributor. It is, as you noted, design decisions, particularly related to the command and launch requirements that the Air Force has and that affects the deployment in the launch facilities in each of the silos. And so that is what we are working to inform the Air Force decision process on alternatives and ways to reduce those costs and procurement and yet those are Air Force cost estimates, and they include a significant amount of scope that is outside of the industry team's execution. But nonetheless, we will help to inform those discussions if they're ongoing during this review process.\nDouglas Harned: And does the delay in the timing, does this have much effect right now on your outlook for the overall profitability of the program.\nKathy Warden: It does not, Doug, our near-term assumptions on both the ramp of the program relative to sales as well as the profitability of the program are not materially impacted.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. You may proceed.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning everyone. Thank you. Kathy or Dave, maybe if you could just talk about the free cash flow guidance that you're sticking with the 15% CAGR. Just the drivers in terms of top line working capital, Section 174, and the impact of B-21, Dave, I think you said 60% of that over $600 million is through 2026. Is that right? And do we think about Sentinel as a positive cash contributor?\nDavid Keffer: Sure. Thanks for the question, Sheila. I'm happy to dig into that. The strength of the free cash flow outlook we really think of as one of the highlights our report today. And so happy to dig into that in more detail. And I think you heard correctly that 60% of the charge is associated with the period through 2026 from a cash flow perspective. I think importantly, the strength of the broad base of other programs across the business is serving to offset those pressures. And that's what we're seeing in our ability to maintain and build confidence in our multiyear outlook including adding a strong 2026 year to that outlook that continues the double-digit growth trajectory that we expect for the next several years. We had a great finish to 2023 for free cash flow, really strong working capital performance, and that is enabling us to build confidence in our ability to continue to perform at similar levels going forward. As a company, we've put a lot of focus on working capital efficiency, on capital efficiency, on driving cash returns on recent investments and that is clearly showing up in the results and the performance of all of our sectors. We're proud of their performance on cash in Q4 and in the outlooks for 2024 and beyond. And the net effect of all of these factors is that unchanged free cash flow outlook for 2024 and 2025, along with a strong 2026. I'd highlight in terms of what drives that going forward? What's the underlying force as you point out? Certainly, the operations of the business growth in the top line is, first and foremost, with an opportunity for growth at the margin rate line as well that leads to really strong margin dollar volume, which will convert into cash through the strong working capital performance that we expect to continue which is essentially a stable assumption in our outlook. We're not looking for significant additional efficiencies given just how strong we were at the end of 2023. And then as we noted earlier, there are other structural factors that should help as well with CAS pension reimbursement growing slightly over the next few years and cash tax is projected to decline over that same period. So essentially, all of those factors will lead to strong -- strong free cash flow growth outlook for the next several years and beyond.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\nSeth Seifman: Thanks very much. And good morning. I guess a 2-part question about B-21. First was the $143 million EAC in the quarter, is that the extent of the entire anticipated loss on lot 1 and I guess, how do we think about the progression of losses on the various lots? And then second, the fact that this charge includes lots that will be in budgets in 2026 and 2027 and not come under contract for a while and not be worked on for a while. I guess how would you assess the opportunity to maybe ultimately do a little bit better than anticipated here.\nDavid Keffer: Sure. I can start on that, Seth. I think you've read properly into the $143 million EAC adjustment with Lot 1 having been awarded and the other is not yet awarded, that one does take the form of an EAC adjustment. So that $143 million is the lot 1 amount we are currently projecting. And the future progression while we can't get into much detail because that would involve a lot sizes and quantities and other classified details. Clearly, the implication is that there's modest growth from lot 1 to future lots on average. Over time, I think you're thinking of this the right way that our current projections would indicate an average of a couple of hundred million dollars a year of after-tax impact on our -- on the cash line from B-21, and that's, as I referred to a few minutes ago, the headwind we've been able to mitigate through strength in the rest of the business. In terms of your point about opportunity to outperform that over the long-term. Clearly, it is a core focus of our team to continue to drive efficiencies in the learning curves, successful outcomes of our negotiations with suppliers. We continue to engage and partner with our customer to understand macroeconomic impacts on the program and address opportunities for funding of relief, as Kathy mentioned earlier. And so we'll continue to address all of those opportunities. This is something we'll update you in the rest of the Street on over time.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with TD Cowen. You may proceed.\nCai Von Rumohr: Thanks so much. Kathy best wishes to feel better.\nKathy Warden: It sounds like you need those wishes as well.\nCai Von Rumohr: So anyway, so you had the loss on the B-21 kind of it didn't look like a loss couple of quarters ago. You've had your second loss on Halo. This is clearly proving to be an environment where on fixed price contract, there is more risk. Have you changed your strategy regarding how you bid and specifically with reference to Tranche 2 of the tracking satellites because you were on Tranche 1 and you were not on Tranche 2. So have you changed your strategy in terms of how you're bidding? And are there any contracts that you bid before changing your strategy that would still have risk that we're not aware of today?\nKathy Warden: Very insightful question as always, Cai. So when you look back to 2015, when we did B-21, we certainly have changed our view on bidding of contracts where did not have a mature design. It's a point of bid and yet we committed to fixed price options into the future. And we have, to my knowledge, not done that again. And we have passed on some high-profile programs as a result of the risk balance that the customer put forward in the RFP not meeting our standards. We have programs like Halo, which we have certainly learned some additional lessons and are applying those as we move forward. And you note on some very recent bids, we have taken a different approach in looking at firm fixed price, where we've either declined a bit if the customer chose to go fixed price or we've offered a price -- in the case of SDA Tranche 2 that we thought was fair and reasonable and the customer decided not to further negotiate with us. These are things that are going to happen and we're going to remain disciplined. We have plenty of opportunity in this company to grow. We have a strong pipeline of opportunities we're pursuing. And a strong pipeline of opportunities that we believe have the right risk/reward balance with industry.\nCai Von Rumohr: Thanks so much. Feel better.\nKathy Warden: Thank you too.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Gavin Parsons (NYSE:PSN) with UBS. You may proceed.\nGavin Parsons: Thanks, good morning.\nKathy Warden: Good morning.\nGavin Parsons: Maybe just following on Ron's question. Does the B-21 charge contemplate current conditions as they are? Does it have some consideration for future uncertainty in macro or supply chain?\nKathy Warden: With all of our EACs, B-21 included, we do our best based on what we know today to project conditions out into the future. Now with that said, that's difficult to do longer-term that period of performance is. So in this case, we're looking out over greater than 5 years. So as we get into those out years, that's a bit more speculative, but we do incorporate our expectations for changes in everything from material labor pricing to productivity and learning.\nGavin Parsons: Okay. Understood. And Dave, you mentioned the IRS appeal process. Any way to put a range around the possible cash impact on that?\nDavid Keffer: No, I'd refer you to our tax disclosures for more than enough detail on all of those fronts. It's tough to put a range around those things. We're looking forward to getting through processes, as you know, from those disclosures, we have a lot of open years that have yet to be resolved and looking forward to working with the IRS to come to reasonable resolutions there, and we'll update you on any book or tax differences from current reserves as we get there.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.\nScott Deuschle: Hey good morning.\nKathy Warden: Good morning.\nScott Deuschle: Dave, can you give us a sense for the proportion of supplier costs across the 5 LRIP lots that have now been fixed versus what's still open to negotiation?\nDavid Keffer: Sure. As we noted a few moments ago, we're now at a majority of the supplier costs that have been fully negotiated across the LRIP phase. And we're in various stages of negotiation with suppliers for the remainder. So that's one area where we have learn more and progressed in our process compared to where we were a year ago or even a quarter ago.\nScott Deuschle: Okay. Great. And then just as a follow-up, where does the commercial inventory come from in the space business? And is that EBIT headwind mostly gone now? Or is there any more of that left to come in 2024? Thank you.\nDavid Keffer: Sure. Thanks for the question. We had offsetting effects in 2024 and 2023, rather, including Q4 in the commercial elements of the space business. As you know, those are much smaller than and kind of tangential to the core national security space business that we have. In the case of those commercial inventory write-downs, those were related to newer investments in product lines to address burgeoning market opportunity in both the government and commercial elements of the space market. We did see some modest write-downs in various quarters in 2023 associated with those. Those are the types of things you occasionally go through as you make such new investments. So again, not core to the current or future growth story of the space business.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.\nKenneth Herbert: Yes, thank you good morning. Maybe, Kathy, at a high level, I wanted to follow up on your comments earlier regarding sort of the key margin drivers you outlined last year. Specifically more on the cost and productivity efforts and maybe on the mix side, are you seeing incrementally more opportunity now as we think about 2024? And how should we think about sort of the absolute opportunity on those now into this year versus perhaps how much more of a benefit we see in 2025 and beyond.\nKathy Warden: Thanks, Ken. We laid out 3 drivers, the first of which being stabilization in macroeconomics, and we are certainly seeing that in 2024, which is why we see our margin rates this year in line with last with some opportunity for improvement as we go throughout the year. We layer on top of that cost and productivity actions that we are taking in the company, and that will provide some tailwinds in 2024 growing tailwinds into 2025. And the mix shift really is a bit of a longer-term proposition for us. We've talked about that being a shift from cost type to fixed price, where we expect 2023 was really our high watermark for cost type, but a very gradual shift in that mix to fixed price with more of it coming in the latter half of this decade. And then international mix is the other where we don't expect significant international growth in 2024, but we do expect that to step up based on our pipeline and particularly the strong weapons demand outside the U.S. in 2025. That gives you a sense of what will be a tailwind to margin rate win.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.\nMyles Walton: Thanks, good morning. I was wondering, Dave, or Kathy, you previously talked about a $4 billion free cash flow target in 2028, effectively doubling what you've done in 2023. I just want to make sure that's still on the table, despite the charge absorption in that period of time? And then maybe, Kathy, on the margin expansion specific to Aerospace, is that still a 10% margin business? Or do we have to glide slope down a little bit further into 2025, 2026.\nDavid Keffer: Thanks for the question, Myles. Let me kick off with the 2023 free cash flow number. I appreciate the question on that because I think that too is core to the outlook going forward. Yes, we are reaffirming that $4 billion target for 2028. And essentially doubling the level that we were projecting at the midpoint of our 2023 guidance, which was $2 billion. Of course, we exceeded that by $100 million in our final result for 2023. The drivers of that growth are much of what we've talked about already. Certainly, growth in the top line. As Kathy just noted, some of the drivers of margin rate expansion opportunity which leads to margin dollars having an opportunity to exceed the growth rate of our top line through 2028. And importantly, CapEx will moderate during that same period. So we've noted that 2023 and 2024 of these peak years of capital intensity that continues to be our outlook with declines in 2025 and beyond. And then pension and tax will serve as tailwinds during that same period. So that leads you to the $4 billion number. And I think if you look at the 2024 and 2025 numbers we've reiterated for our free cash outlook today and add in that 2026 range, you'll get to that same glide slope that would push you upward toward the $4 billion number by 2028. So those are the building blocks and the way we plan to get there.\nKathy Warden: And Myles, on AS margins, what we're seeing, as Dave noted earlier is that with the B-21 growth being a bit stronger than we had anticipated, AS is stepping up on top line. It is putting some pressure on margin rate, but margin dollars are exactly where we had anticipated they would be coming into 2024, and our guide therefore, remained consistent for AS on a dollar basis, even though we now are looking at more of a mid-9s rate projection. As you go out over time, it's less dependent on what happens with absorbing that lower rate on B-21 and more what happens in terms of other new programs coming into the AS portfolio and the rate at which we will book those programs. So we'll provide you more insight into that over the coming year as we look towards 2025 and beyond.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. You may proceed.\nRobert Spingarn: Hey good morning. Kathy, a few minutes ago, you alluded to international and I wanted to bring up IBCS because it's had some strong demand signals from international customers and thought maybe you could dig into that program a little bit, give us a sense of how large it is in revenue or how -- in 2023 or 2024? And how big it might be, let's say, 5 years from now?\nKathy Warden: It certainly is an area of strength in our portfolio. We've seen strong performance by the team on the U.S. Army program and also as we are deploying in Poland, and we see follow-on opportunities in Poland as a result. We've also, as I\u2019ve spoken about throughout the course of 2023, added a number of additional countries who have expressed interest in the program to the pipeline, and that's what would drive the growth that we anticipate in the 2025 time frame. As you noted, I mentioned international demand. Part of that is weapons part of that is the IBCS portfolio. And then, of course, we have some aircraft and mission system strength in the pipeline for international in 2025 as well. The program itself is growing at a fairly rapid rate, but off of a relatively small it's about $400 million of annual sales. And we expect that to grow, of course, but not a major contributor is the enterprise line for growth.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. You may proceed.\nGeorge Shapiro: Good morning. Kathy, I wanted to ask on the charge for the B-21, what caused it to be bigger than the 0 to $1.2 billion range that you've kind of been reiterating since last year? And then just specifically, maybe the margin that you had said would be around 10% is now maybe 9.5%. I know you alluded to a few minutes ago, the B-21 was growing faster. But it\u2019s got to grow a lot faster to drop the margin by 50 basis points. So I was just wondering if you could explore that a little bit more. Thanks very much.\nKathy Warden: Let me start with the first part of your question and Dave will cover the second. As we noted, we identified this risk last year, and we, throughout the year, revisited it on a quarterly basis. There were 2 primary changes in the fourth quarter that both led us to deem it probable loss as well as impacted the value of that loss. First, we significantly reduced our projections for funding related to macroeconomic impacts, as we've talked about a couple of times already. Although we continue to partner with the government to address these impacts. We believe it's prudent in light of the current budget status to reduce those assumptions. And so we did that. The second is we've experienced growth in our cost projection, both in the internal production costs as we've continued to build aircraft as Dave talked about through our negotiations with suppliers. We have learned and built that learning into the forward-looking estimates that we now have in the EAC, so those were the factors. As we've talked about, we did a very detailed look at this EAC in the fourth quarter and had matured and had actual data to reflect on that we did not have at an earlier point.\nDavid Keffer: Let me follow up on the second part of your question because I do think it's an important nuance. The AS business was operating in the mid-10 billions in scale over the past year, it exceeded our original expectations in sales in 2023 and now is projected to exceed them even more significantly compared to where they were a year ago in 2024. We were talking about a flat 2023 and very modest growth in 2024 based off of that mid-tens level. And now we're all the way up into the low 11s. And so that low 11s at a mid-9% margin rate is the same as the mid-to-high 10s at a slightly higher margin rate. We're really focused on driving the dollar volume of operating margin in our Aeronautics business and across our business, it's that return on invested capital, the growth in margin dollars and in free cash flow that results from it, that is really our core focus.\nTodd Ernst: Josh, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our final question. Our final question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi. You may proceed.\nJason Gursky: Hey good morning everybody. Dave, just a clarification question for you to start. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that there were some shifting priorities from the government and the space business that was leading to a deceleration in growth. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on what those shifting priorities might be? And then Kathy, I just wanted to provide you maybe a bit of an open-ended question to kind of wrap all this together here. Just broadly talk about all the risks and opportunities that you see in front of you on the execution side of things. You've obviously got record backlog here and we know about the B-21 risk. But I'm wondering if you could just maybe highlight and wrap this all together, do we have a balanced risk and opportunities portfolio here, we a little bit more overweight risk than we are opportunity? And maybe just kind of dive into a little bit of the details of what you're seeing and maybe what you're all doing to address those issues. Thanks.\nDavid Keffer: Sure. Great questions, Jason. Let me go ahead and start with your original question on the national security space portfolio. As we mentioned, our guidance captures growth and declines in various programs across all of our portfolios, very much including space. In the case of space, as we've noted, there are some shifts in budget priorities. A lot of our customers are having to address budget prioritization, particularly as it relates to 2025 and beyond. With that said, in this particular case, given that it's in the restricted domain, there's not much more we can say about the mission or the program or anything like that. What's important there is that our space sector, and therefore, company guidance accounts for our latest understanding of all the programs in that portfolio and the likely path forward for them. And I think when you look at the space guidance, you see a lot of value creation as they continue to grow the top line. And in this case, now grow margin rates alongside that with lower capital intensity starting in 2025, in particular, you see a lot of improvement in returns on invested capital in the space business, given how much growth they've built in their foundation over the last few years.\nJason Gursky: Kathy?\nKathy Warden: And Jason, I really appreciate the question. I wish I had another hour to discuss it with you, but being respectful of everybody's time, let me just simply say that I see our portfolio and the set of opportunities and risks we have as balanced and consistent with what I have seen in recent years since I stepped into this role. We have a team who has stepped up and provided top line growth, which I believe is industry leading at about 5% on a compound annual basis each of the last four years. We're projecting that again this year. We see the opportunity space is rich, both domestically and internationally. And to the risks that we have in executing this portfolio, while the pandemic certainly made that more challenging for the last couple of years. We're turning the corner. Our overall program performance has not been stronger since I've been at the company, and that's 15 years and going. So I really feel good about how this team is positioned. We now have fully disclosed and taken into the P&L the B-21 risk, which we've been talking about and feel confident that we can now go execute this program. And I am proud of what the team collectively has accomplished across 2023 and look forward to the outlook we have in place for 2024. So with that, I just want to again thank my colleagues at Northrop Grumman for their dedication, both to our country and our company. I also want to thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in April. So Josh, that concludes the call. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

        "article_content": " \n\nNetScout Systems, Inc. (NTCT) reported a 19% year-over-year decline in third-quarter fiscal year 2024 revenue, totaling approximately $218 million. The company's cybersecurity segment experienced double-digit growth, while its service assurance business struggled due to capital constraints from top-tier US carriers. NetScout anticipates its full-year revenue to be at the lower end of its previously stated outlook, with non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) expected to be in line with or slightly above the previous fiscal year. Despite current challenges, NetScout is committed to delivering leading cybersecurity and service assurance solutions.\nIn summary, while NetScout faces challenges in service assurance and competition, its cybersecurity division shows promising growth, and the company is taking strategic steps to strengthen its market position.\nNetScout Systems, Inc. (NTCT) has shown resilience in its cybersecurity segment amidst a challenging fiscal quarter. While the overall revenue has seen a decline, there are several key factors that investors should consider when evaluating the company's prospects.\nInvestingPro Data reveals that NetScout holds a Market Cap of approximately $1.61 billion and a Price to Book ratio of 0.84 as of the last twelve months ending Q3 2024, indicating that the company's stock might be undervalued compared to its assets. Despite a negative Revenue Growth of -7.08% over the last twelve months, the company maintains an impressive Gross Profit Margin of 77.46%, which speaks to the efficiency of its operations and the strength of its core business segments.\nTwo InvestingPro Tips that stand out for NetScout include the company's aggressive share buyback strategy and its strong cash position relative to its debt. Management's decision to repurchase shares can be seen as a sign of confidence in the company's future, while a solid cash-to-debt ratio provides financial flexibility and may be an indicator of financial health.\nFurthermore, NetScout does not pay a dividend to shareholders, which could be a strategic move to reinvest earnings back into the company for growth and innovation, aligning with its focus on cybersecurity solutions. This strategy could be appealing to investors looking for capital appreciation rather than immediate income.\nInvestors interested in a deeper analysis of NetScout Systems can access additional InvestingPro Tips by subscribing to InvestingPro.

I will now turn the call over to Anil for his prepared remarks. Anil?\nAnil Singhal: Thank you, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Welcome and thank you all for joining us today. At a high level, we delivered third quarter revenue and non-GAAP EPS ahead of our expectations due to the timing of customer year-end budget spending and our continued cost containment efforts. However, the macro environment remains challenging with constrained customer spending and elongated sales cycles. We continue to see strength in our cybersecurity business, where we delivered double-digit revenue growth during the first nine months of fiscal year 2024. Our service assurance business continues to face headwinds, primarily due to the Tier-1 U.S. carriers\u2019 capital constrained environment. Accordingly, our enterprise customer vertical was relatively flat for this period, while our service provider customer vertical is creating the majority of the revenue pressure. Given the macro dynamics, we anticipate delivering full fiscal year 2024 revenue at the low end of our previously disclosed outlook range, while our cost containment efforts and other activities should position us to deliver non-GAAP EPS for the full fiscal year at the higher end of our previously disclosed outlook or relatively in-line with last fiscal year\u2019s EPS, on a lower revenue base year-over-year. We will provide more specifics during our remarks. With that as a backdrop, let\u2019s turn to Slide Number 6 for a brief recap of our non-GAAP financial results for the third quarter and first nine months of our fiscal year 2024. For the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, revenue was ahead of our expectations at approximately $218 million, due to the timing of customer year-end budget spending. On a year-over-year basis, this was down approximately 19%, as growth in the cybersecurity product line only partially offset a decline in the service assurance product line for the reasons previously mentioned. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.73, which exceeded our expectations due to higher revenue and lower costs than we previously anticipated. This was a decrease of 27% year-over-year, primarily related to lower revenue, partially offset by continued cost containment efforts and other activities. For the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, or the period ended December 31, 2023, revenue was $626 million, down approximately 11% year-over-year. During this period, our cybersecurity revenue grew more than 13% but was more than offset by a service assurance revenue decline of approximately 20%, both on a year-over-year basis. Excluding radio frequency propagation modeling project revenue from the comparison, service revenue \u2013 service assurance revenue declined approximately 13% year-over-year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the first nine months was $1.65, down approximately [indiscernible] year-over-year as the impact of lower revenue was partially offset by cost containment efforts and a lower share count. Now, let\u2019s move to Slide Number 7 for some further perspective on market and business insights, starting with our enterprise customer vertical. In the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, enterprise revenue was essentially flat year-over-year, as revenue growth in our cybersecurity product lines offset a middle digit percentage decline in our service assurance product line revenue. In the enterprise market, flow through rate continued to be affected by higher spending scrutiny and delayed project funding as customers navigated the current macroeconomic environment. However, some sectors grew year-to-date, such as government and financials, while others, like the healthcare sector, were notably softer. We expect our enhanced cybersecurity solutions and ability to extend visibility to the edge will continue to resonate with our customers. These solutions help protect customers\u2019 networks from attack, cover \u201cblind spots,\u201d address control challenges, and facilitate their leverage of offpremises and cloud solutions within digital transformation and new network architecture initiatives. Moving to our service provider customer vertical. Revenue in the first nine months of the fiscal year declined approximately 22% year-over-year. Excluding radio frequency propagation modeling project revenue from the comparison, the service provider customer vertical revenue declined approximately 13% year-over-year, as revenue growth in our cybersecurity product line was more than offset by a decline in our core service assurance product line revenue. The service provider market remains challenging, especially for the U.S. Tier-1 service providers given capital spending constraints, which is causing intense spending scrutiny and delayed project funding. This dynamic appears to be impacting the finalization of carriers\u2019 new calendar year budgets and funding as well. We expect the challenging market dynamics to persist for the remainder of the fiscal year and likely into the next fiscal year. However, we believe that as 5G adoption accelerates, new use cases advance, and the 5G traffic volumes increase, our core visibility and cybersecurity solutions will be increasingly required. We remain prepared and ready to support carriers through this inevitable transition with our differentiated solutions. Despite the current selling environment, we are encouraged by the interest in our new offerings, like Omnis, and recent traction with our other cybersecurity solutions, particularly our DDoS offerings, including Adaptive DDoS and Mobile Security. Michael will provide more insight regarding customer orders in our verticals during his remarks. Now, let\u2019s move to Slide Number 8 to review our outlook. Looking ahead, taking into consideration the current environment, for the full fiscal year 2024 we expect revenue will be at the low end of our previously disclosed revenue outlook range, or approximately $840 million. We anticipate delivering non-GAAP EPS at the higher end of our previously disclosed EPS outlook range as we continue to benefit from our cost containment efforts and other activities. This would put our non-GAAP EPS relatively in-line with last fiscal year\u2019s EPS, on lower revenue year-over-year. Jean will provide a recap of the outlook in her remarks. Despite the continuation of near-term headwinds, we believe that fundamental longer-term demand trends remain intact for NetScout as enterprises and service providers require industry-leading cybersecurity and service assurance solutions such as ours to deliver actionable visibility at scale. Accordingly, we remain focused on leveraging our industry leading Visibility Without Borders platform to help customers tackle the performance, availability and cybersecurity challenges of the increasingly complex connected digital world. We expect the continued execution of this strategy will enable us to deliver sustainable value for our shareholders. We look forward to sharing our progress with everyone at the conclusion of our fiscal year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael.\nMichael Szabados: Thank you, Anil, and good morning, everyone. Slide 10 outlines the areas that I will be covering today, starting with customer win highlights in the third quarter. In our enterprise customer vertical, during the quarter we displaced a competitor to win a low-seven digit figure \u2013 low-seven figure order from a leading domestic insurance company, which is a new logo for us. The opportunity related to our service assurance solutions needed to address datacenter and hybrid cloud visibility. We won this deal due to our superior technology that addressed incumbent vendor shortfalls and our strong reputation as an industry leader. We believe that there are more opportunities on the horizon to support this new customer with further service assurance deployments as well as potential cybersecurity solutions, given strong explicit interest in this area as well. Turning to our service provider customer vertical, a Tier 1 European carrier renewed a multi-year agreement with us and placed a mid-seven figure order that included both service assurance solutions to advance their 5G network evolution as well as cybersecurity solutions. The order included our recently released Mobile Security Solution that leverages our innovative MobileStream and Sightline offerings to detect DDoS attacks on the mobile network, a product derived from our market-leading solution generally deployed in the fixed line network. We won this opportunity due to our proven technology and strong long-standing incumbent relationship with this customer. As we advance this new Mobile Security Solution we are encouraged by the high interest in this offering as we are actively engaged in multiple deal discussions in addition to a handful of trials across the service provider landscape. Now in terms of go-to-market activities, recently we announced the launch of Adaptive DDoS for Arbor Edge Defense to protect ISPs and enterprises from so called DNS Water Torture Attack as we enhance our solutions with our new technologies. Additionally, we plan to attend Mobile World Congress, MWC in Barcelona in late February, where we will be meeting with existing and prospective customers. Our focus will be on sharing our latest service assurance, AI and ML analytics and cybersecurity solutions related to 5G network visibility and cybersecurity requirements. That concludes my remarks. Thank you everyone. I will now turn the call over to Jean for a review of our financial results.\nJean Bua: Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. I will review key metrics for our third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024 and provide some additional commentary on our fiscal year 2024 outlook. As a reminder, this review focuses on our non-GAAP results unless otherwise stated, and all reconciliations with our GAAP results appear in the presentation appendix. Regardless, I will note the nature of any such comparisons. Slide number 12 details the results for the third quarter and first nine months of our fiscal year 2024. Focusing first on our quarterly performance, total revenue was $218.1 million, down 19.1% year-over-year. Product revenue was $95.8 million, a decrease of 35.9%, while service revenue was $122.2 million, up 1.8% both on a year-over-year basis. Gross profit margin was 81.8% in the third quarter, up 1.3 percentage point\u2019s year-over-year, primarily attributable to higher service revenue and lower variable incentive compensation expense as compared to the last fiscal year. Quarterly operating expenses decreased 5.2% year-over-year primarily due to cost containment efforts including reduced variable incentive compensation. Operating expenses for the quarter included our ENGAGE, User and Technology Event which had historically occurred in our first quarter. We reported an operating profit margin of 29% compared with 35.5% in the same quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.73 compared to $1 in the same quarter last year. Turning to Slide 13, I will review key revenue trends by customer verticals and product lines. Please note that all comparisons here are on a year-over-year basis consistent with our other remarks. For the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, our enterprise customer vertical revenue was effectively flat. Our service provider customer vertical revenue decreased 22.1%. During the same period, our enterprise customer vertical accounted for approximately 54% of our total revenue, while our service provider customer vertical accounted for the remaining 46%. Turning to our product lines. For the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, our cybersecurity revenue increased by 13.5%, while our service assurance revenue decreased by 19.7%. During the same period our service assurance product line accounted for approximately 68% of our total revenue, while our cybersecurity product line accounted for the remaining 32%. Turning to Slide 14, this shows our geographic revenue mix. In the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, 59% of our revenue was derived from the United States, with the remaining 41% provided by international markets. As expected, the mix between domestic and international markets shifted from the same period last year partially due to lower Tier 1 domestic carrier radio frequency propagation modeling project revenue this fiscal year. Also, no customer represented 10% or more of our total revenue in the third quarter or for the first nine months of the fiscal year. Slide 15 details our balance sheet highlights and free cash flow. We ended the third quarter with $330.1 million in cash, cash equivalents, short- and long-term marketable securities and investments, representing a decrease of $2.5 million since the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. Free cash flow for the quarter was $12.7 million. During the third quarter, we repurchased a total of approximately 706,000 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $18.8 million or an average price of $26.66 per share. From a debt perspective, we ended the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 with $100 million outstanding on our $800 million revolving credit facility, which expires in July 2026. To briefly recap other balance sheet highlights: accounts receivable, net, was $221.6 million representing an increase of $77.7 million since March 31, 2023. The DSO metric at the end of the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 was 90 days, versus 69 days at the end of the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 and 58 days at the end of fiscal year 2023. The higher DSO metric in the third quarter of this fiscal year was due to the timing and composition of bookings. Let's move to Slide 16 for commentary on our outlook. I will focus my review on our non-GAAP targets for fiscal year 2024. As Anil noted earlier, we are updating our outlook for fiscal year 2024, which was last presented on November 2, 2023 during our second quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings call. We now anticipate revenue to be approximately $840 million at the lower end of our previously disclosed range. We anticipate non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to now be within the range of $2.15 to $2.20. This is toward the upper end of our previously disclosed range as we benefit from continued cost management efforts as well as a lower tax rate and share count. The effective tax rate is expected to be at the lower end of our range of 20% to 22% as we finalize the tax impacts related to legislation associated with the capitalization of R&D costs. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding is assumed to be between 72 million and 73 million shares, which includes the impact of our recent share repurchase activity. That concludes my formal review of our financial results. Thank you and I'll now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets.\nMatt Hedberg: Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions.\nAnil Singhal: Sure.\nMatt Hedberg: Anil, you noted in your prepared remarks, obviously some of the pressure on service provider spending, I think you said you think some of that could drift into next year, but that 5G could start to improve some spending trends there. I guess I'm wondering, as you talk to customers, I think we've always been sort of curious on what that spark could be on 5G? What are some things that you're hearing from customers that gives you sort of the confidence that some of those trends could start to reverse, something maybe with consumer broadband, anything on the wireless side. Just anything that you're kind of seeing there that kind of gives you the thought that those trends there could start to improve?\nAnil Singhal: Thanks Matt. So I think maybe we can talk about our strategy for next year at a high level rather than some of the estimates from people because they're still finalizing their budget and we keep hearing different stories at different time, even though I've met with almost all of the Tier 1 carriers in the last six months. So what we are looking at it is that with this Omnis product line, we have our data while there is lot of pressure on capital spending on the service assurance solution, but is very good for AIOps type and automation applications. So that's one direction we are talking to them, appeal to a different audience in the customer base and user incumbency. And second is reducing our dependency on the service assurance service provider business. And so with a combination of those things if 5G takes off in other words, there could be some upside. But that's basically what we are looking at because I think it's not deterministic what's going to happen to the capital spending on the traditional service assurance part of our service provider business.\nMatt Hedberg: Got it. That's helpful. And then you noted on this a second ago, I guess just double clicking on the cyber business, which seems to be doing quite well. Are there things that relative to expectations are doing a bit better? And maybe just to double click on that because it feels like there's a lot of good things happening, kind of even below some of the top line growth estimates that we're seeing there?\nAnil Singhal: So if you \u2013 we have mentioned in the past that we didn't integrate the Arbor business, so in high level we have service assurance business which is like 65% of the business. In that we have service provider spending challenges as a bigger issue. Then we have the Arbor business, which also have a service provider enterprise. And then Omnis was introduced just last year and still taking some time for traction. So if Arbor business was integrated into NetScout roughly two years ago and we are seeing the effect on this \u2013 on from a technology point of view we're bringing the DPI technology to the DDoS market. So typically DDoS is for volumetric attack and we have introduced something called adaptive DDoS, which is really application layer attacks. We talked about \u2013 Michael talked about DNS Water Torture Attack and that's driving this growth this year and hopefully this will continue next year.\nMatt Hedberg: Thank you very much, appreciate the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Jim Fish with Piper Sandler.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, guys. Thank you. This is Quinto on for Jim; maybe double clicking on Matt's second question there. We've heard from both you and other vendors in the space about the acceleration of those DDoS attacks that have occurred this year. Can you talk about any relationship you've seen between the pace or the volume of these attacks and your cyber performance in the past? And as we look towards Fiscal 2025 is this something that could kind of reaccelerate or continue to accelerate security growth as customers may be nearing their upper end of capacity and are in need for an upgrade?\nAnil Singhal: Yeah. Sure. So first thing that I want to mention that on our website, we publish a threat report which talks about how the attacks are morphing and like there are attacks called carpet-bombing attack, which is new, which is basically, you \u2013 instead of attacking a server, you basically attack multiple devices in customer\u2019s network. It's very hard to detect. And then there's a DNS water torture attacks where you bring down a DNS server, then nobody can do anything. So these are the two areas we introduce new functionality. So yes, attacks are increasing, but we are now handling new kinds of attacks, which we call Adaptive DDoS, and we think there's going to be that there is a lot of interest in that. Plus Arbor business was more service provider business. NetScout had a lot of enterprise business. So as we combined the sales forces, we are seeing traction on the enterprise portion of DDoS, which is our AD \u2013 AED product which is different than in the past.\nUnidentified Analyst: Makes a lot of sense. And then maybe, for Anil, for you, in your prepared remarks, you talked about benefiting from the year-end budget flush, it sounds like this was more on that cyber side. But can you walk through any verticals or segments specifically that benefited from this flush compared to last year? Thank you.\nAnil Singhal: Yes. Maybe Jean can add to this. But this was not necessarily budget flush. Maybe some of the orders from Q4 went into Q3. And so we didn't see this traditional budget flush, which we have seen in the past, especially after COVID. Jean, anything you'd like to say?\nJean Bua: No. You are correct. Anil, when we had given our color for Q3, we were not sure whether the \u2013 our customers would be using their calendar year 2023 budgets or start using their calendar year 2024 budgets, hence the skew between our Q3 and our Q4. And so what we found was that they did use their 2023 budgets, which is our fiscal calendar \u2013 fiscal year Q3 year.\nUnidentified Analyst: Fantastic. Appreciate it.\nAnil Singhal: Sure, Jim.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Kevin Liu with K. Liu & Company.\nKevin Liu: Hi, good morning. Just wanted to ask, about kind of your early expectations for next fiscal year. Specifically on the cybersecurity side, given what you're seeing in terms of pipeline build for your new products versus some of the growth coming from the Arbor side of the business? How should we think about, what the mix of business on cybersecurity and ultimately, should we expect that to accelerate growth or do you think it'll stay pretty consistent with what you've seen over the past 12 months?\nAnil Singhal: Yes. So this one was much higher growth versus in the past and like I mentioned some of the integration of technology, some of the new product resulted in that. I also want to add that we also have a product called Omnis Security, which is in the NDR space. And so when we talk about security revenue, we will include both of them. This year Omnis Security has not picked up, so bulk of the growth is because of Arbor. So we think that security growth will be better \u2013 continue to be better than the service assurance next year also. And hence the percentage of security might go higher and but we should be able to provide some guidance on this in the next earnings call.\nKevin Liu: Understood. And then Anil, could you also elaborate a little bit on kind of the opportunities outside of Tier-1 service provider as we move into this current calendar year? Just wondering if you believe there's enough opportunity there to help offset some of the declines that might be coming from the capital spending side. Yes, if you could just talk about that a little bit?\nAnil Singhal: I think, the challenge is, Kevin, is in that there are cheaper price incumbents on the lower end of the market beyond the top 10 or 20 where we already are coverage. So I see in service assurance the bigger opportunities 5G takes off in terms of user plan much faster or, and or doing something with the Mobile Security area or applying some of our solution to AI use cases like heavy user bandwidth, air fiber which is like the fiber over FTTH, which is AT&T recently announced. And so those are the trends which are going to be, but I think going after that below Tier-1 or where we are not incumbent, I see is hard because there are a lot of regional vendors and there is very big price competition.\nKevin Liu: Got it. That's helpful. Thanks for taking the questions.\nAnil Singhal: Sure.\nOperator: This does conclude the question-and-answer portion of today's call. So I'd like to turn the call back over to Tony for any additional or closing remarks.\nTony Piazza: Thank you, operator. That concludes our call for today. Thank you all for joining us and enjoy the rest of the day.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's program and we appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor. For more information see our T&C."

As usual, I will begin the call with an overview of the fourth quarter and full year results, and then I'll be turning the call over to Tom and Bob, who'll provide further details. After they're done, I'll wrap things up, and then we'll be glad to take questions. Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter 2023 net income of $189 million or $2.10 per share. Excluding special items, fourth quarter 2023 net income was $192 million or $2.13 per share, compared to the fourth quarter of 2022\u2019s net income of $215 million or $2.35 per share. Fourth quarter net sales were $1.94 billion in 2023 and $1.98 billion in 2022. Total company EBITDA for the fourth quarter, excluding special items was $394 million in 2023 and $409 million in 2022. Excluding the special items, we also reported full year 2023 earnings of $784 million or $8.70 per share compared to the 2022 earnings of $1.04 billion or $11.14 per share. Net sales were $7.8 billion in 2023 and $8.5 billion in 2022. Excluding special items, total company EBITDA in 2023 was $1.6 billion compared to the $1.9 billion in 2022. Fourth quarter and full year 2023 net income included special items primarily for certain costs at our Jackson, Alabama mill for the paper-to-containerboard conversion-related activities and the closure and other costs related to corrugated products facilities and design center. Details of all special items for the year 2023 and 2022 were included in the schedules that accompanied our earnings press release. Excluding the special items, the $0.22 per share decrease in fourth quarter 2023 earnings compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 was driven primarily by lower prices and mix of $1.93 in the Packaging segment, lower prices and mix $0.04, and volume $0.03 in the Paper segment and higher depreciation expense $0.10. These items were partially offset by very good volume in the Packaging segment of $1.07 per share. We also had lower operating and converting costs of $0.51 driven by very good process efficiencies and control over other usages of fiber, chemicals, energy, materials and labor as well as lower energy and wood fiber prices. In addition, we had lower scheduled maintenance outage expenses of $0.19, lower freight and logistics expenses $0.03, lower other expenses $0.04 and a lower share count resulting from share repurchases $0.04. The results were $0.37 above the fourth quarter guidance of $1.76 per share, primarily due to higher volumes in our Packaging segment, lower operating and converting costs, lower freight and logistics expenses. Looking at the Packaging business. EBITDA excluding special items in the fourth quarter of 2023 of $385 million with sales of $1.8 billion resulted in a margin of 21.7% versus last year's EBITDA of $392 million and sales of $1.8 billion and also a 21.7% margin. For the full year 2023, Packaging segment EBITDA, excluding special items was $1.6 billion with sales of $7.1 billion or 21.8% margin compared to the full year 2022 EBITDA of $1.8 billion with sales of $7.8 billion or a 23.8% margin. Throughout the quarter, demand in the Packaging segment was stronger than our expectations. This higher volume along with the operational benefits of our capital spending program and continued emphasis on cost management and process efficiencies across the entire manufacturing and converting facility system drove operating and converting costs lower as well. We had an excellent restart of the Wallula, Washington mill and the No. 3 machine during the latter part of October and ran exceptionally well during the November, December period. And that helped us meet the stronger demand and build some needed inventory during the quarter to ensure the customers \u2013 that our customers were supplied with their needs. We plan to restart the No. 2 machine at the Wallula mill in this first quarter to help manage our expectations in the first half of 2024 for continued strong demand together with scheduled mill maintenance outages and the final phase of the containerboard conversion of the No. 3 machine at our Jackson, Alabama mill. I'll now turn it over to Tom, who'll provide more details on containerboard sales and the corrugated business.\nTom Hassfurther: Thank you, Mark. As Mark mentioned, Packaging segment volume for the quarter exceeded our guidance estimates. Corrugated product shipments per workday were up 5.1% and total shipments with one additional shipping day were up 6.9% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Versus the third quarter of 2023, shipments per day were up 5.2% and total shipments were up 3.4%, even though there was one less shipping day. Outside sales volume of containerboard was 88,000 tons above last year's fourth quarter and 17,000 tons above the third quarter of 2023. Our order backlog and containerboard cut-up remained incredibly strong throughout the quarter. Although demand continues to be challenged by persistent inflation, higher interest rates and other factors, we expect our shipments to continue this positive momentum as we enter the first half of 2024. Relative to the published reductions in the industry benchmark grades that occurred in 2023, Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $1.73 per share below the fourth quarter of 2022 and down $0.40 per share, compared to the third quarter of 2023, which included a richer mix of graphics and point-of-purchase display business. Export containerboard prices and mix were down $0.20 per share, compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 and down $0.01 per share compared to the third quarter of 2023. Beginning January 1, 2024, we began invoicing a $70 per ton price increase for linerboard and $100 per ton increase for medium according to our recent price announcement. As you are probably aware, this past Friday, the RISI Pulp and Paper Week publication did not recognize any increase in the industry's benchmark prices for either linerboard or medium. I'm sure you will have some questions for us on this topic, and we'll be happy to discuss them with you shortly. I'll turn it back to Mark.\nMark Kowlzan: Thanks, Tom. Looking at the Paper segment, EBITDA excluding special items in the fourth quarter was $35 million with sales of $144 million or a 24.5% margin compared to the fourth quarter of 2022's EBITDA of $39 million and sales of $154 million or 25.7% margin. For the full year 2023, Paper segment EBITDA, excluding special items was $151 million with sales of $595 million or a record 25.3% margin compared to the full year 2022 EBITDA of $132 million with sales of $622 million or a 21.3% margin. Prices and mix were down 3% from last year's fourth quarter and from the third quarter of 2023, driven by the declines in the index prices that occurred during the year. Although, slightly better than our fourth quarter guidance, sales volume was 3% below last year's fourth quarter and down approximately 6% versus the seasonally stronger third quarter of 2023. The management team and all the employees of our paper business have done a tremendous job over the last several quarters to optimize our inventory and product mix, and remain focused on efficient and cost-effective operations in order to continue delivering outstanding results during 2023. I'll now turn it over to Bob.\nBob Mundy: Thanks Mark. Cash provided by operations during the quarter totaled $335 million and free cash flow was $194 million. The primary payments of cash during the quarter included capital expenditures of $141 million, dividend payments of $112 million, cash tax payments of $59 million and net interest payments of $26 million. For the full year 2023, cash from operations was $1.3 billion with capital spending of $470 million and free cash flow, a record $845 million. Our final recurring effective tax rate for 2023 was 24.5%. During the fourth quarter, we issued $400 million of new 10-year notes. The proceeds from these notes will be used to redeem our $400 million notes that mature in September of 2024. Our net debt is not affected by this transaction and the proceeds from this issuance will be invested in marketable securities at an interest rate exceeding that of the new notes. The new bonds raised our overall fixed interest rate by approximately 30 basis points and extended the overall average maturity of our debt portfolio from 14.1 years to 15.6 years. Excluding the proceeds from this transaction, our year-end cash on-hand balance, including marketable securities, was just over $800 million, with liquidity of $1.1 billion. Regarding full year estimates of certain key items for the upcoming year, we expect total capital expenditures to be in the range of $470 million to $490 million. And DD&A is expected to be approximately $530 million. We estimate dividend payments of $450 million and cash pension and post-retirement benefit plan contributions of $27 million. Our full year interest expense in 2024 is expected to be approximately $53 million and net cash interest payments should be about $60 million. The estimate for our 2024 book effective tax rate is 25%. Currently, planned annual outages at our mills in 2024 including lost volume, direct costs and amortized repair costs is expected to total $0.96 per share. The current estimated impact by quarter in 2024 is $0.26 per share in the first quarter, $0.16 in the second, $0.19 in the third and $0.35 per share in the fourth quarter. These expenses include the volume and cost impact that will be incurred during the completion of the final phase of converting the No. 3 machine at the Jackson mill to containerboard during the first and second quarters. This will negatively impact our first quarter results by approximately $0.16 per share and our second quarter results by $0.08 per share. I'll now turn it back over to Mark.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you, Bob. I'm very proud of the outstanding results PCA delivered in 2023 under very challenging demand conditions. We successfully completed numerous cost reduction and process improvement projects along with other key strategic initiatives at the containerboard mills and corrugated products plants. Our dedicated sales and customer service organizations continue to be extremely motivated and understanding the business of our customers. They were very responsive to our customers' needs and works proactively to help them with their solutions to their opportunities and their challenges. These combined efforts allowed us to enhance our entire packaging business and deliver profitable growth opportunities for our customers and shareholders now and into the future. 2023 also saw our paper business deliver record margins reflecting the capabilities of our employees to optimize our product mix, inventory, distribution channels and overhead structure, along with running very efficient manufacturing operations. These accomplishments helped us to achieve a new all-time annual record free cash flow. We ended the year with over $1.1 billion of liquidity and extended the overall average debt maturity to almost 16 years. We continued our commitment to a strong balance sheet and a balanced approach towards capital allocation. This allows us to profitably grow the company and to maximize returns for our shareholders, while maintaining the financial flexibility to react quickly to situations and opportunities. None of these things would be possible without the hard work of the talented employees and strong partnerships we\u2019ve built with our customers and suppliers over many, many years. Looking ahead, as we move from the fourth and into the first quarter, as Tom indicated in our Packaging segment, we expect continued positive momentum in demand, along with two additional shipping days in the first quarter to drive higher total corrugated product shipments. Despite restarting the No. 2 machine at the Wallula mill, containerboard volume will be lower due to the downtime associated with the conversion of the No. 3 machine at the Jackson mill and a scheduled maintenance outage at the Counce, Tennessee mill. Prices and mix should be slightly higher with the implementation of our announced January price increases partially offset by a decrease in the published benchmark prices that occurred late in 2023 with export prices fairly flat. In our Paper segment, we expect an improved mix to move prices slightly higher with flat sales volume. Recycled fiber and energy prices will be higher and unusually cold seasonal weather will negatively impact usages and yields for energy, wood and chemicals, along with higher operating costs associated with the restart of the full operations at the Wallula mill compared to the fourth quarter operations. Labor and benefits costs will have seasonal timing related increases that occur at the beginning of a new year related to annual wage and benefit increases, the restart of payroll taxes and share-based compensation expenses. And finally, as Bob mentioned, scheduled outage expenses will include the significant first quarter impact of the conversion outage at the Jackson mill, which is estimated to be $0.16 per share. Considering these items, we expect the first quarter earnings of $1.54 per share. And with that, Jamie, I\u2019d like to open the call for questions. And we can proceed as you call it out. Thanks, Jamie.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Mark Weintraub from Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead with your question.\nMark Weintraub: Thank you. First, congrats on another really strong year in a challenging environment. So you say in the press release that that you are expecting a little slightly higher pricing despite the $20 decrease in November. And obviously you\u2019re including some from the January increase, which as you mentioned, we\u2019re going to have questions undoubtedly. Is that fair to say that you\u2019re including a little bit more than $20 on average in the 1Q? How should we think about that?\nTom Hassfurther: Yes, Mark, this Tom. Yes, it\u2019s slightly above the $20. We\u2019ve got the follow through on that published $20 down. And as I said, we put the linerboard of medium price increase into effect January 1. And we\u2019re invoicing accordingly and getting paid accordingly. And I might also add that as a net buyer, we also have accepted the $70 increase on the buy side and have been paying invoices accordingly.\nMark Weintraub: Okay. And sorry, just to clarify, so when you said net $20, was that the increase minus the impact of the $20, or was that that you\u2019re effectively, because of the way the lags work, et cetera, as you push it through into box prices, that the impact of the $70 that\u2019s been announced is slightly more than $20 in the first quarter? I apologize for the question, but just clarify.\nTom Hassfurther: Yes, you\u2019re pretty much right. And you got to also think about it is, is the $20 is factoring into the box business right now given contract triggers.\nMark Weintraub: Got it. Understood. And lastly and I\u2019ll turn over. Could you sense of how demand is shaping up in January so far for the business?\nTom Hassfurther: Yes, demand remains very strong. We\u2019re currently booking and billing about 8% above a year ago, and we see that trend continuing through the quarter.\nMark Weintraub: Okay. Thank you.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you, Mark. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sandra Liang from Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead with your question. Sandra, your line is live. Is it possible your phone may be on mute?\nMark Kowlzan: Jamie, let\u2019s move to the next question.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Mike Roxland from Truist. Please go ahead with your question.\nMike Roxland: Yes. Thank you, Mark, Bob, Bob and Tom for taking my questions. Congrats on a really good quarter.\nTom Hassfurther: Thank you.\nBob Mundy: Thanks.\nMike Roxland: Just wanted to get a sense from you regarding the mix in 4Q. Box prices looked like they were notably down sequentially year-over-year. Now, aside from lower price, were there any one-time mix issues as well? And I recall that in 3Q, you called out weaker building products, lower graphics from softer retail, UAW strike. I\u2019m wondering if that had an impact in 4Q as well, and whether you expect that to fade in 2024.\nTom Hassfurther: Mike, our fourth Q mix was about what we expected it to be. At the end of the third quarter we had a little more graphics business that came in, which was positive. But our mix in the fourth quarter followed pretty much true to form. And going into this year, I think that with some of those headwinds that you talked about behind us, especially the destocking, which was very unpredictable that we incurred during 2023, it\u2019s kind of steady as she goes in 2024.\nMike Roxland: Got it. Thank you, Tom. So would it be fair to say that in 4Q, some of those issues you mentioned in 3Q last time continued a little bit in 4Q and that\u2026\nTom Hassfurther: Yes, they did a little bit into 4Q. They did. But then they began to settle out towards the end of the year.\nMike Roxland: Okay. Got it. Thank you for that. And then just of the $1.93 in lower prices and mix, is there anyway to parse how much was price versus mix? And then in terms of your \u2013 the $1.54 guide, what\u2019s embedded for price and mix separately?\nTom Hassfurther: Well, I think it\u2019s \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s mostly price, obviously, but then it does get impacted by mix and that kind of varies back and forth. So we try to do the best we can to forecast that.\nMike Roxland: Got it. So Tom, would it be fair to say you\u2019re expecting \u2013 given destocking coming to an end, given some of these issues mentioned previously in my question. Probably you expect a better quality, a high quality mix in 2024 versus 2023.\nTom Hassfurther: I think our mix will be traditional to what we typically have.\nMike Roxland: Got it. And last question just before turning it over. Can you help us just think about what\u2019s next for PKG from a growth perspective? Obviously, you\u2019re finishing up Jackson here. And you still have I Falls. Now realizing that I Falls is a great asset, it\u2019s modern, generates a lot of cash, [indiscernible] paper. Do you expect to run I Falls as is? What\u2019s really the next leg of the growth trajectory for PKG after this?\nMark Kowlzan: Yes. Mike, you know, obviously you don\u2019t know what the future is going to hold. But we\u2019ve got a lot of optionality in what we\u2019re doing. All of the capital spending that we continue to do in the box plants, as an example, continues to create incredible opportunity to grow with our customers. Just this year alone, for 2024, we planned over 30 strategic projects at 26 of our box plants. And this is major converting equipment installations, corrugators, corrugator rebuilds and upgrades of significant magnitude. This past year it was the same situation. Number of evolves, rotary die cutters, corrugators, new plant in Pennsylvania, the start of a new plant out in Salt Lake City. And so we will continue to build in the internal organic capability to grow with the marketplace. Mills have the runway to continue providing that over the next few years. And then you have to assume, as we have always done, we can grow the containerboard supply as we need to, whether it\u2019s adding capacity in an existing mill or if we had to go out and buy a mill or build a mill. There\u2019s a lot of optionality in the future that we have the ability to proceed with. But that\u2019s never been an issue for us. And I don\u2019t expect it to be an issue in the future. But right now, the key is that we have tremendous capability within the converting side of the packaging unit and the mill system to provide the containerboard to grow for the next number of years. So I\u2019m very, very encouraged by where we are.\nMike Roxland: That\u2019s great, Mark and very good call. I really appreciate it. And best of luck in 2024.\nMark Kowlzan: Thanks, Mike. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from George Staphos from Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead with your question.\nCashen Keeler: Yes. Hi, good morning. This is actually Cashen Keeler sitting in for George. He had an internal conflict this morning. So I guess just back to the pricing discussion. Are you able to comment at all in terms of what percent of your customer base you\u2019re invoicing at those higher prices in both containerboard and boxes?\nTom Hassfurther: Well, with regard to linerboard and medium, I\u2019m talking about linerboard of medium here. It\u2019s 100% of our customers, outside customers on linerboard of medium and trade partners as well. So that\u2019s where that stands. And I just like to add, we\u2019re having no customer dispute us on these price increases or anything. And obviously we\u2019re disappointed that it didn\u2019t show up in the trade publication, as I mentioned earlier. And right now we have customers that are incredibly frustrated with the mechanism right now and feel that there\u2019s a disconnect between what they see going on in the market and what\u2019s being reported. Now maybe some of that is because the outside market has shrunk so severely that it\u2019s quite small now. And we don\u2019t want the tail wagging the dog here, but we\u2019ve got customers now both on the liner and the box side that are asking us to look for alternatives. And we\u2019ll be exploring any and all alternatives going forward, including maybe not even using an index, but we\u2019ll kind of give you some color on that going forward as that progresses. But I just wanted to make you aware of where our customer base is and how they feel about certain things at the moment.\nCashen Keeler: Okay. Appreciate that color. And then in terms of production, was the cost of production in 4Q where you had anticipated in packaging? I know you commented that you had lower operating converting costs year-over-year. But just interested if there were any items that were higher than you expected kind of in there? And as you look out for the rest of 1Q, any kind of cost items or lines that might give you pause. I know you commented the fiber and energy and chemist, but since shutdown those items.\nBob Mundy: Yes. This is Bob. I would just say, relative to 4Q, maybe OCC prices that was probably a little higher than what we had baked in. But maybe there were some, what we call, other fixed type costs around some services and equipment rentals, some outside, things like that, maybe just a touch higher. But all in, it was certainly a very good quarter from a cost perspective relative to what we had guided to. As far as the first \u2013 going to the first quarter from the fourth, there are some moving parts there. Some of them are just not what we normally see. Obviously, we pointed out the big significant change that we\u2019re being impacted by relative to the Jackson conversion, which is on a sequential basis, is $0.16 per share. But outside of that, if you look at all of our other costs, there\u2019s probably 60% or so of those are what we call seasonal or timing type cost increases. Those would be weather-related, which are actually a little more severe going 4Q to 1Q this year, because of so much cold weather down in the southern mills and the box plants, which typically we don\u2019t see much of a change relative to usages and things that get impacted by cold weather down there. And then the wages and benefits. The base \u2013 that base gets larger every year. You never have deflation with your wages and benefits. So the annual increases that we experienced going from 4Q and to start a new year in 1Q, it just gets higher and higher, the dollar impact of that. Plus this year, our medical costs alone, they were up probably over 12% to 15%. However, on a sequential basis, the weather-related items should flip back the other way as we move from 1Q to 2Q and 2Q to 3Q, as should about half of the \u2013 those wage-related timing items. Those start to flip back the other way on a sequential basis. You have to sort of keep that in mind going forward. And I\u2019d say the balance of well, I guess one other item is we talked about bringing Wallula on in the first quarter and taking Jackson down, so we\u2019re replacing low-cost tons with very high cost tons. That\u2019s a \u2013 that\u2019s probably a $0.10 hit in and of itself right there, exclusive of the outage impact that $0.16. And then the balance of that is just inflation related things that don\u2019t get talked about a lot. For all these cost increases we incur, believe me, anyone who provides a part, a good product service to us, they\u2019re experiencing those same increases. So there\u2019s a lot of outside services, equipment rentals, rents, property taxes even. You can go on and on and on. All that is \u2013 it\u2019s a lot of money that we have to absorb especially on \u2013 you see it mostly in a sequential nature going from 4Q to 1Q. So, I hope that gives you a little color about what\u2019s in those numbers for the \u2013 for our guidance.\nCashen Keeler: Great. Thanks for the details.\nMark Kowlzan: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gabrial Hajde from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.\nGabrial Hajde: Mark, Tom, good morning. Thanks for taking the question.\nMark Kowlzan: Morning, Gabe.\nGabrial Hajde: I wanted to ask a little bit on the demand side. Historically speaking, you guys have done a good job of kind of outperforming the industry or even exceeding that kind of the GDP type growth. But this quarter was seemingly pretty pronounced relative to what we\u2019re reading maybe in the green markets report or REFI [ph]. So, I\u2019m just curious if there\u2019s anything that you can talk about, I mean, I know historically, you guys haven\u2019t talked about like a vitality index or something like that. But just maybe new business wins that you all are excited about or change incentive structure for your sales folks to go out and win new business.\nTom Hassfurther: Gabe, the majority of our increase in volume came from our existing customers. As we\u2019ve said many, many times, I mean, that\u2019s our main growth engine. And we tried to align with the right kind of customers who, over the long haul, will grow. And I think that\u2019s been a big plus for us. Are we winning any new business? Yes. We win some new business, some other business goes the other way. It\u2019s over the \u2013 over time, we do come out ahead. But as you mentioned, I mean, historically, we have outperformed the industry, and we plan to do so going forward. But we did lag as you probably know, for a number of quarters. Over the last couple of years, there were times when we did lag. And it\u2019s because of some of the segments that we were in. And I mentioned before, as an example, I mean, building products went crazy during COVID and then suddenly that came to a screeching halt. And so some of these segments that we\u2019re in did hold us back, but they\u2019re coming back now nicely and that\u2019s a big part of our growth.\nGabrial Hajde: Okay. Thank you. And then maybe two questions on the Jackson conversion. It sounds like \u2013 I know sometimes that they\u2019re not always directly linked in terms of when the costs flow through and the guidance that you gave us, Bob, in terms of the $0.26 and the $0.16. But is that happening? Is it straddling in March, April from a timing standpoint? And then I\u2019ll ask a question. I don\u2019t know if you guys will answer, but on a sequential basis, if the $70 and $100 a ton is going through, and by our math, that\u2019s, to your point, Mark, maybe $25 a ton is being reflected in Q1, then is it fair that the extra $50 a ton incremental should be on a sequential basis embedded into the second quarter? Thank you.\nUnidentified Company Representative: [Technical Difficulty]\nTom Hassfurther: Right. Well, we\u2019re in the midst of discussing all that with our customers, especially on the box side and what the roll through will be, et cetera. So, as I mentioned, we got the increase in place for the linerboard medium. And we\u2019ll see where things roll through, but we expect it to be a traditional roll through.\nGabrial Hajde: Thank you.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Please go ahead with your question.\nAnthony Pettinari: Hi Good morning.\nMark Kowlzan: Good morning, Anthony.\nAnthony Pettinari: Hey, following up on your earlier comments, I\u2019m wondering, is there some percentage of your box contracts that are not on Pulp and Paper Week? And I guess, looking at other paper grades, there were some boxboard producers we didn\u2019t feel like the index was really reflecting what was really happening in the market, and they were able to move some customers off a Pulp and Paper Week. Is that something that you potentially could do? Or you think some customers might welcome? Just wondering if you \u2013 to the extent you can discuss how you think about that?\nTom Hassfurther: Well, Anthony, as I mentioned, I mean, we do have a high level of frustration both with customers, both on the liner and on the box side. With Pulp and Paper and feel that there\u2019s a disconnect there to what they see in the market and what\u2019s being reported. As I\u2019ve said for a number of years now, as this independent market continues to shrink and what we really consider to be a real open market gets into the mid-single digits. And if that\u2019s all that\u2019s being reported on, that becomes quite a \u2013 can cause that disconnect, in my opinion. So our customers have asked us to look at a lot of different alternatives in which we are doing, along with them, and we\u2019ll see where we end up. Have we moved some people off of that? We don\u2019t really like to get into those kind of details just because that\u2019s between us and our customers. So, I\u2019ll leave that one aside, because we\u2019re not going to really get into those discussions other than I just will tell you, we are looking at any and all alternatives.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then just switching gears on the CapEx guidance for 2024. I think you said $470 million to $490 million CapEx. Is it possible to break that down between maintenance, discretionary and then Jackson. And is there any kind of finer point in terms of the run rate capacity add from Jackson when that conversion is completed?\nBob Mundy: Yes. As far as I would say Jackson will be $30 million to $40 million of that amount. The balance, I\u2019d say 65% or so would be sort of that nondiscretionary must-do type maintenance-type capital spending. And Mark, you talked about?\nMark Kowlzan: Yes, I mean we\u2019re probably spending close to $250 million just in the box plants alone this year. And that\u2019s all of the 30 strategic projects we\u2019re working on the box plants and building the new plant out in Salt Lake City and finishing that up. And then the rest will be just in the smaller one-off projects in the mills. And then obviously, we\u2019ve got the maintenance-type capital that goes on. But the bulk of its \u2013 quite frankly, the bulk of its in the box plants. And then finish up the Jackson conversion.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay. And is there a final number on the Jackson capacity add in terms of how much \u2013 how many tons that you would expect that to add when it\u2019s completed?\nMark Kowlzan: The machine certainly ought to be able to add approximately 175,000 to 200,000 more incremental tons a year when we\u2019re done with this phase of work. I believe the number for 2023 is production of that machine was somewhere around 537,000 tons of production for 2023. So if you add 200,000 more tons that you\u2019re up in that 700,000 tons capability. But again, it all depends on our demand. And so we\u2019re going to run to demand, as we always have, but that\u2019s the necessity of being able to build this runway that our customers can depend on and they know they can grow with us and we can supply them the product and the value they need. And so the Jackson machine is going to have that capability to ramp up and ramp down, and provide all the grades we need at an incredibly attractive cost position.\nAnthony Pettinari: Got it. Got it. I\u2019ll turn it over.\nMark Kowlzan: Okay. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Phil Ng from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.\nPhil Ng: Hey guys, congrats on a really strong quarter. Your business is relatively a shorter cycle business, but it certainly seem pretty confident on the demand outlook for the first half with capacity bringing back online. What are your customers selling? Are there any pockets of end markets that kind of really stand out where you\u2019re seeing demand kind of bounce back in a bigger way? And are you seeing any restocking after a year\u2019s worth of destocking effectively?\nTom Hassfurther: Phil, I think the demand outlook obviously remains good. It\u2019s pretty much across the board. There\u2019s no one industry that stands out more than the other, other than maybe e-commerce. Because you still see the brick-and-mortar stores continue to struggle a little bit, but that\u2019s more than offset by the e-commerce side of the business. So that remains quite good. And I think relative to restocking, I would say that the restocking has been quite conservative to date. Nobody jumped up and said, \"I\u2019m going back to where I was during COVID\" or anything like that, they\u2019re trying to be reasonably conservative going forward. And \u2013 but \u2013 so I think we saw a little bit \u2013 we probably saw a little bit of a jump as a result of that, but nothing like we saw on the destocking side.\nPhil Ng: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then I guess a question for Bob. If I look at your last two quarters, operational and converting costs were down pretty sharply, which is impressive especially with Wallula come back on. Preaching the first half of the year you\u2019re going to have some outage expense of Jackson. But some of the gains you saw in the back half, is that pretty sticky, and that\u2019s still to come? And I know you guys talked about all these different projects you guys are working on the box side of things. So kind of help us think through that driver potentially good or bad this year.\nBob Mundy: I\u2019m sorry, what did you say was sticky feel? I didn\u2019t catch that part.\nPhil Ng: The operational and converting cost, that came down pretty nicely in the back half of 2023. I\u2019m just trying to gauge should we expect follow-through in 2024, especially with some of the investments you\u2019re making in the box plants? Is that a good guy as well?\nBob Mundy: No, absolutely. I mean, as we\u2019ve said many times, that never stops. It\u2019s not just capital projects. It\u2019s things that don\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s just changing behavior, a technique, a process. It doesn\u2019t cost money comparing to others new things, new technologies, new ideas, and those thousands of those things are going on every year. And that is really what drives those reductions that we\u2019ve talked about historically, and that certainly will continue in the future.\nMark Kowlzan: One good example of that, and we don\u2019t talk about a lot, our transportation capability. Over the last decade, we\u2019ve built an incredibly strong transportation logistics group within the company, and it\u2019s nationwide now. We\u2019ve got a very large fleet of tractors and trailers running the country, taking care of not only containerboard, but a lot of our packaging to the customer. And so that capability of having our own trucking in-house has provided enormous flexibility in cost management on the transportation side of the equation. So that\u2019s just one example of how we go about looking at our business and then executing.\nPhil Ng: Super. Just one last one for me. I think on the prepared remarks, you called about $1.1 billion of liquidity. Mark, you highlighted being balanced in terms of capital deployment. Any opportunities perhaps to play a little offense in a market that\u2019s a little more distressed, especially some of the capacity that\u2019s come on. Is that an opportunity? You guys are obviously growing pretty nicely and generate a ton of free cash flow here.\nMark Kowlzan: I\u2019ll let you know when it happens. That\u2019s the beauty of having that firepower. We can not only continue to look at share buyback and dividends. But if an opportunity comes up on a one-off on the packaging side to buy an existing business, we can easily move into that. If something on the mill side came up that we found attractive, we can move into that and not worry about how we finance it or how it affects the balance sheet. And so the other thing I want to remind everybody, back when we called out the 2023s capital, and we \u2013 the 2022 capital up over $800 million. And we reminded everybody that the 2022 capital would be going down into a much more manageable level, much more reasonable level in that $400 million range. Just keep in mind, we did that, and we accomplished an incredible amount of high-return projects and impact projects that benefit our customers and our shareholders alike. But also this year, we continued that trend. The $400 million range of high-return, high-impact projects affords us again an incredible opportunity with the balance sheet because all that operating cash that we\u2019re generating goes into free cash and can be deployed appropriately. And so we\u2019re in a very good place. Over the last 10 years, we\u2019ve done all the heavy lifting to get the mills and the box plants in very, very efficient condition. And so now it\u2019s much more manageable about how we go about with these projects. And so with the fact that we have the internal capability with the engineering and technology organization to manage the bulk of all this work. We\u2019re in a much better position than we\u2019ve ever been and we\u2019ll continue that. But again, all optionality is open for us on how we look at the world.\nPhil Ng: Okay. Appreciate that\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question is a follow-up from Mark Weintraub from Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead with your follow up.\nMark Weintraub: Thank you. So can you share with us the types of alternatives on pricing structures that might be contemplated? Would they be more cost tied? Would they be more macro or data tied? Would it be more just going and negotiating with counterparties, some combination? Or any color as to kind of where the bias might be from your perspective?\nTom Hassfurther: Mark, it\u2019s nice that you\u2019re thinking about it, and I appreciate all your options that you just presented, but I\u2019m not going to get into that at all because, as I told you before, that\u2019s between us and our customers. And we\u2019ll work those out as we go forward. So, I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t give you anything, but that\u2019s the way we do business.\nMark Weintraub: Totally understood. Is there anything that may have been missing that would have been in the list recognizing there\u2019s going to be a whole bunch of things that you\u2019re going to be talking about with your customers\u2026\nTom Hassfurther: Nice try, but I\u2019m going ditto again. Okay.\nMark Weintraub: Yes. I did try. And then Bob, you had mentioned about 60% of the costs increased from 4Q to 1Q seasonal or timing. Could you sort of put a number on that? Would that be like $0.20 per share? And if it we were just \u2013 had that 6% come back in the second quarter?\nBob Mundy: Mark, it\u2019d be closer to 35%, maybe a little more per share.\nMark Weintraub: Right. Okay. Thank you so much.\nMark Kowlzan: Okay. Thank you, Mark. Any other questions, please?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is also a follow-up from Gabrial Hajde from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your follow-up.\nGabrial Hajde: Tom, Mark, I\u2019m going to try one more time. So, I apologize in advance, but it\u2019s more trying to understand the thought process. And I think the price discovery process that we\u2019ve seen over the past 25 years, what we\u2019re hearing is maybe is not as bulletproof or as useful as it maybe once was. And so maybe really what we\u2019re hearing is and something I think is misunderstood in the industry, is that you guys sell boxes that are made to a spec that service a customer\u2019s needs as opposed to selling a customer a parent roll of paper. And so is it fair that maybe what\u2019s going on behind the scenes is the value that you\u2019re bringing to your customers is really what you\u2019re trying to understand and work with them to help them understand ultimately and move the pricing structure to something like that.\nTom Hassfurther: Well, Gabe, you described it very well. I got to be honest with you. There is a linerboard and medium market, and then there\u2019s a box market. And the box market is all custom-made. Lots of different things go into it, and there\u2019s a value created accordingly. So you \u2013 as I\u2019ve said before, I\u2019m not going to get into all the optionality and all those other sorts of things, those things we\u2019ll discuss with our customers. But you do describe it accurately, I think, especially from our customers\u2019 point of view, that what gets reported is quite different than what they see in the marketplace. And just as an example, I mean, even when the prices went down, over the past 18 months or so. There isn\u2019t a customer who said, I see that there\u2019s a need for that or that they saw that in the marketplace. So we\u2019ve got \u2013 what we\u2019re hearing from our customers is very different than what\u2019s getting published. And that disconnect, we\u2019ve got to figure out how to solve that disconnect, I guess, is probably the best way to put it.\nGabrial Hajde: Very much appreciated. Thank you and good luck.\nTom Hassfurther: Thank you.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you. Any other questions, Jamie?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Charlie Muir-Sands from BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY). Please go ahead with your question.\nCharlie Muir-Sands: Hi, Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you very much for all the good answers so far given us a lot to think about. Just had one question on the Jackson mill. You\u2019ve obviously very helpfully quantified the temporary cost drag that we should expect in Q1 and Q2. But can you just talk about the cost benefit that we should see from the mill once it fully ramps up and perhaps contextualize how much more efficient this mill is compared with the rest of your network?\nMark Kowlzan: Yes. We talked about this for the last couple of years and that when we were done with all of this work because the work that\u2019s going on that will start next month and then finish up. It\u2019s about a 58-day outage at the mill, but it involves more than just the paper machine. Once again, in and of itself is a lot of work with dryer cans real press section rebuild, but it\u2019s also power plant work. We\u2019re going to be reconfiguring a lot of the power plant steam flows, steam pressures will be \u2013 ultimately, we\u2019ll be producing more megawatts off the power plant in the back end of the mill and providing more high pressure, higher efficient steam into the paper machine. And so net-net, the mill when it\u2019s done, will have the capability to produce linerboard and be at or amongst our lowest cost in the system. So if you think about Valdosta, DeRidder and Counce, Jackson should be as good or better, quite frankly, than Counce and DeRidder. And probably get Valdosta run for its money. And so the huge opportunity is in the, in the cost savings as we go forward, that will flow through in the future. Bob, do you want to add to that?\nBob Mundy: Yes, Charlie. And what Mark is describing, if you sort of quantify that, we\u2019re looking somewhere between $35, $40 a ton once all that work is completed, and that machine is fully operational.\nCharlie Muir-Sands: Many Thanks.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you. Any other questions, please?\nOperator: And we have an additional question from Richard Bourke from Bloomberg Intelligence. Please go ahead with your question.\nRichard Bourke: Thank you for taking the time to answer my question, gentlemen. I was just wondering with your announced price increase, to be effective January 1, if you maybe saw some demand get pulled forward into the fourth quarter by customers attempting to get that price increase?\nTom Hassfurther: No, we did not see that, Richard.\nRichard Bourke: Okay. Thank you.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you. Any other follow-up questions, Jamie?\nOperator: And sir at this time, I\u2019m showing no additional questions.\nMark Kowlzan: All right. Why don\u2019t we go ahead and conclude this. If there are no questions, I\u2019d like to thank everybody for joining us on the call, and we look forward to talking with you in April. Thank you. Everybody, have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, with that, we\u2019ll conclude today\u2019s conference call and presentation. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor. For more information see our T&C."

With today's earnings calls, Todd will provide summary comments before turning the call over to Oliver and Pat for further details. Let me now turn the call over to Todd Kelsey. Todd?\nTodd Kelsey: Thank you, Shawn. Good morning everyone. Please advance to Slide 3. There were many positives during our fiscal first quarter. These included strong quarterly wins across our market sectors, totaling $261 million, including the addition of two new exciting healthcare life sciences logos. Robust expansion of our funnel of qualified manufacturing opportunities, which now exceeds $4 billion. When combined with a total available market exceeding $240 billion, this supports our expectation of continued industry leading revenue growth with a targeted CAGR of 9% to 12%. Ongoing advancement of our sustainable and responsible business practices, along with numerous efforts by our team members to help create a better world and positively impact our communities. Yet the quarter had its challenges, primarily associated with further demand softening in the Healthcare/Life Sciences sector and certain subsectors of the industrial market. The resulting revenue decline has created inefficiencies across our organization, which we are addressing as we remain focused on delivering 5.5% GAAP operating margin in fiscal 2025. These actions will be discussed in more detail later in the call. Please advance to Slide 4 for a review of our fiscal first quarter results. We delivered fiscal first quarter revenue of $983 million, GAAP operating margin of 4.6%, including 54 basis points of stock-based compensation expense, and GAAP EPS of $1.04, including $0.19 of stock-based compensation expense. These results met the updated guidance provided on January 16, 2024 and reflected the impact of significant negative operating leverage as demand weakened late during the fiscal first quarter, limiting our ability to appropriately adjust expenses. Please advance to Slide 5. Our go-to-market organization is leveraging the current environment to create significant opportunity for future growth. We won 30 new manufacturing programs worth $261 million annually when fully ramped into production, led by continued strength from our Healthcare/Life Sciences market sector as well as strong performance from our Industrial market sector. Concurrently, we expanded our funnel of qualified manufacturing opportunities by more than $300 million versus the prior quarter to greater than $4 billion. The funnel increase was highlighted by a large expansion and opportunities in our Aerospace and Defense and Healthcare/Life Sciences market sectors. Our Aerospace and Defense funnel is at an all-time high positioning us for continued strong growth in the sector. Please advance to Slide 6. I'm proud of how our Plexus team continues to innovate and operate to advance our sustainable and responsible business practices. During the quarter, Plexus joined the U.N. Global Compact, a voluntary leadership platform for the development, implementation and disclosure of socially responsible business practices. Further, we set fiscal 2024 sustainability goals, including an additional 5% energy intensity reduction globally as well as 5% waste intensity reduction. I'd also like to highlight some well-deserved recognition for our team members as they create a better Plexus and a better world positively impacting our communities. The Malaysia chapter of HR Asia selected Plexus as one of the best companies to work for in Asia for a remarkable third time. In addition, they presented Plexus the HR Asia Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Award. Plexus was selected by the Fox Cities Chamber of Commerce in Wisconsin as the 2023 Large Company of the Year. Our Neenah operations site hosted more than 80 high schoolers in support of a Smart Girls Rock event that connected mentors from a variety of STEM-related careers, inspiring these students to pursue a career in STEM. And finally, Insight Magazine named Pat Jermain, Wisconsin Public Company CFO of the Year for 2023. Pat, congratulations and thank you for your leadership and commitment to fostering the growth and development of our company and our team. Please advance to Slide 7. For the fiscal second quarter, we continue to see healthy commercial aerospace orders, inclusive of unfulfilled customer demand, slowly rebounding semiconductor capital equipment demand aided by share gains and an ongoing tailwind from new industrial program ramps. However, the near-term demand weakness and inventory corrections from the Healthcare/Life Sciences market sector and certain sub-sectors of the industrial market our greater than previously anticipated, creating numerous inefficiencies across our business. While the move to outsourcing continues as highlighted by our robust funnel of qualified manufacturing opportunities, we are seeing some slowness in customer decision making on new product development projects, particularly in the Healthcare/Life Sciences market sector, which is creating challenges for our engineering team. As a result, we are guiding fiscal second quarter revenue of $930 million to $970 million. Non-GAAP operating margin of 4.0% to 4.4%, inclusive of approximately 72 basis points of stock-based compensation expense, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.80 to $0.95 inclusive of $0.25 of stock-based compensation expense. Our GAAP EPS guidance of $0.48 to $0.63, also includes approximately $10 million or $0.32 of restructuring charges. We expect to complete the associated restructuring actions by our fiscal third quarter and believe they will result in approximately $20 million of annualized cost savings. While we anticipate some cost leverage and margin benefit from these actions during the fiscal second quarter, typical seasonal cost headwinds and other investments, which Pat will discuss later in the call, coupled with our lower revenue forecast will more than offset the immediate benefit. While I continue to challenge our team to deliver $5 billion in annual revenue with 5.5% GAAP operating margin by our fiscal 2025. The path to $5 billion in that timeframe has become more challenging, given current market dynamics. As a result, we are implementing several strategic actions, leading to the restructuring charge to enable better scalability, create greater efficiency and align our cost structure to position Plexus for future investments and long-term growth. We are rightsizing in areas where we have excess capacity, which includes personnel reductions. While these actions are necessary to position Plexus for future success, they are incredibly difficult for all of us, given the personal effect to our valued Plexus team members. In addition, we are actively managing discretionary spending, including implementing a temporary salary reduction for our executive leadership team. We understand that, we cannot control the demand environment, but we can ensure that, we continue to evolve in order to deliver great operational efficiency, supporting the industry-leading returns that our shareholders value and expect. We anticipate the second quarter of fiscal 2024 will represent a revenue trough and are expecting sequential revenue growth with our operating margin expansion of 30 to 50 basis points, during each of the fiscal third and fourth quarters. We expect to deliver operating improvements resulting from the restructuring actions, increased manufacturing revenue and improved utilization within engineering and remain committed to delivering 5.5% GAAP operating margin in fiscal 2025. Please advance to Slide 8. Finally, as we look forward, I remain confident that Plexus will deliver then exceed $5 billion in annual revenue, while also achieving superior returns for our shareholders. We see tremendous runway for continued organic growth in excess of the industry without any substantial shifts to our target market sectors or strategy. Even with some of our markets still recovering post-COVID, we grew revenue at an approximately 8% CAGR during the last five fiscal years ended to 2023. This performance is 25 basis points in excess of the industry and in many cases more than 2x or 3x the growth rate of our competitors. As detailed on this slide, our market sector leaders estimate there is a greater than $420 billion total addressable market that is directly aligned to the customers and products that fit our strategy and our mission to be the leader in markets featuring highly complex products in demanding regulatory environments. This addressable market is approximately 40% outsourced today, creating a $240 billion opportunity in future outsourcing for Plexus, supporting our 9% to 12% revenue CAGR goal. As an organization, we continue to evolve in order to sustain our success. We are focused on driving efficiencies and creating scale, while accelerating the pace of change. Our talented Plexus team is at the heart of our strategy creating trust with our customers, while delivering customer service excellence and exceptional results. We continue to advance our operations to ensure our organic revenue growth remains well in excess of our peers, in line with our 9% to 12% goal, and that we push to deliver at least 5.5% GAAP operating margin, more consistent and greater free cash generation in the industry leading returns that our shareholders value and expect. I will now turn the call over to Oliver for additional analysis of the performance of our market sectors. Oliver?\nOliver Mihm: Thank you, Todd. Good morning. I will begin with a review of the fiscal first quarter performance of each of our market sectors, our expectations for each sector for the fiscal second quarter and some directional sector commentary for fiscal 2024. I will also review the annualized revenue contribution of our wins performance for each market sector in the region, and then provide an overview of our funnel of qualified manufacturing opportunities. Starting with the industrial sector on Slide 9, revenue increased 4% sequentially in the fiscal first quarter. This result was below our expectation of a high-single-digit increase. Softer end market demand across some market sub-sectors contributed to the weaker result. As we start the fiscal second quarter, we are experiencing forecast lightness as customers burned down inventory, most notably within the communications sub-sector offset in part by strength in green energy and an incremental increase in SemiCap. This will result in a low-single-digit decline for the industrial sector for the fiscal second quarter. Industrial market sector had strong wins in the fiscal first quarter of $125 million. Wins were balanced across our sub-sectors including SemiCap. New programs include a follow on commercial vehicle charging platform that will be produced in our Appleton, Wisconsin facility. We also expanded our portfolio with the newer SemiCap customer to include engagement from the Americas region with a complex mechanical assembly that will be produced in our Guadalajara, Mexico campus, we are now engaged with this customer from all three of our regions. One additional highlight from the quarter is an assessment that our engineering team is performing on a product that our customer is currently designing, called a lifecycle assessment, these high value add engagements examine and measure the environmental impact of a product throughout its lifecycle. By identifying improvement opportunities early and then helping to solution them, Plexus is able to partner with our customers to create products that build a better world. Looking ahead, we anticipate mid-single-digit revenue growth for our industrial market sector for our fiscal 2024, a result of a continued gradual rebound in SemiCap demand, a tailwind from our support of green energy markets, offset by a greater-than-forecast headwind from a technology transition within the communications market. Please advance to Slide 10. Revenue in our Healthcare/Life Sciences sector was down 15% sequentially for the fiscal first quarter, which was below our expectation of a low-double-digit decrease. Market weakness, inventory corrections, customer design modifications and supplier issues drove the decline. In the near-term, we see soft demand as our customers continue to decrease inventory levels. The net result is that, we anticipate our Healthcare/Life Sciences sector to see a mid-single-digit decrease for the fiscal second quarter. Healthcare/Life Sciences sector wins for the fiscal first quarter totaled $113 million and marked the fourth consecutive quarterly increase. This is also the strongest quarter of wins since the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Our wins included programs with two new customers. We have been awarded the production of a drug delivery device and an aesthetic laser-therapy system. Both products will be produced in our Penang, Malaysia campus. Our fiscal first quarter wins also included a competitive market share gain, due to the exceptional operational performance of our team in Oradea, Romania. Looking at the Healthcare/Life Sciences market sector for fiscal 2024 with some inventory corrections lingering into our second fiscal half and the approximately 5 percentages point growth headwind from the year-over-year reduction of components procured at above historical market prices, we anticipate year-over-year revenue decline in the teens. Advancing to Slide 11, our Aerospace and Defense sector increased 6% sequentially in the fiscal first quarter, strengthening modestly and meeting our expectation of a mid-single-digit increase. While unfulfilled customer demand remains, our supply chain team continues to improve component deliveries to support robust underlying commercial aerospace demand. As we look to the fiscal second quarter, temporary declines due to new customer program ramp delays in defense and space are partially offset by continued robustness within commercial aerospace. As a result, we expect a low-single-digit decline for the Aerospace and Defense sector. Our fiscal first quarter wins for the Aerospace and Defense sector were $23 million. We won two strategic defense programs with the current customer, both of which will be produced in our Boise, Idaho facility. We also won an unmanned aerial program that will be produced in our Penang, Malaysia campus. Lastly, our Neenah, Wisconsin facility won a program that reflects the continuation of multiple awards over the past year for design validation and production work related to its space program, including systems for power management, control and guidance. For fiscal 2024, Aerospace and Defense demand remains generally robust and is supported by an ongoing backlog. As a result, we expect revenue growth for fiscal 2024 exceeding the high-teens growth witnessed in fiscal 2023. Advancing to Slide 12, we can review the regional highlights of the manufacturing wins for the Fiscal first quarter. The Americas wins were robust at $139 million and included the second consecutive quarter with a substantial win from a newer top 10 medical OEM for our Guadalajara, Mexico campus. The APAC region's first fiscal quarter wins at $86 million reflected a marked increase in contribution from the Healthcare/Life Sciences sector with over half of the region's wins from that sector. The region also continued trend of strong wins performance from the industrial sector, including meaningful wins from two of our existing SemiCap customers. The EMEA region's wins first quarter wins of $36 million adds to the $280 million of wins from fiscal 2023, supporting the region's continued robust revenue growth outlook and improved profitability forecast. Please advance to Slide 13, for a review of our funnel of qualified manufacturing opportunities. Despite the strong wins performance, the total funnel increased over $4 billion as all regions saw meaningful increases in their funnel. This $4 billion result is our second largest reported funnel. Given the strength of their wins performance, the industrial sector funnel dipped slightly to $914 million. Aligned with our sector strategy, the opportunities reflected in our funnel are balanced across a variety of markets. Additions to the funnel from both customers and targets in our SemiCap sub-sector helped to backfill the wins. The Healthcare/Life Sciences sector funnel saw a sizable increase to $2.2 billion more than offsetting the impact of this quarter's strong wins performance. The strength of wins and the increasing funnel of qualified manufacturing opportunities provide optimism for future growth within the Healthcare/Life Sciences sector. The Aerospace and Defense sector grew the funnel to a record high of $923 million, nearly doubling the funnel from Q1 F\u201923. This is supported in part by growth with new targets in addition to growth of opportunities from our current customers. Lastly, the funnel of opportunities for our engineering services saw increases across all market sectors and hit a record high. While there has been delayed decision-making, particularly with our engineering customers in the Healthcare/Life Sciences sector, the funnel strength furthers our optimism for future growth and significantly improved performance. I will now turn the call to Pat for an in-depth review of our financial performance. Pat?\nPat Jermain: Thank you, Oliver, and good morning, everyone. Our fiscal first quarter results, I summarized on Slide 14. With revenue below our original guidance, gross margin of 9% came in slightly lower than expected. Reduced fixed cost leverage and unfavorable mix led to the gross margin result. Selling and administrative expense of $43 million was within our guidance range. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A was 4.4%, which was slightly above expectations given the late quarter decline in demand. GAAP operating margin of 4.6% was below our original guidance due to the loss of leverage within gross margin and SG&A expenses. Non-operating expenses of $10.3 million were consistent with expectations. GAAP diluted EPS of $1.04 was below the original guidance due to the factors previously mentioned along with a slightly unfavorable tax rate. While we continue to measure our performance against GAAP metrics, next quarter we will begin sharing non-GAAP operating margin and EPS exclusive of stock-based compensation expense for easier comparability to peers. Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet on Slide 15. We used $3 million of cash to support our operations and spent $29 million on capital expenditures, resulting in negative free cash flow of $32 million for the fiscal Q1. This result was favorable to initial expectations as we intentionally delayed a portion of capital spending to more evenly spread-out cash payments throughout fiscal 2024. With the fiscal first quarter typically requiring investments within operations, we did not repurchase any of our stock under the existing authorization. However, as announced last week, our Board approved a new $50 million share repurchase authorization, bringing the total available amount to approximately $56 million. Starting next week, we plan to begin purchasing shares under these authorizations, while taking market conditions into consideration. We plan to fund investments in operations and share repurchases with our strong and liquid balance sheet. We ended the fiscal first quarter with a cash balance of $232 million and total debt of $443 million. We had $257 million available to borrow under our credit facility and a conservative gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio of less than 1.7x. For the fiscal first quarter, we delivered return on invested capital of 10.3%, which was 210 basis points above our weighted-average cost of capital. Cash cycle ended the fiscal first quarter at 95 days, sequentially higher by eight days. Please turn to Slide 16 for details on our cash cycle. The majority of the cash cycle increase came from inventory days primarily due to lower revenue. While days increased by seven, gross inventory dollars were only modestly higher by $13 million compared to the prior quarter and were favorable to expectations. We continue to be encouraged by the work our supply chain and regional teams are doing to drive reduction in inventory, while facing challenges with customer forecast reductions in a still constrained component environment. As Todd has already provided the revenue and EPS guidance for the fiscal second quarter, I will review some additional details which are summarized on Slide 17. Fiscal second quarter gross margin is expected to be in the range of 8.8% to 9.2%. At the midpoint, gross margin would be consistent with for first quarter. This quarter gross margin will be burdened approximately 60 basis points by seasonal compensation cost increases and the reset of payroll taxes for U.S. employees. We plan to earn through this margin headwind with productivity improvements across all three of our manufacturing regions along with a portion of savings recognized from our restructuring efforts. We expect selling and administrative expenses in the range of $46.5 million to $47.5 million, which represents a modest increase year-over-year. Sequentially, SG&A is higher primarily due to the seasonal compensation headwinds and investments in essential IT solutions to support our business. Non-operating expenses are anticipated to be in the range of $10.5 million to $11 million fairly consistent with fiscal first quarter. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for both the fiscal second quarter and fiscal year is expected to be in the range of 15% to 17%. Our expectation for the balance sheet is that, working capital investments will increase slightly compared to the fiscal first quarter. Based on our revenue forecast, we expect this level of working capital will result in cash cycle days in the range of 99 to 103 days. At the midpoint, this would be sequentially higher by six days, primarily due to inventory requirements and anticipated advanced payments returning to customers. With modest working capital investments coupled with our restructuring activities and higher capital spending to support anticipated future revenue growth, we expect the usage of cash for the fiscal second quarter. A few comments on the full year. We have reduced our expected capital spending by $10 million to now be in the range of $100 million to $120 million. We are projecting slightly higher working capital investments compared to the prior year to fund growth expectations in the second half of fiscal 2024. With this said, we believe both gross inventory and advanced payments from customers will be at levels lower than the past two fiscal year ends. Also, we expect to deliver improved free cash flow as we move through fiscal 2024 ending the year with up to $50 million. With that, Livia, let's now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question coming from the line of David Williams with The Benchmark Company.\nDavid Williams: So a lot to get through here, but just I guess firstly, if you kind of think about the softness in the Industrial segment, which isn't really surprising. But can you kind of give us a sense of how your customers' tone has been and kind of partially maybe the inventory versus the demand side and how much of this is the burn down versus just more cautious outlook in the future quarters?\nTodd Kelsey: Yes. So, I think I will start David and talk a bit about our different markets and what we're seeing and then pass it off to the rest of the team to talk about inventory as it relates to demand. It's really interesting our markets. There's a bit of, I would call it a rolling progression across our markets post pandemic and stimulus as to when they've shown strength and when they've shown weakness. And so it varies a lot by sector. So, if you look at Aerospace and Defense, which I'd say is the furthest along, had lots of struggles post pandemic is very much in a boom cycle right now and performing incredibly well. As Oliver had mentioned, we're coming off a high-teens growth year and we expect to do better than that in fiscal '24. So, it's really strong growth supported by a strong funnel. If you transition over to industrial, there's a couple of different spaces within industrial that need to be considered, the first being SemiCap. And of course, we saw SemiCap drop precipitously a little over a year ago. It's hit the bottom in our Q4 of fiscal '23 and is on -- I would call it a climb upwards, although very modest at this point and a lot of it driven by share gain. So, we're seeing growth there, but some of the other markets in industrial are struggling right now, particularly the communications. And that's where we're seeing the biggest near-term headwind. Now we believe that to be a transitory situation as new technology is worked into the market. And then finally, there's Healthcare/Life Sciences. And I'd say again, we view this as transitory too, but we must say the down cycle has been a lot and that's right in the down cycle. Now, we would have to say that's a lot deeper than we've historically witnessed within our Healthcare/Life Sciences space. And there's a few reasons why that's occurring, one is that the inventory corrections as certain device making OEMs have overshot their demand. There is also the impact of components that were purchased last year at above market prices that are back to more normalized levels this year, that's having an impact as well. Also some delays in program ramps, as a result of customer design issues or supply chain, supplier issues, I would say on those components. It's very different by market, but right now, because of the near-term impact in both healthcare and communications that's having an outsized impact on our business. I will pass it over to\u2026\nOliver Mihm: Sure. I mean specific to the industrial sector, because I think that's where we started, right? We do see some general inventory burden down. But as Todd noted, it's really focused on the communications sub-sector and as we look across the rest of that sector, there is I think I'd say signs for optimism. I think we see some incremental improvement here ahead of us in test and measurement. We have got some nice tailwind in green energy, although admittedly that's coming off of a smaller base, but that provides a bit of a tailwind. And then Todd also mentioned our SemiCap sub-sector. One additional data point I will note there is, if we look at our F'24 outlook for SemiCap, that held flat quarter-over-quarter. So I think another data point that suggests signs for optimism in that sub-sector.\nDavid Williams: Great. Thanks for the color there. And then maybe secondly on the restructuring and you think about some of the reductions that you are making. How do you think about that in terms of the second half rebound? And just maybe, if you could walk through some of the changes or the restructurings that you are making, where those are and what we should expect in terms of demand, excuse me, of impact to the your capabilities? Thank you.\nTodd Kelsey: I mean, I want to start David by saying that, we don't take actions like this lightly, given the impact on our team members and the communities that we are a part of. But we do have and we have talked about having a playbook to protect our profitability. So we want to ensure that we are positioning ourselves for this 5.5% GAAP operating margin target that we have and we believe that's what we are doing. So what we're doing is, we are taking a look at areas where we can enable better scalability, create greater efficiencies, align our cost structures to position us for future investments. So that primarily involved, I'd call it, rightsizing capacity and mostly across our operations, it hit manufacturing, services and engineering. We talked about engineering being light due to healthcare, that's having a pretty substantial drag on our operating margin performance, given the ratio of cost the essence that, the cost within engineering is relatively fixed. So we think we are putting in place opportunities to better position our company for the future as we go forward on this. When we talked about, what it does to the second half and the second half rebound, as I mentioned in the prepared scripts, we look at it as being about a $20 million annualized cost savings or about $5 million per quarter. So you can think of it as, once we get these fully implemented and moving forward somewhere in the order of 50 basis point impact.\nOperator: Our next question coming from the line of Melissa Fairbanks with Raymond James.\nMelissa Fairbanks: First of all, I just wanted to say, thanks for giving us a framework for the full year revenue -- segment revenue its super helpful. So, to start, I've got a quick one for Oliver. I pretty much ask the same question every quarter. Could we get an update on the lead times? Last quarter, I think you noted even though lead times were coming down, they were still running at about twice the normal range. Have we gotten any closer to normalization there?\nOliver Mihm: Yes. Thanks, Melissa. Happy to answer that. So, similar to the message from last quarter, commodities are broadly showing stability. I think when we talked about this last quarter, we said that as you noted just over six months, we've moved from essentially 23 weeks to 22 weeks across our broader commodity base, so just an incremental improvement there. As I reflect on the whole dynamic for us, I'll say that our shortages and the challenge spots are less semiconductor focused. So, a couple of quarters ago that was really just in the semiconductor slice of our supply chain and now includes an element of passes as well. So, that I view that as a further step towards normalization. Within semiconductor, we came from 200 days down to 188 days. So, just running a bit over six months. And then within semiconductor, as we've talked about historically, still see and high-end semiconductor with lagging edge technology, we still see tight inventory and the occasional unexpected de commit and then generally no stock on the open market to help address that.\nMelissa Fairbanks: So, I just wanted to follow-up on the last question, about the restructuring actions you're taking. Maybe a little bit less delicately. So, Todd, I think you explained that there's some consolidation or optimization across from your facilities. Is there a factor or is there business you expected to win and had capacity dedicated to it, but now maybe that's no longer an opportunity so you're resizing some of those businesses?\nTodd Kelsey: No, there's really none of that Melissa. It's really more of a softening in markets that we're seeing. No, as we talked about in engineering, we're seeing some delays in decision-making and such, which is causing us to pause there. But when we look at manufacturing or services, it's just general market softening and it really relates primarily to our Healthcare/Life Sciences market sector.\nOperator: And our next question coming from the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel.\nMatt Sheerin: Just a few questions from me. One, just in terms of top-line and your expectations for sequential growth in the subsequent quarters in the back half of '24. I guess the question is, has your visibility improved or confidence improved given that looking at the last six quarters or so. I think there's at least three quarters where, there had been top-line issues or headwinds in the quarter for various reasons, right? So, I guess the question is, has that confidence or visibility improved and how?\nTodd Kelsey: Yes. So, Steve is going to take this question Matt.\nSteve Frisch: I think as Todd talked about in terms of kind of seeing these rolling changes coming through the different sectors, I think it kind of follows that same philosophy where our confidence in the future forecast, it really kind of varies a bit by sector and sub-sector. So specifically like Aerospace and Defense, much more confident in what we're seeing from the Aerospace and Defense customers in terms of what their demand looks like as well as our confidence in supply chain. So as Oliver kind of gave a little bit of guidance there, I'd say, we have more comfort level there. And we see, as Todd highlighted in the industrial sector, stabilization in the SemiCap market. As we are starting to talk to customers about their back half 2024 forecasted into 2025, gaining confidence that those things will come to reality and basically working with them to make sure we can achieve that. A little bit of volatility like the communication sector, Todd talked about. We have seen a few surprises there, but more focused on technology changes and a little bit of shift there. Obviously, going through this Healthcare/Life Sciences challenge now again ultimate long-term look very confident. If you look at where the wins are at in the funnel, which is indicative of our customers are really kind of trying to reevaluate, what their sourcing strategies are. We did have a few customers come out and announce their plans to close facilities and consolidate for us. That's a good thing. We talked about our funnel increasing. Those larger increases are coming from opportunities like that. So there may be a little bit of volatility here in this quarter in terms of where we are seeing those forecast, but as we look to the future, we expect those inventory corrections kind of burn through real potential for those sub-sectors to take off.\nMatt Sheerin: Steve, in terms of that inventory burn at customers in those sectors you discussed, are you getting, do you have a sense from customers or how long that's going to take? And in terms of like forward orders, are you seeing signs, I don't know it's 8 to 12 weeks out that things are improving?\nSteve Frisch: Yes. We are looking at it customer-by-customer and actually product-by-product and it does vary. Some products for example the things that supported COVID, some of the laboratory test equipment. Their inventory levels are a bit higher and will take a little bit longer to burn through. Other things more related to surgical platforms or other related elective procedures. We are feeling more confident those will rebound more quickly. We are going through the analysis kind of product-by-product and it does vary a bit. But again our confidence level, it will come back. It's not really a product issue, it's just really more of an inventory problem.\nTodd Kelsey: One of the things I'd add to Mike or Matt is, when we look at the at our outlook and outlook for the back half of the year, and we are taking it from a very conservative point of view, but we have a number of program ramps that are well underway that are going to continue to provide additional revenue in the back half of the year. We have got the supply chain improvement that Oliver talked about and that leads right into the unfulfilled demand that we still have out there. So looking at this conservatively, we have confidence that, we are going to see the sequential improvement that I talked about. One other revenue component -- related component that I just want to hit on quickly, as I want to correct a statement that I made in the prepared remarks. And when I talked about our growth rate, I talked about us having an 8% CAGR over our last five fiscal years, which is accurate, but that is a 250 basis point spread above the industry average, so not the '25 that I had mentioned earlier.\nMatt Sheerin: Just on the communication side, could you remind us, like what the sub-sectors or industries, because I know you don't play in mobile networks or base stations anymore, right? It's mostly in other areas.\nTodd Kelsey: Yes. It's really broad brand infrastructure that we are talking about there, Matt.\nMatt Sheerin: And that weakness are you seeing across, your vendor base or customer base?\nOliver Mihm: Yes. I will note that, we are well-represented in that technology space. And so as there is an expected technology upgrade here in the future and so when that does manifest, we're going to enjoy the growth as part of that.\nMatt Sheerin: And just a couple of quick questions for Pat, if I can. One, Pat, in terms of your expectations for margin expansion in the back half of '24, and obviously, gross margins should expand. But in terms of SG&A, you talked about some near-term expenses, but does that go down in Q3 or because of IT costs and others, is that going to be at those elevated levels?\nPat Jermain: Yes, I think we will see improvement in the percentage as we get to the back half of the year. The dollars, I think we'll stay relatively consistent, Matt. So, from a percentage standpoint, what I'm guiding Q2 at is about 4.9% of revenue and that is up from Q1. There's really three main components to that. The seasonal compensation cost increases is about $1.5 million. We have got some higher stock-based compensation based on the roll-off of some prior awards. And then as I mentioned some IT system related investments and a host of things we're doing there around collaboration tools, cyber security, upgrade to manufacturing systems. So, that's driving the dollar increase and I do think that will stay pretty consistent throughout the rest of the year. But from a percentage standpoint, where we're targeting is around 4.5% of revenue. So, some leverage improvement as we see top-line growth in the back half of the year.\nOperator: And our next question coming from the line of Anja Soderstrom with Sidoti.\nAnja Soderstrom: First of all, Pat, did you mention that you expect the CapEx to come down for the year than your prior projected?\nPat Jermain: Yes. Previously we had $110 million to $130 million. So, we brought it down $10 million and some of that's just because of growth investments that are being delayed a bit. We're being really mindful and prudent about the capital spending this year.\nAnja Soderstrom: And in terms of the funnel, have you mentioned larger opportunities there coming in? And can you talk about how they relate to previous opportunities?\nPat Jermain: Yes. So, we are still seeing a larger number of large opportunities in our funnel than we had seen historically.\nAnja Soderstrom: So, does that impose bigger risk then in case you don't win this larger opportunities?\nPat Jermain: No, I think it actually creates more opportunity for us to have strong wins performance because of that.\nShawn Harrison: It's Shawn. Just as maybe a little bit of clarification. When we go head-to-head on a program versus competitors, on average, we're winning two-thirds of the time. And so our win ratio when we go into this qualified funnel of opportunities is quite high, whether that's a small program or one of these larger programs.\nAnja Soderstrom: And also lastly, the issues that had with some airplanes lately and Boeing (NYSE:BA) having some issues. Is that any risk to you at all or?\nTodd Kelsey: Yes. So, the answer from a risk standpoint is no. We do supply Boeing and we have, I would call it a reasonable, we don't supply Boeing directly, but we do supply into Boeing and we do have content on the 737 and the 737 MAX. But \u2013 and I saw today that, the FAA announced that they're going to allow Boeing to go back into production at the rate that they have been at historically, so that would have minimal impact to us. But even if production had been shut down, it'd be of, I'd call it, a negligible impact to our overall revenue. So it's pretty insignificant to us.\nAnja Soderstrom: Thank you. You also mentioned, communication seems to be a headwind for you now. But what are you hearing there in terms of the tone and when that could potentially come back?\nPat Jermain: Yes. I will offer this, as we went into a quarter ago, we thought that that technology upgrade and the bounce back there was going to be early to mid '24. So we are now taking a more conservative view as it being a little bit further out, but the exact timeframe, I hesitate to call the ball for that.\nOperator: Our next question coming from the line of Jim Ricchiuti with Needham and Company.\nJim Ricchiuti: Just wanted to go back to some of the commentary on the market sectors. If we look at where their biggest wildcards are in terms of the improvement that you are anticipating in the fiscal second half. Would you say, it's more on the Healthcare/Life Science portion of the business?\nTodd Kelsey: I would say, Jim, we are not looking at the markets improving to get the recovery or the growth in revenue that we're projecting. It's more based off of program ramps and activity that's already underway. So any market improvement, whether that come from healthcare or further increase in SemiCap demand would be upside to what our projections are.\nJim Ricchiuti: And I guess, Todd, the way of thinking about it is, if there is some potential for negative surprises, where you don't necessarily see progress overall in the second half. Which sector might carry the biggest risk? That's why I was asking the question.\nTodd Kelsey: I mean, it would probably have to think about industrial as further degradation of healthcare, but it seems that, that's come down a pretty tremendous amount already that, it should be at a bottom are close to it.\nJim Ricchiuti: On the A&D side, seemed to be suggesting that, even with there's been a little bit of it sounds like some program activity slipping on the defense space side, you still seem pretty confident that, that shows healthy growth for the year as a whole, with the continued growth that you are seeing in commercial air. Is that fair to say?\nOliver Mihm: That is fair to say. Specifically to hit that defense and space headwinds that I mentioned that we are experiencing in Q2, that is a short-term headwind, so that's nothing systemic that we are talking about there. As an example, with one of the program ramps we are doing is actually a bit of a good story here. We were doing printed circuit board assemblies for a customer and we are performing so well on the ramp and say, ''We want you to do the whole higher level assembly. And so we took a pause where we could take over the rest of that business as well''. So temporary headwinds and we do not expect that to persist. Then, as we talked about previously, strong underlying commercial aerospace demand.\nPat Jermain: One of the things too I'd add, Jim, on our Aerospace and Defense sector, we break it down into four subsectors, Aerospace, Defense, Commercial Space and Security. And all of them are showing reasonable year-over-year growth in fiscal 2024.\nJim Ricchiuti: And then finally, you talk about the 5.5% GAAP operating margin in fiscal '25 and that you're committed to protecting that. Does that require if we see in the past, you've talked about $5 billion of revenue? It sounds like you're suggesting, you get to those targets even with the restructuring and the cost actions you're doing, even if revenues are not at that level, is that, or am I misinterpreting what you said?\nPat Jermain: No, I don't think you are, Jim. I mean, what we'd like to get to the $5 billion in revenue, but obviously with current dynamics and the current results and guide that would take a pretty substantial market improvement to be able to do that. But we can control the operating performance and the operating margin. That's part of the reason for us looking at the restructuring actions as well as some other activities is we believe that that's a level of performance that we need to deliver.\nJim Ricchiuti: But basically from the actions you're taking, you don't necessarily anticipate anything additional that you have to consider to get, given the current state of the businesses?\nTodd Kelsey: No, we don't believe so. I mean, obviously, we'll need to get some additional revenue growth, so we get leverage. It really comes down to the restructuring actions, better utilization within our engineering team and then some manufacturing leverage.\nOperator: And I see we have a follow-up question from David Williams from Benchmark.\nDavid Williams: First, I missed this earlier, but I want to say congratulations to Pat on the CFO of the year, it's certainly well-deserved and I think we would all agree to that. So, congratulations there.\nPat Jermain: Thanks, David.\nDavid Williams: Yes, of course. And then secondly, just want to ask real quickly on the previous unverified list addition that you guys were [indiscernible] on. Was there any impact from that and anything longer term we should think about here, any further risk or just any color around that would be helpful I think?\nTodd Kelsey: Yes. So, we've been able to recover through, I'd call it a heroic efforts from our supply chain team and our APAC team in the region. So, we don't believe there'll be any impact to our fiscal Q2, although it wasn't easy. But what I would say is that the addition to the list wasn't merited, excuse me. It reflected more of a communications issue and a delay in a routine verification of a shipment to our Xiamen facility. The quick removal from the list, which I think was probably like record speed, reflects these facts. So, I would like to call out though the Bureau of Industry and Security within the Department of Commerce and their strong partnership on this to resolve this. So, was very happy with the response that we were able to get. And I'd just like to reiterate, we have a strong compliance program and we remain committed to all laws as well as a strong partnership with the BIAF. So, nothing additional and we're happy that this is behind us.\nDavid Williams: Nice work getting that clear quickly. And then just secondly, regionally, it looks like Americas was down quite a bit. Is there anything specific maybe to that area? Is it fair to assume that maybe the more heavily-leveraged to the healthcare industry or anything maybe just around Americas that drove the sequential and year-over-year decline?\nOliver Mihm: Yes. And so I think you have already hit it there, David. I think as we look at the Americas region and the exposure relative to Healthcare/Life Sciences as well as the communication sub-sector is creating that result. And as those sectors come back, we will see the Americas region come back with that.\nOperator: We have a follow-up from Matt Sheerin with Stifel.\nMatt Sheerin: Thank you. My follow-up is on the inventory situation. Pat, you talked about the total inventory days at 161. I know, but I didn't get the percentage or the number of days backed by customer deposits. Could you give us that number? And you also mentioned you expected those deposits to come down, as customers want their cash back, given lead times are getting back to more normal? So what does that percentage look like and how does that impact your cash flows over the next few quarters, as that percentage comes down?\nPat Jermain: Matt that's a really good point, because we do have to look at it on a net basis, because I expect significant reduction in gross inventory dollars year-over-year. It could be upwards of $100 million. But we will see a significant portion of the advance payments being returned as well as we burn down that inventory. So to give you just some examples of what happened from a day\u2019s perspective, from Q4 to Q1 days of customer deposits came down too. We would expect that coming down quite a bit in the back half of this year. So when you look at it on a net-net basis, our cash cycle, we ended at 87 days in fiscal 2023. I expect improvement in '24, probably in the low-80s on a net-net basis. So much greater reduction in inventory, but also a reduction in the advance payments as well.\nMatt Sheerin: Got it. But as a percentage, do you expect those advance payments to come down?\nPat Jermain: As a percentage of gross revenue or inventory? Yes. Let me just do some...\nMatt Sheerin: Now it's what over 30%, right?\nPat Jermain: Right. It would be still probably similar to that by the end of fiscal 2024. Again our goal is to return those upon liquidating the inventory so it would probably be around that low 30% range.\nMatt Sheerin: It's not going to change. It's just the growth. The number is going to change, which is lower.\nPat Jermain: Both dollars will reduce.\nMatt Sheerin: Got it. Okay. That's it for me. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And that concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Todd Kelsey for any closing remarks.\nTodd Kelsey: All right. Thank you, Livia. I'd like to thank our shareholders, investors, analysts, as well as our Plexus team members that joined the call this morning. In closing, I want to say that, as I look forward, I remain very confident in our future. And it's our exceptional Plexus team that provides the basis for this view. They continue to differentiate Plexus in the market and with our customers where we're the leaders in the markets featuring highly complex products and demanding regulatory environments.

        "article_content": " \n\nBy Timothy Gardner\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday paused approvals for pending and future applications to export liquefied natural gas (LNG)from new projects, a move cheered by climate activists that could delay decisions on new plants until after the Nov. 5 election.\nThe Department of Energy (DOE) will conduct a review during the pause that will look at the economic and environmental impacts of projects seeking approval to export LNG to Europe and Asia where the fuel is in hot demand. \nThe review will take months and then will be open to public comment which will take more time, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told reporters in a teleconference.\nBiden said in a statement: \"During this period, we will take a hard look at the impacts of LNG exports on energy costs, America's energy security, and our environment.\"\nThe pause \"sees the climate crisis for what it is: the existential threat of our time,\" said Biden, a Democrat. \nAdministration officials vowed that the pause would not hurt allies, as it has an exemption for national security should they need more LNG.\nCompanies and countries in Europe rely on steady supplies of LNG from the U.S., which became world's top LNG exporter last year, as the region tries to wean itself off pipelined gas from Russia after its 2022 invasion of Ukraine. U.S. allies in Asia also covet LNG as they seek to slow coal consumption. \nA spokesperson for the European Commission, noting the exemption for national security emergencies, told Reuters, \"This pause will not have any short- to medium-term impacts on the EU's security of supply.\" \nKaroline Leavitt, a campaign spokesperson for former President Donald Trump, a Republican, said the decision was \"one more disastrous self-inflicted wound that will further undermine America\u2019s economic and national security.\"\nThe last review of LNG export projects was in 2018 when export capacity was 4 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd). That capacity has tripled and is set to shoot higher by 2030 with projects under construction.\nThe growth has set off protests from environmentalists and youth groups, part of Biden's base. Activists say new LNG projects can harm local communities with pollution, lock in global reliance on fossil fuels for decades, and lead to emissions from burning gas and from leaks of the powerful greenhouse gas methane.\nEnvironmentalists hailed the move and canceled sit-in protest planned at DOE headquarters next month.\n\"This is a milestone,\" said Roishetta Ozane, founder and director of The Vessel Project of Louisiana and a leading voice in the opposition to the LNG build-out, who said her family's health is affected by these terminals. \"It sets the stage for potential rejections and slows down progress of these projects.\"\nMichelle Weindling, political director of the youth-based Sunrise Movement said the pause would help Biden get support from young voters in November.\n\"It needs to be seen that leaders are leading boldly and unapologetically to solve this crisis,\" she said. \nSwaths of U.S. industry, ranging from chemicals, steel, food and agriculture, also oppose unrestricted exports of U.S. gas, saying it raises risks for fuel prices and reliability.\nOnly four projects with export approvals pending at the DOE would be affected by the pause, an administration official said without naming them. The projects could include ones by Sempra Infrastructure, Commonwealth LNG and  Energy Transfer  (NYSE:ET), the DOE's website showed. \nSempra is confident its projects would help displace more carbon-intense fossil fuels, including coal, and provide gas to allies, a spokesperson said. The other companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nLOUISIANA PROJECT CP2\nUpset with Biden's approvals last year of oil and gas projects in Alaska, climate activists have focused on stopping Venture Global's Calcasieu Pass 2 (CP2) pending LNG project in Louisiana, which would be the nation's largest. \nCP2 first needs approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which could consider it as soon as February, before its exports are considered by the DOE.\nThe DOE said the pause applies to all current and future pending applications until the review is complete. That means the pause could include projects like CP2 if approved by FERC, which only voted down an LNG project once, a move it later reversed. \n\nAn administration official said in the call that \"projects like CP2 really speak to this question of are we over-building?\"\nA Venture Global spokesperson could not be immediately reached but the person said this week that a pause could send a \"devastating signal to our allies that they can no longer rely on the United States.\" Germany accounts for nearly half of CP2's current contracted capacity of LNG. \n \n"

With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to you, Bob.\nBob Jordan: Thank you, Julia, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. As we close the books on 2023, I want to take a moment to reflect on how far we've come. And more importantly, I want to thank the people at Southwest Airlines for their dedication, their warrior spirit, their heart and ultimately, for their incredible resilience. At this time last year, we were getting back on our feet from the disruption following Winter Storm Elliott. We quickly mobilized to put immediate mitigation efforts in place, while simultaneously building a robust plan to prepare us for future extreme winter weather disruptions. We are also working to restore our network, address our staffing needs and return our aircraft to full utilization. And of course, we were in the middle of negotiations with the majority of our labor unions. I'm incredibly pleased to be on the other side of 2023 and to be able to share all the progress we made last year. We completed a comprehensive winter weather action plan, which has already been successfully tested in multiple weather, winter weather events, including the extended nationwide winter storms we experienced this month, but also with other types of disruptions such as hurricanes, severe fall in Chicago and the Maui fires. Through all of those events, our aircraft and crude networks remain stable. We recovered quickly, and we were able to minimize the impact on our customers. We also got fully staffed, restored our network and reached the full utilization of our fleet. Our network is in a healthy place, and it shows in our operational improvement. In fact, we improved in nearly every operational metric. Our completion factor performance, in particular, was fantastic at 99% for the full year, with fourth quarter being our best quarterly performance in more than a decade at 99.6%. We also made significant progress on our labor agreements, including ratification earlier this week of an agreement that secures industry-leading pay for our best-in-class pilots. We have now successfully reached ratification on nine contracts in a little over a year, demonstrating our commitment to providing competitive market compensation packages for our people. This is a huge accomplishment, and I would like to thank all those who have tirelessly supported those negotiations. Of course, all this was in addition to a host of other accomplishments, the rollout of a new revenue management system, the launch of multiple customer experience improvements and the negotiation of a very cost-effective order book with Boeing. The order book allows us to continue the modernization of our fleet and provides the opportunity to flex our growth plans up or down over the long-term. We also made rapid adjustments to capacity for both 2023 and 2024 and put in place significant network adjustments in response to changing demand patterns. These changes reduced our planned 2024 year-over-year capacity increase to roughly 6%, all of which is carryover from 2023 network restoration. So there will be no net new additional capacity in 2024 as we work to mature our route network. Moving to our performance. We continue to be very pleased with the core demand for our product. We saw close-end performance strength in November and December for both leisure and corporate travel. This led fourth quarter 2023 to be yet another record at just over $6.8 billion in operating revenue. And we are seeing that strength continue into 2024. This demand strength, combined with about $1.5 billion in incremental year-over-year pre-tax profit from our network optimization efforts and the contributions from our portfolio of strategic initiatives is driving us to expect additional revenue records and year-over-year operating margin expansion despite cost pressures from new labor agreements and increased aircraft maintenance expense. Our network changes are materially in place with the March schedule, where we expect to hit a profitability inflection point. While still early in the quarter, our initiatives are delivering towards our revenue target, and we expect to exit the quarter with a strong operating margin for the month of March. While we have significant inflationary pressures from our new labor agreements, we have initiatives underway that will begin to help counter these pressures with efficiency improvements. These include everything from scheduling techniques to digital modernization and we planned in 2024 with head count flat to down as compared with year-end 2023 as we slow hiring to levels that are at/or below our attrition rate that will drive efficiency gains in 2024 with more to come in 2025. All of this supports a solid plan with a line of sight to improve our financial returns and earn our cost of capital in 2024. While this represents notable progress, I want to be clear, earning adequate and consistent returns, ROIC well in excess of WACC is our financial North Star, and it's not negotiable. We will be relentless in executing against our plans, and we will continue to make adjustments, including capacity adjustments, if needed, until we deliver those results. Adequate and consistent return is how we have created decades of shareholder value, and it continues to be our key focus. Our current set of initiatives is tracking nicely and we'll provide you a lot more detail later this year at Investor Day. In addition, we're working on a next seven initiatives to support -- in support of sustainable returns over time. In closing, we made tremendous progress in 2023, and we finished the year a much stronger company. We will finish this year stronger again. We are fully committed to improving the customer experience, and delivering on our long-term financial targets, including generating returns for our shareholders. As always, I have confidence in our people and our business model, and I am particularly proud of our people for their dedication and their resilience. They remain our absolute greatest asset, the heart and soul of our company and the ultimate source of pride for me. And with that, I will turn it over to Tammy.\nTammy Romo: Thank you, Bob, and hello, everyone. As Bob mentioned, 2023 wasn't without challenges, but we are stronger and ready to take on another year, and that is all thanks to our incredible employees. We delivered $996 million in profits for the year and our fourth quarter net income of $233 million, both when excluding special items, was on the better side of our expectations. We prioritize the restoration of our network and operational reliability in 2023, which has taken a lot of resources and focus. With our operations now stable and the network fully restored, we can drive much more focus in energy to consistently delivering a strong financial performance, along with delivering operational excellence. We have incredible strengths to build upon and the levers we need to optimize and regain our position as an industry leader. We will be steadfast in our efforts to make meaningful progress this year in support of our long-term goal of generating consistent returns well in excess of our cost of capital. Ryan and Andrew will cover the headway we've made with our revenue and operations performance in detail. So, I'll start with our cost performance before moving to fleet and balance sheet. Overall, our unit cost excluding special items, were down 16% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter average fuel price of $3 per gallon was right at the low end of guidance, primarily due to jet fuel prices in the L.A. market steady after significantly spiking in mid-November. Thankfully, market prices dropped as we moved into this year and our fuel price guidance of $2.70 to $2.80 per gallon for the first quarter and $2.55 to $2.65 per gallon for the full year and the welcome reduction in fuel costs compared with 2023. We are currently 60% hedged here in first quarter and 57% hedged for the full year with more meaningful hedge protection kicking in at Brent prices around $90 per barrel. That's a higher strike price than where our 2023 hedges began to provide meaningful protection, which was closer to $70 per barrel. This is reflective of the current market conditions and elevated cost of hedging. We continue to prudently add to our fuel hedge position for 2026, nearing 20% hedged and are currently 46% hedged in 2025 in line with our goal to be roughly 50% hedged in each calendar year. While we are not fully immune to the volatile energy market, I am grateful that our hedging positions provide meaningful protection against catastrophic increases, while also allowing us to participate fully when market prices decline. Moving to nonfuel cost. Our fourth quarter year-over-year CASM-X decrease of 18.1% was on the favorable side of our guidance range, driven primarily by elevated operating expenses and lower capacity levels in fourth quarter 2022 as a result of the operational disruption. This was partially offset by general inflationary cost pressures, including higher labor rates for all employee work groups, as well as elevated maintenance expense. Both of which are sticky as we move into 2024. I also want to congratulate our pilots on their newly ratified contract. Obviously, the market for pilot wages has increased significantly, and it is important that we keep pace to reward our employees appropriately. As a result of the new agreement, we recorded a change in estimate for the pilot ratification bonus, and you can find the details and breakout of the accounting treatment in this morning's press release. Looking to first quarter 2024, we currently estimate our CASM-X to increase in the range of 6% to 7% year-over-year, roughly 3 to 4 points of this estimated increase is driven by higher overall 2024 labor cost and market wage rate accruals. The remainder of the first quarter CASM-X increase is primarily due to year-over-year pressure in maintenance expense, driven by rate increases as well as an increase in maintenance activity as our 800s are coming off their honeymoon period. Speaking to full year cost. Our CASM-X guidance of a 6% to 7% increase year-over-year is also essentially driven by labor and maintenance cost pressures. Roughly 4 to 5 points is attributable to labor and roughly 2 points is from maintenance for the reasons I previously covered. While we accrue for market wage rates, the recently ratified pilot contract, contributes the majority of the labor CASM-X increase this year due to a step-up in wage rates, work rule changes and enhanced benefits. As Bob mentioned, we are steadfastly focused on regaining efficiencies to help counter some of the structural cost pressures as we look to control what's controllable. We are not satisfied with our current financial performance, and we will work relentlessly until we produce the financial strength and returns you should expect from Southwest Airlines. We have a solid 2024 plan, which includes the benefit of roughly $1.5 billion in incremental year-over-year pre-tax profits from our strategic initiatives. The vast majority of the initiatives delivering value in 2024 are revenue related, contributing well over $1 billion of the $1.5 billion total expected incremental benefit. And our network optimization and market maturation efforts are providing the bulk of that revenue lift. The balance of the revenue generating benefits come from incremental managed business initiatives, primarily increased GDS participation. The incremental cost benefit relates primarily to fleet monetization and early yields from other operating efficiency efforts such as digital service modernization and our turn initiative. We will go into a lot more detail on our initiative portfolio at Investor Day later this year. While early, our plan provides significant progress towards our long-term goal to generate ROIC well in excess of our cost of capital. Again, more details to come at our 2024 Investor Day. Now turning to our fleet. During 2023, we received a total of 86-8 deliveries, more than planned and retired 39-700 to less than planned, ending the year with a total of 817 aircraft. We consistently mentioned the flexibility in our fleet modernization efforts being a key competitive advantage and the minor shifting of deliveries and retirements throughout 2023 validates our ability to thoughtfully plan and execute given the continued supply chain challenges facing Boeing. Moving into 2024, there is continued uncertainty around the timing of expected Boeing deliveries and the certification of the MAX 7 aircraft. Our fleet plans remain nimble and currently differs from our contractual order book with Boeing. We are planning for 79 aircraft deliveries this year and expect to retire roughly 45-700 and 4-800, resulting in a net expected increase of 30 aircraft this year. Taking our current plan into consideration, we expect our 2024 CapEx to be in the range of $3.5 billion to $4 billion. After finalizing our 2024 plans and refining capacity levels to better reflect the current environment, we now expect full year 2024 capacity to be up about 6% year-over-year. And our 2024 capacity plans do not currently include any MAX 7 flying. So, a certification of that aircraft continues to push out our 2024 capacity plans will not be impacted. In addition, we are also reducing our total fuel expense with our fleet modernization initiatives as we continue to bring on more fuel-efficient -8 aircraft and retire -700. We saw a nearly 3% year-over-year improvement in fuel efficiency in 2023 and expect continued improvement this year. In addition to fuel savings, our fleet modernization initiative is a key component in reaching our environmental sustainability goals. Lastly, I am proud to report that our balance sheet strength continues to be a financial backbone as we move into another year. We remain the only US airline with an investment-grade rating by all three rating agencies. We ended the year with $11.5 billion in cash and short-term investments, returned $428 million to our shareholders through dividend payments in 2023, paid $85 million to retire debt and finance lease obligations in 2023, and continue to be in a net cash position. We expect to pay a modest $29 million in debt payments this year and continue to expect interest income to well exceed our expected interest expense of $249 million in 2024. So, we are pleased to have a plan for significant financial improvement to be made this year. With some major milestones behind us, such as restoring our network, becoming fully staffed, fully utilizing our fleet and so much more, our sites are set on expanding margins and covering our cost of capital in 2024. And as I close, I'd like to sincerely thank our people for another year of hard work and dedication to the mission and vision of Southwest Airlines. I am so grateful for each and every one of you. You were truly my heroes. And with that, I will turn it over to Ryan.\nRyan Green: Thank you, Tammy, and hello everyone. Let me start by sharing that I am very pleased with the overall demand for our business, the execution from our amazing people, and the engagement of our loyal customers. Fourth quarter unit revenue finished slightly better than expectations at down 8.9% year-over-year. The improvement was driven by a strengthening of close-in revenue performance in November and December for both leisure and corporate business travel, as well as the continuation of overall strong holiday performance and market share gains from our managed business initiatives. I'm pleased to report that we saw no bookings impact from last year's operational disruption during this past holiday season, which speaks to the operational improvements we have made over the last year as well as the enduring loyalty from our customers. In addition, fourth quarter was another quarter with multiple record set, including record fourth quarter operating revenue and passenger revenue, as well as an all-time quarterly record for passengers carry. Fares also performed well in the fourth quarter, with our average passenger fare up about 2.5% year-over-year. And all-in-all, our fourth quarter operating revenues were up over $1 billion relative to fourth quarter of 2019. And while we still have work to do on our revenue performance, I remain very pleased with our progress. Looking to our full year results, we grew 2023 operating revenues nearly 10% year-over-year to a record $26 billion accompanied by record passengers, record Rapid Rewards revenue and record ancillary revenue. And speaking of records, we set operating revenue records in each quarter of the year and for the full year of 2023. As we move into 2024, we are seeing the momentum continue, and we're seeing early but highly encouraging benefits from our network optimization efforts, and we expect first quarter unit revenue growth of 2.5% to 4.5% when compared to the same period last year. This represents a solid sequential improvement in year-over-year unit revenue performance even when normalized for the five-point tailwind from the prior year disruption impact. In fact, our guide would imply first quarter 2024 nominal RASM to be about five points higher than our normal seasonal sequential average when compared with nominal fourth quarter of 2023 RASM. We currently have about 60% of expected bookings for first quarter already in place, slightly above normal, and we are seeing better than normal sequential RASM performance further demonstrating that our network optimization efforts are working. As we refined our capacity plans for this year, we've been able to pull in even more flying out of the shoulder periods, which we believe will be a tangible contributor in boosting our performance. While our forecast doesn't assume any material increase in demand for domestic air travel in 2024, we do have a line of sight to double-digit operating revenue growth year-over-year, driven largely by the network and initiative-driven revenue that Tammy detail. Included in that, of course, is our efforts to drive managed business. We are very pleased with the performance of our managed business initiatives and the success of our Southwest business team. In the past year, we had a solid increase in market share, more than three points in the managed business space and I'm very proud we improved our Business Travel News ranking from fourth place in the industry in 2019 to second place in 2023. We were the only carrier on the survey to receive an increased total score two years in a row while each of our competitors' scores have declined over that same period. It's another example of the progress we're making against the industry in the managed business space. Of course, we're also continuing our efforts to improve our customer experience and our Rapid Rewards program. We are seeing improved customer satisfaction scores with our Wi-Fi product as we proceed with our infrastructure investments there and more aircraft are joining the fleet every day within sea power and larger bins on board. We've made several enhancements to our award-winning Rapid Rewards program, including making it easier to reach our A-List and A-List Preferred levels and we will soon be rolling out the ability to book travel with a combination of cash plus Rapid Reward points later this spring. We introduced customer bag tracking to reduce friction in our customers' travel experience and we look forward to sharing more on our larger digital hospitality modernization plan in the coming months. All of this is designed to make it easier to fly with us and give customers even more reasons to choose Southwest. As we enter 2024, we have a very solid plan that leverages the unparalleled strength of our people, our product, our loyalty program and our route network, and we look forward to delivering on continued progress towards our long-term financial goals. With that, Andrew, over to you.\nAndrew Watterson: Thank you, Ryan, and hello, everyone. I'd like to start out by recognizing our people for their efforts in successfully managing through four different named winter storms, which was spread over 11 days and impacted a wide portion of our route network with intense weather conditions and frigid temperatures this month. These overlapping winter systems definitely put our winter operations fairness plan to the test. Overall, I'm very pleased with how well we manage the storms. The sheer magnitude of these weather systems resulted in significant cancellations, the vast majority of which were proactive on our part. Our cancellations were made 14 hours in advance on average and 70% were canceled with at least six hours in advance. As you can imagine, providing that much notice improves the customer experience. In fact, we have found that it can result in MPS scores that approximate, those with customers with no disruption to their itinerary. Overall cancellation rates were in line with the industry and were primarily isolated to the operations directly impacted by the storms. With fewer than 2% of our cancellations tied to crew scheduling challenges. This is a significant contrast to what we experienced with winter storm Elliott in December 2022. The improvement is directly the result of last year's winter operations investments and protocols. I echo Bob's sentiments that we are in a much better spot today than a year ago. In the past year, we not only completed the winter operations preparedness plan, we also delivered on a long list of initiatives to modernize our operation with benefits for both our customers and our employees. Our people have the staffing, equipment, tools and infrastructure to operate safely and at pace in winter weather. The good news is that, all the hard work showed up in our operating performance. We closed out 2023 with only about 1% of our total flights canceled and we improved in basically every metric. Our completion factor, on-time performance, early morning originators, turn compliance and turn differential and mishandled battery, all showed substantial year-over-year improvement, which in turn led to a year-over-year improvement in our Trip Net Promoter Score. As we enter 2024, we will focus on continuing to build on our 2023 priority of operating quality. We ranked fourth place in the 2023 Wall Street Journal Airline Quality Metrics despite several of the metrics covering the winter storm Eliot period. Our goal is to move up this ranking and ultimately be ranked number one. We will also double down on three additional priorities: bringing out operating inefficiencies increasing asset productivity and creating operating leverage by reducing structural costs. These are multiyear initiative-based efforts, which will begin yielding material benefits in 2025. We'll share more on these in the coming months. Finally, I'd like to close by congratulating our pilots on our new contract. I'd also like to thank all the negotiating teams who have worked so hard to reach nine agreements since October of 2022. These teams work tirelessly and I am pleased we can reward employees with well-deserved pay increases and quality of life enhancements. We remain in negotiations with two union represented groups, TW555 and TW556 and we look forward to reaching agreements to reward those employees for their contributions. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Julia.\nJulia Landrum: Thank you, Andrew. This completes our prepared remarks. We will now open the line for analyst questions. We would like to speak with as many of you as possible, so we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up if necessary. Please go ahead with the first question.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Good afternoon everyone. Maybe we can start with the $1.5 billion kind of initiatives. And any chance you can share more detail there, kind of details on what the different contributing items are, and also how much visibility do you have into that? Trying to get a sense of how much of that may be in the bag, so to speak?\nBob Jordan: Hey, Ravi, it's Bob. I'll start, and then maybe Ryan can jump in. Obviously, a lot of the year-over-year improvement counts on the initiatives delivering, and I feel very confident about that. I mean, some of this is our Investor Day initiatives continuing to perform. And then on top of that, you have new things, a lot of which -- the majority of which are the network improvements, which, as you know, are in place materially beginning in March and then fully in place by early summer. And so we have a lot of confidence in, though, certainly, the Investor Day initiatives delivering. And while it's early in the quarter, we have some line of sight into, obviously, March and how will the network change and optimization is delivering, and we're on track there. It's things like -- it's basically adjusting for new demand patterns. It's adjusting -- you know what they are. The Tuesday, Wednesday, shoulder flying, those kinds of things. But no, I feel like we're on track to hit that incremental $1.5 billion. Again, most of that is revenue. About two-thirds of that is revenue related. Ryan, do you want to add anything?\nRyan Green: Yes. Of the revenue initiatives there, a lot -- most of that is the network optimization and the continuing maturation of some of our development markets, development market percentage of mix continues to get more back to normal ranges by the end of 2024. So that certainly will help. And obviously, we've been able to watch those development markets mature throughout their curve here over the last few years. As it relates to the other revenue initiatives that are in place, they will continue to mature and then also provide additional benefit as we -- as the airline grows. A significant portion of that is the managed business initiatives that we've been talking about. And I'm very confident in how that those sets of initiatives continue to perform. We're definitely on track. Managed business got better in the fourth quarter from how it was performing in the third quarter, and then we're expecting another sequential improvement here in the first quarter with managed business. We can see that in place and how bookings are coming in, in January, and as we begin to get into the February booking curve here. So yes, everything that we can see, how we finished the fourth quarter and then what we can see here in the first quarter and going forward makes me very confident.\nRavi Shanker: Very helpful. And maybe as a quick follow-up. I'd love to get your thoughts on the apparent premiumization of the domestic product. Obviously, you guys are committed to a single cabin, but does that give you kind of more room to raise RASM across the product or kind of just what your response to that be?\nRyan Green: Well, premium certainly is a hot topic in the industry, and it's something that we watch -- that we're watching closely. We also talk to our customers on a regular basis. This is one of the things that we continue to get their feedback on. And I think we talked about it some on the last call. As you think about premium, historically in the industry, premium revenue has been highly cyclical. This is one of those times where carriers are adding premium seats into the cabin. But when the economic cycle shifts, they're pulling seats, premium seats out of the cabin. And so as we see kind of the recovery here from the pandemic, we'll have to see how these trends persist and go forward. I think overall RASM, obviously, we follow that and how we compare relative to the industry, and we're working on working on improving that as we go forward here. I will say that ancillary revenue, the majority of which is boarding products, our early bird product as well as our upgraded boarding product is doing very well. We're having record ancillary revenue performance. And so I think, yes, we have a single cabin, but we're able to improve RASM and grow ancillary revenue through some of those boarding products as well.\nRavi Shanker: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJamie Baker: Hey good morning everybody. Obviously, a launch of discussion about domestic capacity -- woah, sorry, I'm still there, right?\nRyan Green: You're there.\nJamie Baker: Yes. Sorry about that. It was probably the Temis expletive that I've ever said. Lots of discussion about domestic capacity cuts, your own and others. Just curious, though, in markets where you overlap with lower-cost competitors, have you seen any changes in how they're competing other than just the capacity cuts. I mean there's been speculation of lower OA pricing as some of those airlines try to regain profitability. I'm not seeing any of that, but it's that sort of thing that I'm asking you about.\nBob Jordan: Yes, Jamie, obviously, there are -- I mean, there are probably as many moving parts right now as I've ever seen. You've got -- as Ryan talked about, you've got a focus on parts of the cabin that are outperforming our route network that are outperforming, you've got -- you've got a lot of capacity moving around in the industry right now. You've got mergers. So it's tough to tell that -- and on top of that, obviously, you've got capacity impacts due to aircraft delivery, the DTF issues, all those things. So I think it's not to tease out. My guess would be that all of those factors probably get worse across the year. The impact of those are going to continue to increase, especially as you see more impacts on capacity and aircraft due to potential Boeing impacts, obviously, the geared turbofan. So more to follow. On our end, obviously, we're focused on Southwest Airlines. I'm really pleased with 2023 and all that we got accomplished that we talked about. We ended the year a much better carrier than we were the year before. The area of course, where I'm not satisfied is our financial performance. We're running roughly four points under our cost of capital right now. And that is our focus here at Southwest, and we've got a really good plan here in '24\u2026\nOperator: Pardon me. This is a conference operator. We seem to have lost connection with the speakers' location. Please stand by what we try to rejoin. [Technical Difficulty] Pardon me, this is the conference operator. We regained the audio from the speaker location. Please continue\nBob Jordan: Jamie, my apologies there. I don't know where we left off. But my point is we are focused on Southwest. We're focused in 24 years on expanding margins covering our cost of capital that sets us up for a lot of momentum to then even make even more progress in 2025. And thinking about capacity for Southwest Airlines, our capacity, our CapEx, as we plan forward, will obviously take into consideration the progress we are making against those financial goals. I just want you to know that. The backdrop of the industry, I think, is going to play out here across 2024, and we'll just have to see.\nJamie Baker: Okay. Helpful. And then second, you've disclosed in the past that you have seriously considered a second fleet type, but decided not to go down that path. I don't have to tell you that industry animosity towards your sole provider is obviously crescendoing, would it be unreasonable to assume your single -- your single fleet conviction might finally begin to wait from here, or is that putting words in your mouth?\nBob Jordan: Yes. Well, let me just back up a second. Obviously, there's a lot going on with Boeing. I mean, the MAX 8 is a great aircraft. We're very satisfied with it. And like Boeing, we support the work of the FAA and the oversight to improve quality, address any issues because at the end of the day, better Boeing is good for Southwest Airlines. The -- we periodically look at aircraft manufacturers and aircraft types. That's something we take up routinely here at Southwest Airlines. We've done that in the past. And our focus right now is on our own fleet plan, our fleet plan with Boeing. Obviously, working with Boeing to get the MAX 7 certified. But we do take that up periodically. You also have to understand every -- I know you know this, but there isn't -- as such, there's no such thing as being able to derisk all of this. Even if you have multiple aircraft providers, say we were 50-50, you'd have 400 aircraft to one type and 400 of another type, and so an issue still creates great risk for the company. So the best thing that we can do is work with Boeing to make them an even better company, which is exactly what's happening. We've got great confidence again in the MAX 8, and we're eager to get to MAX-7, we're not in charge of that certification date. But no, we have confidence that Boeing will get all this figured out with the FAA will come out a better company.\nJamie Baker: Appreciate the color. Take care everyone.\nBob Jordan: Jamie, thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nCatherine O'Brien: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for the time. Maybe just a couple of quick ones. On unit revenue going forward, underlying your double-digit top line forecast for the year. Can you just help us think about where we go from the 1Q unit revenue forecast? I'm assuming based on the full year capacity outlook growth is going to slow from the first quarter into the remaining quarters of the year. So, that would be a sequential tailwind. You'll be lapping some of that easy comp from the book away as we move through the year. How does that impact where you think unit revenue trends quarter-to-quarter. Anything else lumpy we should be considering?\nTammy Romo: Yes. I'll start off and then Ryan, if you want to jump in with any thoughts you have, really, there -- as you pointed out, there's a bit of noise year-over-year. So, probably the best way to kind of help you think through that is sequentially. As you're aware, the first quarter is seasonally a tougher quarter just in general for the airline industry. And we will have our network changes materially in place in March. So, -- and then following on into the summer, we expect to have that fully completed with our summer schedules. And then just as we continue to go through the year, we would expect our development markets to continue to mature, you're aware 10% of our system is development market. And by the end of the year, we expect that to be more in line with our historical percentage of about, call it, 5%. And then on top of that, as Ryan covered, we are -- we believe we'll continue to grow our managed business revenue. We've been with our GDS initiative, and we would expect those benefits to steadily improve as we go through the year. So, we would expect -- we've got a lot of momentum coming into this year. We would expect that to continue and [Technical Difficulty]\nOperator: Pardon me. This is a conference operator. We've again lost audio from the speaker location. Please standby as we try to regain it. Thank you. This is the conference operator. We've regained audio from the speaker's location. Please continue. Thank you.\nBob Jordan: And everybody, sorry about it. We're having some form of conference call issue here, my apologies. But I would just pile on just simply, maybe talk -- cover what Tammy did, which is you have decelerating capacity across the year. 10% Q1, 8% to 10% in the second quarter, 3% to 5% in the third quarter. And then the back half of the year, really is all just [indiscernible]. Trips are down, seats are down. On top of that, the initiatives and particularly the network related revenue initiatives and the development market related initiatives accelerate because they really started in March, accelerated on the summer. So you have decreasing capacity across the year, and you have an accelerated contribution from the network initiatives across the year. That's an indirect answer to your question, but that's how I'm thinking about it.\nRyan Green: Yeah. And I wouldn't add anything else, other than to say that the revenue initiatives, that component of the plan, those are -- there's very little lumpiness in those as well. Those are pretty evenly spread throughout the year. So it's really about the decelerating capacity in the back half of the year and the network maturation and optimization efforts coming on.\nCatherine O'Brien: Makes a lot of sense. And then maybe just for my second question. Would just like to talk about the unit cost side for this year, and I know very early, but maybe first 2025. Can you talk to us just about like some of the incremental headwinds you're expecting for 2024 versus what you were thinking back earlier in 2023 when you're targeting unit costs to be down year-over-year, of course, at least a couple of points that lower capacity. The pilot contract came in higher. It would be great if you could just walk us from that, down year-over-year to up $6 million to $7 million. And then, again, early, but into 2025, if we lap the big step up in wages or back to something more inflationary plus, I'm guessing you're going to get more efficiency back as you go into year two of the network recovery in your optimization phase, like is that when we get the down year-over-year? Any color there would be great. Thanks so much for the time.\nBob Jordan: Thank you, and I'll start, and then I'm sure Tammy you will pile in. I mean the -- we were accrued for our labor contract increases here. We've got nine done, two to go it's really, for the most part, it's rate increases here in 2024. So if you take the pilots, for example, they've got a 4% rate increase. We've got some benefit increases. That's the majority of the $6 million to $7 million. On top of that, you have maintenance pressure that was known. It's really the 800 engines coming off holiday and that's a couple of points. Those are going to be things, wage rate pressure, maintenance pressure that most of the industry shares. Now on the efficiency side, as we go across the year, we've peaked our hiring, and we will -- our target is to end the year in 2024 with fewer heads than we ended the year 2023, which will, of course, naturally make us more efficient for the 7% growth. It\u2019s too early to talk about 2025. But as you maybe think about a forecast there, yeah, you would naturally decelerate from the unit cost pressure this year. And our goal, we're not ready to give you a number, of course, for 2025, but our goal will be to dramatically control that headcount growth again in 2025. And we'll be sharing a lot more about that at our Investor Day later in the year. Tammy, if you want to add anything?\nTammy Romo: Yeah, you really covered it all. But yeah, the story is actually quite simple is labor cost, labor rate cost, obviously, the inflation there is more than we would have anticipated initially. So we've -- with the pilot contract, behind us. We've adjusted our accruals. So most of 2024 is associated with the step -- with the step up in scale increases, wage rate increases and enhanced benefits and Bob covered the maintenance, and we'll share more at Investor Day, but obviously, we're focused on bringing out those efficiencies as we move through 2024 and to a greater degree in 2025.\nCatherine O'Brien: Thanks so much.\nTammy Romo: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. Appreciate the time. So, maybe just one more shot at this. Can you give us your best guess as to the contributors to the sequential improvement here? How much of that five points would you attribute to these network realignment initiatives? And how much would you attribute to just better underlying demand? It's been challenging with airlines to really make a read about the macro based on what airlines are doing in any given quarter. Just like in the third quarter of last year, I didn't think that was a particularly good read on the macro. But if you just look at this revenue outlook here, what is your business telling you about the macro? And are you seeing acceleration and if so, where?\nRyan Green: Yeah, Duane, it's Ryan. I think the macro environment for demand overall is very strong. I mean the way that we closed the fourth quarter, we saw a close-in performance kind of accelerate in the holiday time period which had us -- we came in above our expectations at that point. So I think that, that was a good sign as we got into the year. And as you sit here in the first quarter, the beginning of the first quarter, we've got about 60% of bookings on hand. That's plenty for us to get a good read on how the macro trends are performing. I think demand looks very strong in January and February, which are typically trough periods here. We're performing just fine. As you look into the stronger periods into March, I think spring break travel and the Easter travel period, that's looking very well. And then probably also, as it relates to the overall macro environment, if you just look at managed business trends. I think I mentioned this earlier, fourth quarter was better than third quarter and first quarter is expected to be better than the fourth. We've got very strong bookings in place on the managed business side here for February as we begin to get into that part of the curve. So I think the overall macro environment sets up well for us having a really good year.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Just a follow-up there. Any focus cities or parts of the country that are kind of waking back up for you?\nRyan Green: Well, I would say destination-based markets are doing very well. International is doing very well. Hawaii, we beat our expectations in the fourth quarter. Phoenix, Orlando, Vegas, those markets are doing very well for us. I think when you look, California was slower to come back, it's doing -- it's improving for sure. So it's definitely pockets across the network. But again, I think overall, things continue to improve.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. So can I come back, I think, to the first Q&A here, which was about the premiumization of the industry. Because I think what we did observe through 2023 was some growing yield differential between yourself and maybe some low-cost competitors relative to the network airlines. And I guess I just want to ask the question maybe more bluntly or directly. Does products matter in does it matter as you go further in distance and longer in flight length? And I guess I'd specifically ask about your experience in Hawaii as well. And I guess how do these initiatives that you guys are talking about on the commercial side start to try to address that? Thank you.\nRyan Green: Well, first of all, I would say, absolutely product matters. And I think that certainly from a coach product, Southwest Airlines has the best coach product in the industry. I would just echo what I said on the premium component of this is highly cyclical. And I think that we want -- before we would take up that question, you would want to -- or we would want to study that very closely as we think about that. Your question on how do we do relative in a long-haul market like Hawaii, as I mentioned, we beat expectations. We beat our own expectations for Hawaii in the fourth quarter. I think our yields continue to improve, and the Mainland to Hawaii component of that franchise. And we'll continue to develop those yields further. But no, I think that our product fares very well even in long-haul markets. But yes, on the whole, I think product matters. And I think when you look at the industry together, I think that there's at least some evidence out there today that demand for fares on the bottom end and lower products on the lower end of the segment, there may not be as much demand for those types of products today as what their once was.\nBob Jordan: And Brandon, this is Bob. The only thing I would add is -- and this is no prediction don't read more into this than is there. You've got to meet your customers' demand and their expectations. So as those change over time, you want to understand that. You want to be -- you want to carefully understand that. And we have a history of demonstrating that. So you go back 10 years, we wouldn't have been talking about Wi-Fi. We would not have been talking about power on the aircraft. And you can go on and on and on. There was a time when we didn't even have a loyalty program here at Southwest Airlines. So as consumer demands and expectations change and you've got different generations of flyers coming into the system as well. We will constantly look at that, understand what our customers want. And then if that warrants change, we will look at that, and we will make the right decision. Again, we have a history of doing that with our product here and our customer experience. That's no predictor regarding premium in the cabin. I'm just trying to make sure that you know that we aren't stubborn in this area that as you see demands change, we'll understand that and we will react if needed.\nBrandon Oglenski: Bob and Ryan, I appreciate that. And then maybe if I can just get a quick follow-up for Tammy. Any ability to tell us where you view your weighted cost of capital today?\nTammy Romo: Yes, sure. It's sitting probably -- it's the high 8s, close between 8% and 9%. So we view it as about 8.6%, 8.7%.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. Appreciate that Tammy.\nTammy Romo: But one thing, Brandon, just to add on, over our longer term, it's been closer to 9%. We certainly take a view, a longer-term view when we're planning in terms of our returns on invested capital.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Helane Becker with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, operator. Hi everybody. Thank you for the time. As I look at your numbers for the fourth quarter, your revenues were up at 12.5% or something and your costs were up 10.5% and yet you weren't able to see significant margin improvement because of the things you already talked about where you have inflationary pressure. But as we look forward to the next one year, how should we think about the seasonality of your business now? Because it seems like you said everything was great for the fourth quarter, and yet you didn't perform significantly better than you did last year, and I would have thought that last year, given all the issues, you would have performed a lot better. So maybe you can help me bridge beyond just the obvious labor cost inflation and other inflationary pressures, how you get back to those margins you used to report? And then do you expect -- and then my other question is, do you expect any book away from the flight attendant asking for a strike vote.\nBob Jordan: Yes. Maybe Helane, thank you. Maybe I can start and...\nHelane Becker: That was a lot of question.\nBob Jordan: Yes, I'll try to remember everything. I think just generally, I think the biggest impact, sort of tearing everything aside in the fourth quarter is we did choose to restore capacity quickly. So basically, that was a choice to number one, get our aircraft back to normal utilization, fly all our aircraft, our pilots, all that. And so our capacity, our ramp-up was greater than normal, and therefore, we did have -- you could see it, we had a drop in load factor. I think that's the biggest contributor in terms of the performance rate there that's different than normal. And our '24 plan, obviously, is to get back to normal in that area as we normalize capacity. So to me, that's the biggest thing. And I don't attribute any of that. I'll get to your flight attendant question. We don't -- I don't attribute any of that to book away in the holidays, for example, related to Elliot or something like that. I think it really was the rate of capacity restoration. As we look at our consumer -- our customer behaviors, we look at our customer metrics, demand for Southwest Airlines, there's no indicator or indication that we saw any hangover or book away. In fact, the holiday periods were the strongest periods of the quarter. Your question about the flight attendant, and I'm really proud of our labor folks. We ratified nine agreements in just over a year. We have two to go, one of those with TW 556 are flight attendants. We were at federal mediation. And in federal mediation, you follow the mediator, and the mediator determines your dates and when you meet and we're eager to get a contract done. And just like our pilots who are in mediation, I'm confident we can do that. The SAV or the strike vote does not mean you are headed to a strike. There are many, many, many things that have to occur before we get to that point. So, I'm not worried about a strike despite the strike authorization vote. When we saw our pilots, I take an SAV or strike authorization vote. We did not see any very little customer even indicator that the customers were focused on it or aware. So I don't expect any kind of hangover from that here in terms of customer demand with -- because of the flight attendant vote. Ryan, do you want to add anything there?\nRyan Green: No, there's no evidence in anything that we track from a customer sentiment perspective that would make us concerned about that.\nBob Jordan: That sentiment is fully recovered to at this point. And our NPS scores, our customer satisfaction have recently have been records and certainly back to pre-pandemic levels.\nHelane Becker: Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you.\nBob Jordan: Thank you.\nOperator: We have time for one more question. We'll take that last question from Dan McKenzie with Seaport Global. Please go ahead.\nDan McKenzie: Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. I guess on efficiency and further improvement to come in 2025, for investors that want -- or that would like line of sight on where FTEs per aircraft could ultimately go, what prior year could serve as a good benchmark. I guess that's first. And then secondly, is that reasonable to assume Southwest could get there fully in 2025.\nBob Jordan: Yes, I'll answer directly and add Andrew, if you want to chime in. I think we're not ready to talk about that in maybe as much detail as you want until we get to our Investor Day here later this year. But absolutely, it's just like the goal of covering our cost of capital this year, and getting back to our historic returns and ROIC well above WACC, restoring efficiency is right alongside in terms of the key goal or a key goal. We ramped up our hiring quickly to be able to restore the network and get all of our aircraft flying. That hiring peaked in October to November, and we have been decelerating that rapidly here in the last 60 days. The plan is to, again, to grow six-or-so percent this year and then to end this year with the same or fewer heads than we began the year, which will obviously help our efficiency quite a bit. Not ready to discuss 2025, but we would have certainly a directionally similar goal in 2025. We also have a significant number to hate to tease here. We have a significant number of efficiency initiatives that we are planning around both efficiency of the aircraft, efficiency of our people and processes as we think about things like the turn, and we'll be sharing a lot more about that again in our Investor Day later this year.\nAndrew Watterson: I'd say, Bob, one element to that on that is the same kind of cross-functional groups we use to kind of rapidly accelerate our hiring that same team is now responsible for driving up these efficiencies. So that is something that is literally every week kind of needing to get to achieve what you just said about where the headcount split at the end of the year. And I'd also say that while we're conscious of the FTE per aircraft, we're actually managing a lever or squib CASM because if you think about aircraft, I could fly that different ways. We could say you'd have two flights a day and my ground obviously needs a different fluids six times a day. And then the block hours for the aircraft would change pilot pay, if it was a longer block hours per aircraft or less further less. So the ultimate CASM you get out of your aircraft depends on how you're flying it and how you're deploying staff against it. So the FTE per aircraft is a useful measure can have, but it's A, hard to compare across the airlines because of the outsourcing, but B, dependent on how you fit the aircraft it and give some -- a little bit of false signal, but you can really look at what we're going to try to do for the labor CASM and get that to a good order.\nDan McKenzie: Very good. And if I could just squeeze 1 last 1 in here. It's a question on the shift to the cloud. How much of Southwest has shifted to the cloud at this point? And once you complete that endeavor, what could the savings ultimately look like once that transition is completed? Is it tens of millions, hundreds of millions? And is that an opportunity?\nBob Jordan: I'd tell you what, you're stretching my technical abilities here, but I believe like a lot of companies, we have a path to shift to the cloud. But again, it's to shift the appropriate things to the cloud. It's not as simple as it might sound. I think we have shifted something on the order of just below 50% is what I've got in my head, and we have a goal to shift a lot more. Some of that is cost savings, absolutely. And -- but I think that is more modest. A lot of what you gain is reliability. And the ability to fail over systems and obviously support operations, support our systems, which is critical here in an airline. You have systems that can't be down 30 minutes cause you an operational problem. So, a lot of the shift to the cloud is as much a resiliency effort and a modernization of the code base and all that effort as it is a cost savings. Certainly, you'll see cost savings. And -- but I just don't -- not my guess is it's more in the tens of millions than it is hundreds of millions\nAndrew Watterson: I think, Bob, we -- I mean, fraction side it used to be very good progress. But when we talk about it internally, we're not talking so much of the cost you can take a hosted bigger system, breakup in micro services that are in the cloud and allows you to then get productivity and how you refresh and improve that application over time. So, it's really the speed to market for these new products and support the products is really what drives the benefit. So, it's elsewhere in the business, you get the benefit not so much any kind of hosted costs, if you will.\nBob Jordan: The other lease of that, too, and then we'll -- I'll stop is the -- there is a -- it's not a tech cost, but there is a very high cost, both revenue and expense and being down and having an issue. And you saw issues earlier this year or last year, like the NOTAM outage that really hurt the industry. And so to the extent that you can reduce issues, reduce the number of the issues, the length of time of an issue or reduce them completely. My guess is that is more powerful in terms of cost reduction than even the technology reduction because reducing IROPs is very powerful.\nDan McKenzie: Very good. Thanks so much for the time guys.\nBob Jordan: Dan, thank you.\nJulia Landrum: Okay. That completes the analyst portion of our call. A quick reminder that the transcript and a replay of the call will be available on our Investor Relations' website. I appreciate everyone joining, and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin with our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Whitney Eichinger, Chief Communications Officer.\nWhitney Eichinger: Thanks, Gary. I'd like to welcome members of the media to our call today. Before we begin taking questions, Gary, could you please give instructions on how everyone should queue up for a question?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alison Sider with The Wall Street Journal.\nAlison Sider: Hi, thanks so much. I just wanted to see what you made of a center of Duckworth today calling on the FAA to deny the waiver Boeing of Sox to MAX 7. Is that anti-ice issue, do you think that something Boeing should have to address before they can start delivering those planes?\nBob Jordan: I'll start, and Andrew, you'll file in, Ali. Obviously, the certification of the MAX 7 and the issue there, that's really Boeing. I don't want to speak for Boeing or get ahead here. Obviously, we want the MAX 7 and we want it on the best timing possible. So I don't want to talk for Boeing, but it is one more thing to consider here in the certification process and certification time line.\nAndrew Watterson: I would say that the certification is a technical process between the FAA and Boeing. And I think they've been doing a good job. It's been slower than we would like, but it's been technically based and it's off a public comment. So it's an opportunity for people to comment on that for technical analysis to be done. And so we're not a party to that. We want the aircraft. It's a question of when we'll get it, not if we'll get it. So we're pleased that they're taking their time to make sure it's safe and we support whatever way the FA wants to go.\nAlison Sider: And I mean do you have any plans to increase your own oversight of Southwest Plans on the Boeing production line?\nAndrew Watterson: We have already done that. So in late 2022, we changed our posture up there. Previously, we had for a long time, they have representatives at the factory. We increased it to a team of AMP (OTC:AMLTF) license mechanics, whose job is to provide oversight of our aircraft in the production process. The Boeing provides customer quality people that are on their payroll, but our direction. And so they inspect at places where we ask in the factory the few days that Boeing takes to assemble an aircraft from the wings being built to rolling out. It's about roughly 80 areas where we have our requirements for things to be expected. Those people inspect -- our people inspect. And then several times a year, our quality assurance team goes up and inspect our inspectors to make sure everything is going well. So that provides a really good oversight in the production process once it leaves the factory, there's a customary acceptance in spectrums that happened the FAA overseas and give a final certificate of air worthiness. And then it comes on to our ops spec and we in our maintenance program, which is quite robust. And since we're by far the largest operator of the 737, we have provided lots of data and our continuing analysis and safety surveillance system allows for us to really understand the aircraft and make sure that it's performing and conforming as expected.\nAlison Sider: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question is from Leslie Josephs with CNBC. Please go ahead.\nLeslie Josephs: Hi. I was wondering if you have any thoughts about how a Chapter 7 of an airline in the United States would affect the industry? Are there jobs for those employees should that happen? And then do you think that the Justice Department would ever let you buy another airline?\nBob Jordan: Hey, Leslie, it's Bob. We don't -- obviously, like I said earlier, there is a lot going on in the industry. They're between merger potential mergers and acquisitions and issues with aircraft deliveries, the geared turbofan, I don't know in my 36 years in the industry. I've seen more moving parts as you have right now. One thing that's consistent here is we stick to our business. So we're focused on Southwest Airlines, improving Southwest Airlines being the best carrier that we can be improving our returns and profit and margins, all the things that we've talked about. It's impossible to speculate on what might happen. Our history would say that as opportunities arise for Southwest, if they make sense, we take a look at that. But I wouldn't want to speculate on anything going on in the industry, certainly around any other carrier.\nAndrew Watterson: I think with the benefit for Southwest Airlines, Bob, is that we have a plan and we control our destiny. We hit our plan, we get our returns where we need to be. We don't need something to break our way to judge or anything else or rule anything. Our plan delivers our results.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rajesh Singh with Reuters. Please go ahead.\nRajesh Singh: Hi. Andrew, do you have any update on the time line for certification of MAX 7. Earlier, it was expected by April. So do you see any risk of the certification process getting slowed down due to the current events with Boeing?\nAndrew Watterson: Well, we get weekly updates on the status of the certification process. So we know what's been submitted and what hasn't. But obviously, then the FAA is the one who oversees that and inspect it makes ultimate decision previously, we've indicated that we had -- in our internal plan and assumption that it would be certified by April and that we would then spend time after of that. I think on our of spec that could take us at the end of the year, and therefore, it would be flat until next year. But that is -- that was only the latest assumption. We've had earlier assumptions all along this process. And as Tammy mentioned, we will modify our plan based on the new information. So should that change, we will move our assumptions and adapt our plan. So by this kind of conservative approach and giving ourselves the lead time, we won't let any kind of short-term ups or downs affect what we have planned for this year.\nRajesh Singh: And Bob, I have question for you. Do you have confidence in Boeing's currently sit to address place who's facing the company?\nBob Jordan: Hey, Rajesh, Boeing has been a partner with us for 52 years. And I have absolute confidence that between the FAA oversight work that's going on, the work that Boeing is doing that Boeing will working with the FAA will address the quality issues, and we'll obviously come out of this a better company. I've talked personally to their leadership. They're committed to doing anything and everything it takes to be better and to address the problems. And as I said before, a better Boeing is very good for Southwest Airlines. So yeah, I have absolute confidence that they will work their way through this and address the issues.\nRajesh Singh: Thank you.\nBob Jordan:\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Eichinger for any closing remarks.\nWhitney Eichinger: Thanks, Gary. The news release and our contact information are available at swamedia.com. We thank everyone for joining.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor. For more information see our T&C."

        "article_content": " \n\nLSI Industries Inc. (LYTS) has reported fiscal second-quarter results that met expectations, despite encountering some temporary challenges, particularly in the grocery vertical. The company's Lighting segment saw a slight decline in sales by 3%, but gross margin improved to 35%. The Display Solutions segment experienced difficulties within the grocery sector but secured substantial projects in the refueling space. LSI Industries generated a notable $7 million in free cash flow, reduced its debt to less than $19 million, and declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share. With the anticipation of continued growth and increased demand in the grocery vertical, driven by a major merger in the pipeline, LSI expects sales to rise in the upcoming quarters. The company is actively pursuing strategic growth initiatives and is managing its cash, debt, and capital allocation effectively.\nLSI Industries remains confident in its ability to sustain improvements and manage efficiency and margins effectively. The company's supply chain has become more predictable, and manufacturing efficiency improvements, along with supply chain optimization, have contributed to the increased gross margin. LSI Industries is also considering the remodeling of over 1,000 Burger King franchise stores and is focused on delivering value through realistic conversations and reliable execution. Despite some headwinds, the company is optimistic about its future growth potential and M&A activities, emphasizing a disciplined approach to evaluating cultural fit and meaningful conversations with potential partners.\nLSI Industries Inc. (LYTS) has shown resilience in its fiscal second-quarter performance, with strategic initiatives paving the way for future growth. Here are some key insights from InvestingPro that can provide a deeper understanding of the company's financial health and market position:\nInvestingPro Data shows that LSI Industries has a market capitalization of $407.5 million, indicating its size and significance in the industry. The company's Price/Earnings (P/E) Ratio stands at 14.97, which, when compared to the adjusted P/E ratio for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 at 15.0, suggests that the company is trading at a consistent valuation relative to its earnings. Moreover, the PEG Ratio for the same period is 0.79, hinting that the company's earnings growth is potentially undervalued by the market, which could be a point of interest for value investors.\nAn InvestingPro Tip that stands out is the company's high shareholder yield, which is a positive signal for investors looking for companies that return value to shareholders. Additionally, the fact that LSI Industries has maintained dividend payments for 37 consecutive years showcases its commitment to consistent shareholder returns, a testament to its financial stability and prudent capital management.\nFor those considering investing in LSI Industries, note that there are 8 additional InvestingPro Tips available, offering a comprehensive analysis of the company's performance and future outlook.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jim Galeese. Thank you. You may begin.\nJim Galeese: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining. We issued a press release before the market opened this morning, detailing our fiscal '24 second quarter results. In addition to this release, we posted a conference call presentation in the Investor Relations section of our corporate website. Information contained in this presentation will be referenced throughout today's conference call, included are certain non-GAAP measures for improved transparency of our operating results. A complete reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results is contained in our press release and 10-Q. Please note that management's commentary and responses to today's questions on today's conference call may include forward-looking statements about our business outlook. Such statements involve risks and opportunities and actual results could differ materially. I refer you to our safe harbor statement, which appears in this morning's press release as well as our most recent 10-K and 10-Q. Today's call will begin with remarks summarizing our fiscal second quarter results. At the conclusion of these prepared remarks, we will open the line for questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to LSI President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Clark.\nJim Clark: Thank you, Jim, and good morning all. Thank you for joining us on today's call. As noted in our press release issued earlier today, LSI continues to perform well and in line with our expectations despite some temporary headwinds in our grocery vertical. In our Lighting segment, sales were down 3% for the quarter on prior year sales, while gross margin improved meaningfully to 35%. This performance both in sales and margin reflects our continued ability to manage the business and take share even while we are in a challenging year-over-year comparison and general business environment. Our quote and order activity remains high, up almost 10% from last year while our conversion rate from quote to sales remains extended but stable. While the broader lighting market in many of our competitors have struggled to maintain top-line momentum, LSI has been successful in finding and creating opportunities for growth and we remain focused on profitable sales. In our Display Solutions segment, the headwinds in the grocery vertical have had broader impact as they have challenged momentum in our graphics, standalone displays and refrigerated products. This impact is more apparent when compared to our lighting segment. As we noted a few months back, we recently awarded a significant win in our Display Solutions Group in the refueling space with 1,325 sites set to span three years and another award that will include more than 7,000 locations averaging 700 to 1000 sites per year. This project will span considerably longer. Our normal flow of business in this space and the overall refueling vertical feels very robust right now. In addition to these recent project wins, we are currently engaged with two major C-store customers who are multi-site testing our refrigerated product in a number of locations. In fact, a recent article published in last month's Wall Street Journal underlines our thesis of continued growth in this segment and the solutions approach offered by LSI fits very well. The article is titled Gas with a Side of Pizza and it goes to underline the opportunity, the investment in the higher margin sales that accompany a traditional gas station by engaging in-store sales. We are very experienced and recognized in this space as a high quality solutions provider and we're confident we will have continued notable wins. Addressing the slowdown in the grocery vertical specifically, I would like to note that two of the largest grocery chains in the U.S. are currently engaged in a proposed merger. This merger has been under an extended federal regulatory review process and has caused a temporary slowdown across the entire grocery vertical as companies within this sector await the results of the review and the possible changes to the competitive landscape. Although it's impossible to see what the future will hold in this space and the timing associated with the approval process, we anticipate that there will be continued growth and pent-up demand as the merger process moves forward. While we are disappointed with the time this process is taking, we believe that whether the merger occurs or fails to move forward, it will likely generate significant opportunity for additional business as the landscape continues to evolve and change. These changes that help our customers engage and retain customers fit very well with the products and services LSI offers, and we will be prepared to serve this market now and into the future. On the new products front, LSI continues to set the bar in new product introductions and innovation. Staying on pace with our 20 plus new product introductions or product revisions each of the last five years, I'm proud to say that, our new R-290 environmentally sustainable refrigerated product was DoE or Department of Energy certified and UL approved earlier this month and our first article has already shipped to one of our customers. Interest in this product is very high and we anticipate continued growth with this solutions as customers test the effectiveness with R-290 in their own store environment. Turning to our Lighting segment. We recently introduced two completely new lighting products, including our linear aerial outdoor lighting product and our new Peak Series High Bay light, which is a modular product that includes a rotatable light engine and lens that can be rotated 180 degrees in fixed 30 degree increments. These products not only expand our broad solution set, but allow our customers and agents to access unique lighting solutions that showcase their properties and their business. Next week, LSI will be hosting our National Sales Conference. This annual meeting provides an elevated forum for our sales, marketing, engineering and product development teams to meet, discuss, debate and create opportunities. This is a real learning experience for our team and our company and we always gain momentum coming off of this conference. I'm proud of the work the team is doing and I feel we have a lot of opportunities in front of us. There is no question the impact across the entirety of our grocery vertical is causing some headwinds, but I feel the team has pivoted quite effectively to offset a majority of those headwinds and we are enthusiastic about the possible tailwinds we could experience, as this process works its way to conclusion. We have the capabilities and the capacity to respond and we are excited about the ongoing improvements to our business and the possibilities that lie ahead. With that, I will turn the call back over to Jim Galeese for a deeper look at our overall financial performance. Jim?\nJim Galeese: Thank you, Jim. Our fiscal second quarter results reflect ongoing strong execution in key vertical markets, while managing the expected temporary demand disruption in the grocery vertical. We maintained a steadfast focus on quality of earnings, including successfully managing selling price and product cost. These efforts generated a year-over-year 240 basis point improvement in gross margin and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.1% equal to prior year on lower sales. This resulted in adjusted earnings per share of $0.21 for the second quarter and for the first half of the fiscal year, earnings per share were $0.50 equal to the prior year first half. The business again generated over $7 million of free cash flow in the quarter, further reducing debt now under $19 million and lower the TTM ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net debt to 0.4x. Our cash flow and debt position support our capital allocation priorities and provides the balance sheet optionality for future investments. One of those priorities includes investing in profitable organic growth. Investment in critical capital programs was over $3 million for the first half of for fiscal year. Investments were spread across both lighting and display solutions and included key machinery and tooling to support new products, increased operating capacity, throughput and productivity. In addition, we remain committed to a balanced approach for driving shareholder value, announcing a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share to be paid on February 13th for shareholders of record February 5th. Now, a few comments on segment performance. Momentum continues in our Lighting segment. Operating income increased 28% year-over-year on sales of $65 million or 3% below last year. We continue to outperform the broader market further improving our share position. The lighting gross margin rate improved significantly, increasing 440 basis points to 35% with multiple items contributing to the rate expansion. Items include a higher value mix, stable pricing, moderately lower material input costs, value engineering and manufacturing productivity. Lighting orders for the quarter were 10% above prior year. Increasing the backlog as we enter fiscal Q3. Quote activity remains favorable as our key verticals continue to generate higher activity rates than the broader non-resi construction market. Our team has done an effective job managing the timing variability in the quote-to-order conversion cycle, constructing our supply chain and production planning to allow for fluctuating demand patterns. We expect lighting momentum to continue in the second half of the fiscal year. Moving to Display Solutions, second quarter performance reflects the disruption in project activity throughout the grocery vertical. We continue to work closely with our customers on project timing with several large projects in turnkey position waiting on release. We use this disruption period to prepare for the return to normal demand activity. Relocation and startup of our new refrigeration production facility is complete and operational. And as Jim mentioned, we received final UL approval on the new environmentally friendly R-290 display case. The first customer unit shipped last week. Our backlog in the refueling C-store vertical has increased significantly in the last several quarters. In fiscal Q2, a large oil company awarded LSI the brand refresh program for over 1,300 locations. Program is structured for LSI to be the turnkey provider responsible for site planning through installation. We're seeing an increasing trend in programs requesting or requiring turnkey solutions, as customers recognize the value of our comprehensive solution capabilities. Looking forward, we expect Q3 Display Solutions sales to increase modestly from Q2 levels, performance will vary by vertical with refueling graphics increasing as site release activity begins on several major programs. Refueling activity is projected to remain strong throughout calendar year '24 and '25. As project release activity begins to occur, grocery sales will increase somewhat sequentially in Q3 from Q2, but remain below prior year. Grocery project activity is expected to accelerate in the fourth quarter and into fiscal '25. Our focus and priorities for Q3 remain the same, advancing our strategic growth initiatives, exhibit smart, disciplined, business execution and effectively managing cash debt and capital allocation. The underlying trend for our target markets remain positive and we are confident in our plans moving forward. I will now return the call back to the moderator for the question-and-answer session.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Aaron Spychalla with Craig-Hallum Capital Group.\nAaron Spychalla: First, for me on, C-stores, good commentary on the move to fresh food that's happening there and initial progress on the cross-selling. Can you just talk about, maybe how big that opportunity can be with those initial customers and over time as we look out a couple of years?\nOperator: I believe the speakers were disconnected. I think they're dialing back in now. Okay. Bear with us, and we will get the conference back. Get them back on. I believe our speakers are live. Please proceed.\nJim Clark: Apologies everyone.\nOperator: Okay. Aaron, you can continue.\nAaron Spychalla: Appreciate the commentary on the move to fresh foods in that industry and initial progress on the cross-selling. Can you just talk about how big that opportunity could be for you, as we look out a couple of years? And then just separately on the 7,500 site awarded, I saw mention of that being 3.5 years instead of 4.5 years before. Can you just kind of talk about shortening refresh cycles there and if that project has started yet and just maybe some more details there?\nJim Clark: Yes, absolutely. Thank you for joining. Thanks for the call, and apologies to everyone on the line for the technical issue. We see the opportunity in terms of the expansion in cross-selling, particularly in grocery, C-store environment and a few others, quick-serve retail, with the combination of our graphics, lighting, display and refrigerated display solutions, as being very big. I mean, I don't know how to quantify it or qualify it bigger than that, but we are talking about markets that are annually in the billions of dollars. By every measure, we're still on aggregate a small player. Not that there's necessarily a larger player than us with the aggregated solution that we offer, it's just that the market opportunity is very big. I don't know how to quantify it over that, except to say again that it's in the billions of dollars. In terms of the cycle time, in the projects we've won, there are two projects. I'll just take a second to mention them specifically. There is the 1,300 location project, which is a refresh and that is scheduled and we have a firm commitment on a three year span. There is a second project which is over 7,000 locations and the goal is to get it done in 3.5 years, but factoring in some of the material challenges and some of the customer zone challenges and realistically kind of trying to set a goalpost for that. We think it's going to be in excess of, it will likely be 700 to 1000 sites a year. And so it puts us in excess of five to seven years to get that done, but as we're in the project, I think we'll have more updates maybe annually or in a couple of quarters, we'll get a better feel for the customer's ability to move forward. We think we can easily double the current number within our existing footprint and within our existing system. But again, it requires the cooperation of the customer and the sites to be available and all those type of things. So, it's good news. I think that we'll find out more in terms of the timing as we move forward.\nAaron Spychalla: And then just on grocery, your commentary on an increase slight in the third quarter, but accelerating into 4Q in 2025. Can you just talk a little bit about how much of this is coming from the new R-290 offering versus just overall activity starting to recover? And then just maybe thoughts on how big the two large customers are as a part of this recovery?\nJim Clark: Yes. So number one, let me just talk on the headwinds we're facing, the temporary slowdown in the grocery vertical, if you will. It doesn\u2019t -- it isn't specifically related to one or two customers. It's really broad across the market that we serve. And I believe the reason being that should this FTC related review and etcetera continue to drag on. The uncertainty about who, from a competitor standpoint, who are you competing against. Are you competing against one of the newly merged stores? Are you competing against your known competitor? Are you possibly buying a location that they're exiting? Are you competing against a location where they will exit completely? So, I think the impact or we believe the impact is much broader than just one or two customers. It's across a segment as the entire segment looks to see who will my competition be and how will I have to compete against them and where will I have to invest to compete against this new entity or the momentum that they're likely to drive in this sector. So, right now for us the delays are strictly regulatory related and the progress on that is we just don't have a crystal ball to see where that ends up happening. With that said though, whether things move forward or whether things move forward or whether they don't, we believe that, there is pent-up demand and there is pent-up opportunity. We have -- we are hopeful that regardless of the progress on this that things will continue to shake loose in the third quarter here, which we are already in, but certainly into the fourth quarter. Any of the timing on those things could be disrupted. In terms of R-290 versus our traditional solutions, right now everything is based on the traditional solution. Any changeover to R-290 are conversations that are going on now, and we anticipate that we have shipped these products, there is high interest in them, but we expect that the adoption rate certainly could take the better part of the year. I think most of our customers will look to experiment with the product, make sure that it performs to the expectations that where marketing it will perform to, we are very confident it will. But I think that in a solid process, they will take and they will slowly put this out into the field and see how it performs, provide feedback and then continue to move forward to that. So I wouldn't suspect that over the next year, this year, this calendar year 2024, in any of our calls, we are going to be talking about a big momentum shift. But, we will be supplying more and more of that product as we move forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Amit Dayal with H.C. Wainwright.\nAmit Dayal: With respect to this C-store investments and upgrades you are anticipating, Jim, do we have the products and offerings in place already to meet this type of demand or is that something you will be working on? Any insight on what kind of investments will be required to meet this potential cycle of upgrades?\nJim Clark: Absolutely, Amit. Thank you for joining. Thanks for the question. We certainly have the capacity, the skill and the experience to do it. As we talked about on other calls, this is our normal kind of course of business. We typically get involved. We are putting anywhere from 9 to 18 to 24 months of pre-planning of test systems back and forth, changes to what the actual products are going to be delivered and what they are going to look like. When a contract award is given, it's not uncommon for us to be looking at anywhere from 18 to 36 to 60 months or longer project depending on the number of sites. We feel very confident that, we have not only these two opportunities and they will fit very well into our current production schedule, but that we also have additional capabilities and plans to scale up, as we move forward. So within our current infrastructure, we have the plans -- we have the capacity to handle this plus more to provide in our normal customers or another opportunity and we have the plans, which are not excessively capital-intensive to scale up beyond that. The only change that we have made to accommodate for these two large projects is, we are in a facility right now that allows us some expansion and we took on another, what was it, 12,000, 15,000 square feet, Jim?\nJim Galeese: Yes.\nJim Clark: 15,000 square feet. Just to give us a little bit more running room, but we could have done it within the space that we had.\nAmit Dayal: And are you already seeing some of this in your other segments like QSRs, etcetera? I mean, it looks like you are benefiting from these types of investments by your customers already, right? Or maybe you will in the future?\nJim Clark: Yes, we are absolutely benefiting from the changes that are going on in the market, these competitive forces. As we have talked about often, we believe the sectors we are in, grocery being a very strong sector, the C-store sector. I talked about it a little bit in my comments earlier about a great Wall Street Journal article published last month. December 16th, it's called Gas with a Side of Pizza. It just talks about that in-store transaction and how well we're set up to deliver on those requirements. And it spans across the entire offering that we have: lighting, graphics, standalone displays, refrigerated displays, digital graphics, these are all key elements to that expansion and one that are really driving margin improvement for our customers not just in the petroleum space but in the grocery space, in the QSR space. So, although grocery is temporarily disrupted right now, we still feel all of our original thesis is sound and it's not going to be -- it's a temporary pause. It's not anything structural to this market. And we believe it could really be a boom to going forward. And I want to underline, we have the capacity to be able to respond to it and we have the plans to be able to respond with additional capabilities if we need to.\nAmit Dayal: Just one last question for me. The quality of earnings improvement on that front, is this here to stay or do you expect some variance from these levels going forward depending on how the marketing sales and other overhead needs develop to you as you scale your businesses?\nJim Clark: Yes. I mean you folks have been following us for a while. A lot of the people on this call have been following us for a while. We have plans to continue to get incremental improvements out of the business. I would define it as saying we still have a lot of runway left in front of us. We've talked about this on prior calls that there is still just environmentally out of our control, but general environmentally opportunities, supply chain is -- we've always been able to manage the supply chain very well, and we've had a lot of advantages that we have been able to extract from that and will continue to. But as that continues to improve outside of our control, that's going to benefit us. Stable labor and workforce that has continued to benefit us. Customer projects that have been on hold or deferred, those will continue to benefit us. We think, we have a lot of runway left for continued improvement on the margins. And like I said in last quarter's call, remember, our EBITDA was 12.2% for the quarter and we do have some efficiencies that we're able to gain through our peak seasons versus our slower seasons. Q2 and Q3 are slower seasons. It's seasonally affected cold weather, weather in general, that type of thing. Construction slows down, remodels slow down. So our efficiency and our ability to manage margin is a little bit more impacted. But you can see that, even in our slower quarters here, Q2, Q3, we are into Q3 now, but Q2, we are still able to extract those opportunities and extract improvements. I think there is still a lot of runway left in front of us.\nJim Galeese: Amit, Jim Galeese here. Just to build on what Jim said, what gives us confidence is, the improvement is not being driven by one certain item, but there is multiple factors contributing both from a commercial lever as well as the operational lever. Commercially, starting with where we play and then our ability to effectively price manage our projects. And then secondly, operationally sourcing from supply chain, Jim mentioned with material input costs, the impact of new products, design savings, labor productivity. So we track all of those very closely and there is a lot of greens. It gives us confidence that, our improvements, which now have been improving quarter-on-quarter for quite some time, we are confident in our ability to sustain that and build on that because of the multiple levers contributing to the improvement.\nOperator: Our next question is from Leanne Hayden with Canaccord Genuity.\nLeanne Hayden: Hi, everyone. This is Leanne Hayden on for George Gianarikas. Just a couple of questions from me. Can you just discuss any bottlenecks you might see in the supply chain, for example, permitting or equipment like transformers or any potential bottlenecks you might be seeing?\nJim Clark: Yes. Leanne, thanks for calling and tell George we missed them. I will say that, supply chain has become very predictable for us now or much more predictable, I should say. Issues like permits and other suppliers are still variable and still exist out there. I'm sure there is nobody on this call that doesn't follow the industrial markets that understand the challenges around switchgear and things like that. None of those canceled projects, so to speak. They just disrupt the timing of them. And I think where we are right now is, we are just comfortably in that uncomfortable spot. Although those disruptions still occur, I would say, they are much more stable and they are more reflective of the pace of the business we have now. So I don't want to say that, there isn't any impact from them and I don't want to say that, somebody couldn't give us a surprise. But I would like to say that, within that environment, we are very comfortable now. It's just a protracted in a longer environment. But it doesn't result in massive disruption to project schedules, as it had in the past and it doesn't disrupt the customer's commitment moving forward.\nLeanne Hayden: And then I believe this was touched on briefly in transcript, but could you share or update us on your thoughts around M&A and how the target pipeline is looking at? Have your accretion parameters changed at all? Any updates in that realm would be great.\nJim Clark: Yes. I mean it's frustrating to me that I can't disclose everything that we are engaged in or talking about or that we came close to or any of that type of thing. But I would categorize it as this. We are very actively involved. We have looked at a number of projects. We want to make sure they are good fits, from a business perspective obviously and a cultural perspective which we highly value here and anything we are looking at in terms of an acquisition. We are in a very good position financially as you noted. As you've all probably noted, our leverage ratio now is 0.4. We're in a very good position there. We have very good financial partners. And we have discussed and we have plans, if we needed to do something that required beyond our current access. So, all of those things are lining up. In general, I feel the market is more active right now in terms of potential opportunities. I think that a lot of the pricing, the expectations from sellers is better normalized, if you will. But the competition is still very fierce. Financial buyers are still out there. They are still willing to accelerate the multiples paid and things like that. So, we find ourselves in a very competitive a process, but we find that we're engaged in more opportunities now. So, net on net, I would say we are very encouraged and I am very hopeful that we will be able to advance something certainly within the next year, if not sooner.\nOperator: Our next question is from Rick Fearon with Accretive Capital Partners.\nRick Fearon: Hi, Jim and Jim, and congrats on another solid quarter. Yes, just a really impressive uptick in your gross margin and I know improvement in that scale doesn't come easily. So, just interested in hearing what some of the levers may have been to achieve this increase, especially on the Lighting side?\nJim Clark: Yes. I mean, I think that some of the things, well, first of all, Rick, thanks for joining. Thanks for the question. I think some of the things we've talked about in the past are still the levers we're able to pull. And if I were to kind of try to paint a picture, those levers that we're pulling, we've pulled them a quarter of the way, two-thirds of the way. We still have room in them. But chiefly, it's manufacturing efficiency improvements and ongoing improvements in our manufacturing efficiency. Supply chain, we've got a very good team relative to supply chain. It's not just about pricing, it's about being good partners to our suppliers that supply us, being predictable. Giving them the forecast that we stay on and they have been reliable suppliers. When you do that, you are no longer expediting things. You are not pulling the lever for contingencies. You are not disrupting your manufacturing process that is expensive. So, I want to say there's simple, well grounded, basic kind of levers of running a good business, and our team is just good at doing that. We think that we still have levers to pull and room within the levers we're pulling.\nRick Fearon: And as I know you're well aware, LSI's longstanding customer, Burger King just announced the acquisition of their largest franchisee, Carrols Restaurant Group (NASDAQ:TAST). And in the announcement, they also talked about remodeling over 1,000 franchise stores over the next five years. And so, can't help but think there's some opportunity there. I was just interested in your perspective on this as well as really any other QSR activity that might be on the horizon?\nJim Clark: Yes, I don't have, I'm aware of that transaction and congratulations to them. I'm sure that given the pace at which they're making changes within their system, they will benefit from it and we will benefit from it. I will say that, it's a great partnership. We really respect the way they run their business and the plans they have in mind and their execution matches up very well with ours. And that's why I think we have become such strong partners with them. And I will say, it\u2019s the exact same thing that attracts a number of the potential customers or a number of newer customers we are dealing with. That very high say do ratio, right? We are not super flashy, although I think some of our solutions are. We\u2019re not -- we don't over commit. We sit down and have realistic conversations with them and other partners in that space, and I think we have gotten real value out of that. The customers have gotten real value out of that, because they know what to expect. We deliver and we say we are going to do. And it fits very well within that structure of that environment because it's very hard to come in and make those changes without potentially disrupting their normal flow of business and we have earned the reputation of being able to do that. And I think that our customer is responding very well to it. So I'm very excited what we will see, what will happen there. I would suspect that, we are right there in that planning process.\nRick Fearon: Yes. It really speaks volumes to have a customer like Burger King and such strong customers like Burger King on the QSR side. And so, you guys are obviously doing things right to keep them happy. Yes, my only other question really, sort of follow-up on one of the other questions relates to your strong balance sheet. You have once again reproduced with the methodical debt reduction, great work on that front. And so, yes, here we are with have some, I'm sure, exciting opportunities that are coming across the desk. And just wondered if you could provide any color on valuations. Like, it sounds like, it is more of a buyer's market than it has been, but curious if that's consistent with what you are seeing.\nJim Clark: Yes, I mean, I'm not sure I'm willing to jump on. It's completely a buyer's market, but it has changed, right? So it has changed a bit. I still think there is great respect for the businesses that are currently for sale and they want to get maximum value whether they are financially-owned or independently individually or corporate-owned or whatever it is. So the pricing is obviously pricing and valuations still remain a key element. I would say, overall in perspective, inflation has hit the valuations also. But we feel very encouraged that, the conversations are much more meaningful now. They are much more balanced. It's kind of the best analog I can give it. It's kind of like the real estate market. A couple of years back, properties that were up for sale, agents were saying, submit your best and final no home inspection. All bids are due by 3 PM, that type of thing. And much like that in the M&A environment, we feel that, the conversations are much more meaningful. They are much more future oriented. They are proud of the accomplishments they have had, where the business is, or they are aware of where the business is. But they are much more willing to talk about put future opportunities in wide and support their valuations and that's what we enjoy in those conversations. And as you know, most of the people on this call know, we also highly value cultural fit right? There are businesses we would like to be involved in, but we sit down and we realize -- we're just not a good fit. We see things differently. We value things differently. And although the business might fit well in our plan, if we have to go in and change course of that business, we know that the value is just not there for us. So, it's a funny shaped little door. We continue to be very disciplined in what we look at, and but we are excited and we do think that there's opportunity on the horizon for us.\nRick Fearon: That discipline on the culture side I'm sure saves a lot of headaches. So, you proved yourself at JSI and wonderful acquisition and look forward to hearing more about the next to come. But thanks for the perspective and all your nice work.\nJim Clark: Thank you.\nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer section. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Jim Clark for concluding remarks.\nJim Clark: I don't think there's any question. If you heard our comments, you read our press release, we're certainly facing some headwinds, but I think that we have done an exceptional job of demonstrating our ability to challenge that those headwinds and be ready and be prepared for what the future is going to hold. Our expectation is regardless of what happens with some of the current FTC reviews and things that are out with some of our customers, there's a good opportunity, a great opportunity in front of us either direction. We also believe that we have a lot of runway left in just our core businesses, our platform, our investment thesis. We covered a lot on today's call. Margin performance, we still believe we have room to manage that and room to grow, and even with these headwinds we're able to demonstrate that. Q2 and Q3 historically are slower quarters, and you combine a couple of these challenges and you see it looks disproportional, but it's not. We don't see anything that is systemic or causes concern for any type of long-term trends or anything. And I'd just like to leave everybody on the call saying that we're excited about what we see in the future. We're excited about the movement forward in the market, we're excited about potential on the M&A front. We're excited about other opportunities we have in terms of the way we manage and run our business. So, we come off of this quarter, excited for the next and the ones after that and we appreciate the time you all take to spend a few minutes with us and learn a little bit more about the company. With that, I will say thank you and goodbye.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Dan Galves. Thank you, Mr. Galves. You may begin.\nDan Galves: Thanks, Kat. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Mobileye\u2019s fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call for the period ending December 30, 2023. Please note that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the business environment as we currently see it. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the accompanying press release which includes additional information on the specific factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Additionally, on this call, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP figures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is provided in our posted earnings release. Joining us on the call today are Professor Amnon Shashua, Mobileye\u2019s CEO and President, and Moran Shemesh, Mobileye\u2019s CFO. Also joining today for the Q&A session is Nimrod Nehushtan, Mobileye\u2019s Executive Vice President of Strategy and Business Development. Thanks, and now I'll turn the call over to Amnon.\nAmnon Shashua: Thanks, Dan. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining our earnings call. Starting with our results in Q4, they were in line with the press release we provided on January 4th and with the prior guide, so no surprises here. At a high level, Q4 was a strong quarter in terms of revenue growth of 13% and adjusted operating income growth of 14%. We are pleased with the sequential growth and SuperVision volumes and we expect to see continued excellent growth in that product in 2024. I\u2019d also call attention to our operating expenses, which were significantly lower than what we expected in 2023, much of which relates to transitory issues, but also some of which captures efficiencies that should benefit our cost structure over the long term. Looking ahead, the guidance we provided today is unchanged from the outlook we provided in early January. The inventory correction that is impacting the first half of the year has been well publicized. While we did not learn of this build up until late in the year, we believe we have our arms around this issue and the clear out plan. We have implemented additional processes to more closely monitor shipments versus demand. And we believe we have good visibility into how to put this behind us and get back to normalized revenue in the back half of 2024. Moran will provide some additional cover. Switching gears, as we close out 2023 and come out of CES, it's a good time to remind you of our high level strategy and assess the progress made. Our strategy is very simple. Our products were in about 40% of auto production in 2023 and the higher percentage of vehicles would aid us. We can continue to grow that in the coming years as a bigger and bigger percentage of cars are equipped with some level of driving assist technology. But the more important growth driver is average revenue per vehicle, driven by our advanced portfolio products. SuperVision, Chauffeur and Drive would generate much higher average system prices than our core ADAS products. Events and progress in 2023 gave us more confidence than ever that a very large market for these advanced products is developing, and that our technology and business model makes us best positioned to enable and win in that market. On the industry segment itself, we see three clear distinct value propositions that we expect will drive consumer demand and turn into a very -- into a new, very large automotive TAM. Number one is a meaningful improvement in safety, related to the surround cameras that are a must on the next generation of eyes-on, hands-free, Level 2 plus systems like our SuperVision platform. It is underappreciated that in addition to the convenience of hands-free driving, the 360 degree perception can support a step change in safety. Current single camera systems don't support the many evasive maneuvers that can limit accidents, like merging into an open lane to avoid a rear-end collision or avoid vehicles running red lights. Number two is the higher productivity for the car owner. Eyes-off systems like Chauffeur can offer valuable time back to the car owner. If the operational design domain is only 80% to 90% of the time, this is seen as very high value by automakers. Number three is turning vehicles into highly utilized resources. This corresponds to our fully autonomous Drive product. We'll be able to offer self-driving systems for lower than the annual cost of a driver. This unlocks an ability for our customers to generate revenue at a much lower operating cost per mile and with no need to pay or find drivers. We believe these value propositions align perfectly with our advanced product portfolio. And there was much evidence in 2023 to support our view that those products are the highest performing, most scalable and lowest cost available options in the market. At a high level, all the industry trends were in our direction. The pace of innovation really picked up in China and the pressure on OEM capital efficiency rose. These both are pushing global OEMs to focus more on [programmatic] (ph) issues like time to market, cost and performance, exactly where Mobileye has advantages. At the same time, we launched the ZEEKR SuperVision software to high praise which was significant proof point. Finally we recently brought to our customers a collaboration framework called DXP that enables the automaker to control the driving experience of a SuperVision or Chauffeur based system. Finding sweet spot that enables the OEMs to control the look and feel of the system but rely on our core technologies for all the objective and safety critical aspects is already paying dividends with customers. On a more specific basis, we announced the value of our 2023 design wins at CES two weeks ago. Future projected revenue was $7 billion for the second year in a row. This compares to our 2023 revenue of $2 billion. Implied ASP of these agreements was $122 in 2023, $105 in 2022. This compares to ASP for 2021 design wins of $65 and ASP of our actual revenue in 2023 of $53. The volume associated with the design wins the last two years is $60 million plus compared to mid-$30 million today. Beyond the design wins, 2023 was an important year for execution, customer acquisition and expansion of OEMs in the opportunity set. Our SuperVision system is now on more than 190,000 vehicles. We delivered the full highway software in August and it's providing to be a highly capable system -- it's proving to be a highly capable system and we have expanded design domain to 22 cities from only two back in September. We believe that proving ourselves in what is the most challenging environment for Mobileye, given data restrictions, proves our global scale and that's unique selling point that is underappreciated. We were awarded SuperVision design wins with Porsche, FAW, Mahindra and a major western OEM over the course of 2023. The number of models included in all our design wins are now projected at 30 models as compared to nine models at the beginning of 2023. Our portfolio strategy where SuperVision serves as a bridge to Chauffeur is being proven out as Polestar (NASDAQ:PSNY), FAW and a multi-brand major western OEM, all awarded production programs on the Chauffeur platform during 2023. We diversified the business significantly during 2023 from mostly Chinese OEMs and mostly electric vehicles to a diverse set of OEMs, price points, and powertrain types. The most important catalyst was the landmark design win to bring our entire product set to a major western OEM. It's the first global OEM to align behind our complete portfolio, especially mirroring their future intelligent driving product development plan to our portfolio. It more than doubles the number of vehicle models in the pipeline and spans across all markets and powertrain types. And the endorsement of this automaker will be high value in terms of closing additional deals. We were successful in moving many OEMs into our business development funnel as the high-level trends I described earlier increased the sense of urgency in the marketplace and the confidence in our solutions. We now have design wins or are in advanced discussions with 11 OEMs representing 37% of industry production as compared to three OEMs representing 9% of industry production as of the start of 2023. In summary, we know of no other competitor in the ADAS-AV space with a similar breadth of design wins that has actual navigate on-pilot systems in production and has production programs for eyes-off systems with multiple automakers. Overall, as we have shared previously, we do not expect 2024 financial results to be where we want them to be, given the inventory correction. But we expect to leverage all the groundwork laid in 2022 and 2023 to take a leap forward in terms of visibility toward the next leg of our growth story. I'll now turn the call over to Moran.\nMoran Shemesh: Thank you, Amnon, and thanks for joining the call, everyone. Before I begin, please be aware that all my comments on profitability will refer to non-GAAP measurements. The primary exclusion in Mobileye\u2019s non-GAAP numbers is amortization of intangible assets, which is mainly related to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)'s acquisition of Mobileye in 2017. We also exclude stock-based compensation. Starting with Q4 results, we had another very good quarter with revenue up 13% year-over-year, adjusted operating income up 14%, and adjusted operating margin at 39%. SuperVision volumes were 38,000 units in Q4, up from 29,000 in Q3. The 67,000 units we did in the second half was significantly higher than 35,000 in the first half. Operating expenses were again meaningfully below expectations, about $30 million this quarter. There were two main areas, each about the same magnitude. Favorable expenses were lower due to favorable ethics and due to some reimbursement for employees on military reserve duty. The other factor was higher than expected engineering reimbursement for pre-designed win activities with certain OEMs. Over the course of 2023, our operating margin rose from 27% to 39% on sequentially higher revenue and consistent operating expenses. Obviously, this is a backward-looking, but it should give investors some sense of the operating leverage possible once more meaningful SuperVision and Chauffeur volumes start to drive revenue significantly higher. On a cashflow basis, we generated almost $400 million of operating cashflow in fiscal year 2023. And it's important to note that we invested around $200 million in rebuilding the safety buffer of EyeQ chips on our own balance sheet. We expect to maintain a consistent level of balance sheet inventory in 2024. Capital expenditure were just below $100 million for the year, in line with our prior comments. Looking ahead, you are all aware that as part of the process of setting order schedules for Q1 and the remainder of 2024, we learned that there is 6 million to 7 million units of excess inventory of EyeQ chips at our customers. We understand that much of this excess inventory reflects decisions by Tier 1 customers to build inventory in the basic ADAS category due to supply chain constraints and a desire to avoid part shortages in 2021 and 2022, as well as lower than expected production in certain OEMs during 2023. The inventory situation is related to the base ADAS business only, as SuperVision inventory is at normal level. As we noted in our January 4th press release and 8-K, we expect Q1 revenue to be down approximately 50% to around $230 million. We expect EyeQ volume to be around $3.4 million units in Q1. We expect SuperVision in the low 30,000 unit range, reflecting normal seasonality in China. Given the unusually low EyeQ volume, SuperVision will be a larger portion of revenues in Q1, which will result in gross margin in the mid-60 range. Extracting our operating expenses, which will likely be a bit higher than the recent $200 million run rate, the outlook for Q1 adjusted operating income is for a loss of $65 million to $80 million. But we see revenue and volume snapping back fairly quickly and believe we have very good visibility on this. Due to the nature of our business, all of this inventory is for specific OEMs and production of specific vehicle platforms. The process to clear the inventory is simply to stop shipping chips for specific vehicles and have our customer use the existing inventory to satisfy demand. There is no uncertainty regarding who the customers are, there is no alternative product that can be used, and there is no discounting or other economic action needed to clear the inventory. As we compare our prospective shipment with vehicle production schedule, we believe approximately 5 million units can be cleared in Q1 and the vast majority of the remainder in Q2. In terms of our full year guidance, it is unchanged from the preliminary outlook we provided in January 4th, and our visibility has improved over the last several weeks. From a volume perspective, we are assuming 31 million to 32 million EyeQ shipments and 175,000 to 195,000 SuperVision shipments in 2024. We expect the cadence of EyeQs assuming the midpoint of the guidance to be around [$3.4 million] (ph) in Q1, an increase of at least 100% in Q2 versus Q1, and then the balance of unit shipments in the second half of the year. We believe that this cadence, based on our analysis and discussions with customers, should result in a vast majority of excess on the inventory to be cleared by the middle of 2024. We expect average system price to increase in 2024 as compared to 2023 due to an increase of SuperVision as a percentage of total revenue. In terms of gross margin, we look at it on a product by product basis. On the ADAS side, we expect a slight down tick in growth margin this year for two reasons. One, as you know, the cost of EyeQ chips from our supplier went up at the beginning of 2023. We passed that along to our customers. However, there were a decent number of units in 2023 where we generated revenue at 2023 prices, but used [cheaper chips] (ph) in 2022 costs. That's a minor headwind this year. We are also assuming some continued normalization of production mix after a very rich mix during the supply chain crisis. We expect these two headwinds to be partially offset by higher cloud-enhanced ADAS volume and REM recurring revenue. Regarding SuperVision, the optimized domain controller is now in production. This comes at a meaningfully lower cost and we are sharing a portion of that with our customers. ASP will be down a bit compared to last year but we expect gross margin to be up meaningfully to low 40% as of Q2 2024 as compared to low to mid 30% in 2023. In addition, we would expect some level of software licensing revenue to begin making an impact in Q4 of this year once the ZEEKR free trials are over. Any consumer that chooses to pay for the SuperVision-based feature after the free trial will drive incremental revenue and profit for Mobileye. With respect to operating expenses, we are assuming 20% increase over the final 2023 number on an adjusted basis, excluding amortization of intangible asset and stock-based compensation. The OpEx bears a bit more discussion. Our forecast for 2024 is unchanged from what we projected several months ago and not too far above our original forecast for 2023. Much of the lower cost in 2023 related to more transitory things like foreign exchange and delayed moving to our new campus, good news on some engineering reimbursement and reimbursement of certain payroll costs for employees on military reserves. But some of it is structural. Certain adjustment to the way we collaborate with OEMs, including [ASP] (ph), means that SuperVision and Chauffeur programs can scale more efficiently than we originally envisioned. The refinement of our mobility-as-a-service strategy to focus on supplying the self-driving system leads to structurally lower costs, but we don't believe a reduction in the opportunity. Bottom line is that we do believe our operating expenses in the near and long term should be structurally lower than we expected as of a year ago. We continue to believe that OpEx percentage growth in 2025 and beyond should be significantly lower than in 2024. Lastly, in terms of tax rates, we are assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of between 15% and 17% for 2024 in comparison to 11% in 2023. Thank you and we will now take your questions.\nDan Galves: Thank you, Moran. Kat, if you could compile the Q&A queue, please analysts if you could limit your questions to one main question and one follow-up. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nMark Delaney: Yes, good morning and thanks very much for taking the question. I was hoping to start with an update on the engagements with the OEMs with some of your more advanced solutions like SuperVision and Chauffeur. I think as of the 3Q call, you said you were either booked or in advanced discussions with 10 OEMs. I think, Amnon, you said today that's now at 11, and then I believe there's another four OEMs where there was more preliminary discussions underway. Can you give any more color on how those discussions are going, your general sense of progress? And were any OEMs maybe deciding to go another direction, or do you still feel like you're well positioned with that set of customers?\nAmnon Shashua: Well, SV and Chauffeur are complex systems. So early adopters, they need a lengthy due diligence process. For example, before winning SuperVision on Porsche, we underwent thousands of miles of public road rides in Europe and in the US with a due diligence that took almost a year. But now we are facing the effects of, I would call this the law of innovation of diffusion, which means that more OEMs buy into SuperVision and Chauffeur, the shorter their due diligence phase. So after winning the big western OEM, I believe that due diligence phase is getting much shorter. And we foresee a number of design wins, both in western and in China during 2024. And I believe that the announcement of those design wins would be in the second half of the year.\nMark Delaney: That's helpful. One of the things I was hoping for an update on was the DXP platform. It was a big part of your speech and presentation at CES this year. I imagine you met with a number of current and potential customers at CES. Maybe you can share more around how impactful DXP is and the receptivity of auto OEMs to DXP? And maybe touch a little bit on how DXP is different from EyeQ Kit? Thank you.\nAmnon Shashua: I think that the DXP really solves the problem of how the OEM can own the driving experience in a very efficient manner. So previously before DXP, OEMs would come to us and say, look, we want to take your two EyeQ 6 chips, add another microprocessor, a strong microprocessor that would cost hundreds of dollars and will write our driving policy code on that microprocessor. Or they would come and say that writing our code on your EyeQ 6 chip would create all sorts of clashes because our code and your code, fighting on resources, so we prefer to put it on a separate chip. Now this means that the cost of the system is higher and the economical scalability is very, very important. With DXP, they do not need to add any additional microprocessor. They do not need to write code on our EyeQ 6 chip. They write code on the MCU, and they write high-level code, and they use our infrastructure for writing their driving policy. So it reduces -- it does two things, it reduces the bill of materials of the system because you don't need to add another chip and it allows Mobileye to scale much faster because all the code written on the EyeQ 6 chip is more or less the same for all the platforms. All the differences are in the MCU. Maybe Nimrod wants to add something.\nNimrod Nehushtan: If I may add, we had the opportunity during CES to present this concept to multiple OEMs in dozens of meetings and the reception was very compelling in the sense that although OEMs now have more focus on pragmatic considerations like cost, performance, and time to market, this does not come at the expense of owning the user experience and being able to influence and craft their own kind of user experience for their customer base. And what's really missing in industry to find the sweet spot in between the best performance cost in time to market solution and full flexibility in crafting a unique user experience. And this is where DXP comes in and it is really perceived as a driving operating system by OEMs, which is kind of simplifying the task for OEMs who are now interested in offering new driving experiences in this new generation of driver assist and autonomous driving products.\nDan Galves: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nEmmanuel Rosner: Thank you very much. My first question is around the chip destocking situation that you flagged a few weeks or so ago. Can you maybe just go back over how you became aware of it? How do you get confidence around the magnitude of the issue and the timing of it being resolved in line with what you reiterated today, please?\nAmnon Shashua: I think, Moran?\nMoran Shemesh: Yeah, so as I mentioned in the script, so the inventory buildup issue started actually three years ago, [in mid] (ph) COVID period when global production went down dramatically and the industry was all about the desire to secure production and to go after every chip. That was also the atmosphere for us with the suppliers and also from the sense of urgency that we got from our customers. That of course, we believe, led to some stocking, billing activity. In addition, with related to your question, in 2022 and 2023, actually the ordering process changed. So we needed to make full year commitment to our chief supplier. So we asked our customers to do the same and make full year commitment for this year in both 2022 and 2023, which led to less ability from their side to adjust purchases to demand as they did it pre-COVID period. So adjusting again the quantities was impossible actually in 2023. In 2023, we know the supply chain crisis largely was over but it was still unclear when will global production get back to normal to pre-COVID levels, which might be the reason that the Tier 1s kept holding this inventory through the year. They were also, again, obligated with commitments, but they held it through the year and we weren't informed of such quantity. Over the course of 2023, we believe that our core customers underperformed in terms of production for our top customers, which make the majority of our ADAS customers, they grew 4% versus the overall market growing of 9%. And then towards the end of the year, when the commitments were ending, and now in 2024 we got back to normal in terms of orders, so we have quarterly orders and customers can adjust to the quarterly, we think that's the reason it came up towards the end of 2023 and not at the beginning of the year or some other time during this period.\nEmmanuel Rosner: Understood. That is helpful. And then just a quick one on SuperVision. I guess as part of this update a few weeks or so ago, you also sort of tweaked down expectations for SuperVision units in 2024. I think part of it was maybe an exercise in de-risking around like timing launches. Could you provide us sort of similar type of de-risking around what the trajectory looks like beyond 2024? Obviously, launches have generally sort of happened a little bit later than expected, at CES about a year or so ago. So just want to make sure that investor expectations are properly calibrated for what's beyond 2024 in the ramp-up initially when you only have sort of a few initial customers.\nAmnon Shashua: Yeah, At the beginning of 2023, we had a small number of car models and it's difficult to make accurate forecasts. Today, we have 30 car models and we can improve our forecasts. For 2023, in production we had two car models in China to base our forecast and all what we had to rely on was OEM numbers which turned out to be optimistic. Now we know that most of the production of SuperVision is coming out in 2026. By 2025, we'll have between nine to 11 models of SuperVision. Now the five models from the Geely Group, two from ZEEKR, one from Smart, one from Polestar, one from Volvo (OTC:VLVLY), and then between four to six car models from the FAW. So that's the production in 2024 and 2025. And then in 2026, we have Porsche and we have the big western OEM with 17 car models and we have Mahindra.\nDan Galves: And just one follow up from me, this is Dan. In terms of calibration, for the leading edge analysts that have calibrated their models and estimates to the tracking document that we provided at CES, as well as their own updated analysis, these estimates look reasonable and achievable to us. Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Levy from Barclays. Please proceed.\nDan Levy: Hi. Good afternoon to you. Thank you for taking questions. I wanted to start with just tying to your comments about the engagements with 11 OEMs, I think broadly there is this narrative out there that, like you said, automakers do want to own technology, but the challenge is it's been very difficult to scale and there's a notable example of a North American automaker that is pulling back on some of their more advanced ADAS plans given some struggles there. So to what extent are you seeing more engagement with automakers that despite the desire to own the technology really are coming to the realization that they have no choice but to come to you because you are the easiest and fastest way to scale? To what extent are you seeing automakers come around to you?\nNimrod Nehushtan: Yeah, I'll take it. So I think what we are seeing is this domino effect that in one sense it is becoming a realization in the industry that the next few years are going to be very heavily influenced by OEM's ability to offer these products that offer hands-free driving, eyes-off driving, and it is going to become a more -- a growingly more important feature for consumers. And this is what gives rise to the sense of urgency amongst OEMs to create the shortest path they can for a high quality product. And maybe a few years ago, it was still -- OEMs had the perception that they have some time to invest and they can take the longer path to get there while still owning the technology stack. Now the clock is ticking for them and they are looking for the kind of the best performance at the shortest time to market so that they can compete. And we already see this dynamic happening in China and it's growing outside of China already today. So we do see more and more traction from OEMs who were maybe in the past more bullish on owning the technology stack who have come to a realization that they need to at least find a parallel path inside their company to de-risk the activity towards the next generation of ADAS products. So a certain portion of our engagements are with OEMs who have invested significantly in the past in in-house activities. Can say that.\nAmnon Shashua: I can say a lot of it that it's really a flywheel effect. A few years ago, the only reference to such a system was the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Autopilot and FSD. Now you have Chinese automakers with systems of a similar setup and those Chinese automakers are also -- some of the models are being exported to the West and those are mobilized systems. Now they know that Porsche and the big western OEM are also going to introduce these systems. So it creates a flywheel effect. And as an OEM, you need to cater to the rising competition in terms of intelligent driving. So this creates more and more incentive to start working with Mobileye on these advanced products, whether instead of their in-house development or in parallel to their in-house development.\nDan Levy: Great. Thank you. As a follow-up, somewhat related, maybe you could just provide us with an update on the competitive landscape in China and appreciate that some of the earlier engagements you've had with SuperVision are based on China but we also know that China is the market where there is right now the most rapid development cycle. There are also data barriers within China. So to what extent are you -- maybe you could talk about share trends or win rates in China. And to what extent are you as competitive in China as you are in the West?\nAmnon Shashua: Okay, so actually it's going to be a lengthy answer, so bear with me. It's really a complicated landscape. So I'll start with West. With the western OEMs, we have about 90% share in eight out of the 10 biggest OEMs. This is true not only today, but given all the design wins to date, this is true for the foreseeable future. Actually, given all the current design wins, our market share is growing. Now in China, there are a number of OEMs where we have above 90% market share, including some local OEMs like Chery. There are also some local OEMs where we have around 30%, and some which we do not have a relationship yet. So for example, at BYD (SZ:002594), we have 30% market share, and with Changan, we have zero. So Chinese OEMs growth is faster than our market share growth. BYD and Changan are growing fast. Now in terms of competition, there's the low-end and high-end. At the low-end ADAS, we have some supplier competing at the very low-end solutions, very low cost, very low-end solutions. And at the high-end, we have the in-house development of OEMs. So at the low end, competing systems suffer from a large performance gap on the very basic features like autonomous emergency braking, for example. The performance will never pass any Western regulator. For them to catch up, they'll need to have more expensive system which will reduce their competitive offering. Moreover, we are adding REM to the low-end ADAS to provide a cloud-enhanced system and Chery just announced that in two months, car models with Mobileye Cloud Enhanced solution will be launched. This will add more pressure on our competitors by creating a moving target for single camera ADAS. For the high-end systems, those are developed in-house by some OEMs, there are still significant proof points to pass, I'll say along three axis. There's geographic scalability, performance scalability, and economic scalability. So geographic-wise, there is this move from highway to urban. This is a big challenge because high definition maps provided by map makers are done manually, do not scale to urban. Mobileye has REM. This is a big advantage. Also, geographic-wise, OEMs want to export systems outside of China and meet regulation. Mobileye has an advantage there. Performance wise, the goal is to move from eyes on to eyes off. This is a significant step-up in performance and focus on safety. Mobileye has an advantage there. Economical wise, in-house systems are more expensive and require more sensors to reach a reasonable performance level. Mobileye has an advantage there. So, Chinese, I think the Chinese market is the most interesting and dynamic market to date. And I think we're doing well there and our market share will grow but the growth of the market is faster than our growth of the market share and I hope we'll catch up soon.\nDan Levy: Thank you.\nDan Galves: Thank you, Dan. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Itay Michaeli from Citi. Please proceed.\nItay Michaeli: Great. Thanks, everybody. Good afternoon. Just two quick questions for me on the pipeline. First, hoping you can kind of dimension what portion of the pipeline is both looking at SuperVision and Chauffeur combined, just given the momentum you've seen with Chauffeur recently? And second question, since the big announcement at CES, have you seen an increase in activity and conversations, including maybe with the second wave OEMs you described in the last earnings call?\nAmnon Shashua: Yes, Nimrod will take it.\nNimrod Nehushtan: Yeah, so regarding the first question, it depends. In some of the engagements we have, we have parallel engagements for both SuperVision and Chauffeur with the same OEM. This is in the case where the OEMs are interested in a few car models with which maybe they want to have different offerings for different segments in the market, different price levels of cars. On the other hand, there are some OEMs who might be more interested in specific product offering and maybe to start from Chauffeur or to focus on hands-off for their cars because of whatever considerations they have. So we can say we have a mixed bag of engagements in general. We see a good mixture of both Chauffeur and SuperVision in our pipeline engagement. And I think regarding -- what was your second question, please? You can just repeat?\nItay Michaeli: Just since CES, any increase in activity and engagement with the second wave?\nNimrod Nehushtan: Yeah, so I think one of the interesting outcomes of CES is that we have had just over a couple of weeks after CES, we already have, I think, three engagements within our pipeline that specifically want to focus on evaluating DXP hands on, to actually start working technically on DXP, to start experimenting with it, to start feeling the tools, seeing how they can influence the driving experience. And this is just after a couple of weeks since we have announced it for the first time. So it is a very promising start to this promotion process that we are executing.\nItay Michaeli: Perfect. That's very helpful. Thank you.\nDan Galves: Thanks, Itay. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Spak from UBS. Please proceed.\nJoe Spak: Thanks everyone. You talked a lot about the progress on the SuperVision program wins. I was wondering if you could shed a little bit of light on how -- when you have those conversations with customers, how they think about implementation on those programs or take rates? Like, are they convinced they can charge for these features or, Amnon, you mentioned that as you sort of get to more higher end features like Chauffeur where you get time back, maybe do we need features like that to see -- to really see significantly higher levels of adoption and willingness to pay?\nAmnon Shashua: Well we have -- in the West we have a reference and that's the cost of Tesla FSD. This is why it's so important to have a very economical, very low cost system to allow the car maker flexibility in pricing. Now, Mobileye system with the sensors is less than $2,000. So, this gives the OEM lots of flexibility in pricing considering that the Tesla FSD is $12,000 to the end customers. So, most of our engagements, the system is a standard fit. So it's not with a take rate calculation, but it comes on every and every car. So this is the situation right now.\nJoe Spak: Thank you. And then just the second one, you mentioned, just with respect to the inventory bill that occurred, you mentioned that you're implementing some procedures to put in place to make sure you keep better track of sell-through. Can you talk a little bit more about what you're doing there, or is this really just -- you mentioned also that over the past couple years you went to full year commitment. So have you sort of pulled back on full year commitments? Is that part of that procedure?\nMoran Shemesh: Yeah. So I'll take it. So first of all, of course, I must say that we never experienced the situation before as our customers have done all through the 10 plus years period a very good job in ordering the demand. Given the recent history and the inventory issue, of course we are taking action in several fronts to add capabilities to monitoring of shipment versus demand. So the first thing that you mentioned, yeah, the order process is now back to normal. So commitment for 12 months is no longer relevant. So the commitment is only a quarter ahead. So we do get forecast, 12 month forecast, but that's just a forecast. It's not a commitment. So the same thing with our suppliers. So again, the industry and it\u2019s what we've been saying, that the 12 month commitment is no longer relevant in 2024 and we don't expect it to be relevant also in the future as it was specific to COVID. We will also try to receive some input from our customers on inventory level, but it's not that something that we have visibility to, it's important to mention. In terms of actions, we're taking internally. So we have established a regular process to match shipments to detailed vehicle production, both looking backwards and forward. We are putting more focus on market-based forecast that incorporate the adoption rate and OEM share trends. We always have used and updated the forecast and compared to the market, but we will now put more weight on this as another input of the customer provided forecast. We will also consider working with external vendors to build some statistical model forecast to incorporate macro level data and additional headcount to support this. But that's what we -- that\u2019s the steps that we are taking.\nJoe Spak: Okay. Thank you very much.\nMoran Shemesh: Another clarification that Dan mentioned, it wasn't clear in my script. So the full guidance for 2024 hasn't changed from January 4th. So for EyeQ we are anticipating 31 million to 33 million units of EyeQ shipment. A clarification since the line was down a bit. Thanks.\nDan Galves: Thank you, Moran. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho Securities. Please proceed.\nVijay Rakesh: Just a quick question on the company landscape again. I think -- and obviously Mobileye is doing very well in the Western hemisphere, I think, especially with CARIAD gone and GM Cruise having problems as well. But in China, are you seeing -- there's been some concerns on potentially NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) gaining share. Any thoughts on that? What's driving that? Is that any price performance or just OEMs trying to diversify? Can you talk to what you're seeing there?\nAmnon Shashua: I think in China, I mentioned the in-house development in China. Those systems, they have significant proof points to still undergo. And I said about geographic scalability, economic scalability, performance scalability. On the economical side these systems are way more expensive than our system. For example, on NIO they have four Orin chips. Orin is NVIDIA owned and is a very expensive chip and they have four of them and they have ladders for reaching and the performance level is not even reaching the performance level of SuperVision. This is on the economical side. On the geographical side, the big game now is going from highway to urban. HD maps are not scaling to Urban. It's not economically scalable. None of those in-house developments claim that they'll be using high definition maps in Urban. Some of them are claiming they'll go mapless. Good luck for them. Some of them say they'll only provide the commute feature where you record your normal commute and you'll get performance only on that route. Mobileye has REMs. And also they want to export outside of China. There's all sorts of regulations that Mobileye is very good at. So that's also an advantage. So geographic performance, you want to go to eyes-off. This is the -- the holy grail of all of this is an eyes-off system. Their safety is paramount. You cannot just provide a system that you feel comfortable, but you can have all sorts of safety issues there because the driver is responsible. In an eyes-off system, there are no discounts. You have to be perfect. This also adds an advantage to Mobileye. So I think China is very dynamic which I think is a very good thing, competitive-wise and moving forward very fast with the technology. We like that very much. And I think the OEMs that are doing in-house development now are keeping all their options open. So for example, ZEEKR, they have an in-house development and they're working also with Mobileye. We have long visibility to the continuation of work with ZEEKR.\nVijay Rakesh: Got it. And just another question on SuperVision. Obviously, there is good ramp there, but as you look out through \u201825, \u201826, can you talk to what kind of conservatism you're embedding either on the OEM unit side or on the number of OEMs, I guess, as you build that outlook on the SuperVision side?\nAmnon Shashua: Yeah, so I mentioned that previously. So, in 2024, there are going to be five car models all from the Geely Group. Two of ZEEKR, Smart, Volvo, and Polestar, four. And then starting end of 2024, beginning of 2025, four to six FAW car models would be added. And then the big jump is in 2026, where we have Porsche, we have the 17 models of -- car models of the western -- big western OEM, and we have Mahindra in China. And in all cases\u2026\nNimrod Nehushtan: India.\nAmnon Shashua: Mahindra in India. And in all cases, we're talking about the standard fit.\nVijay Rakesh: Got it. Great, thank you so much.\nDan Galves: Just to follow up, Vijay, yeah, we want to be more conservative, right? And this is why we provided more of a tracking document with the number of models, the OEMs, the launch dates for analysts to make their own estimates for these years. And like we said before, kind of the analysts that have calibrated to this and adjusted their forecasts, we see those as reasonable and achievable. So thank you. Next question, please. Kat, are there additional questions?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Luke Junk from Baird. Please proceed.\nLuke Junk: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. First question, you stated in the prepared remarks that EyeQ visibility has improved in recent weeks. Just hoping you can expand on what is better understood sitting here in late January.\nAmnon Shashua: I think the visibility is better understood.\nMoran Shemesh: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So first of all, I mean, based on the shipment schedule for 2024 and the information that we have on specific inventory levels from our own research and based on also on customers' input. So we of course reviewed the detailed production forecast and as we mentioned we expect the majority of the excess inventory should be cleared by the end of Q1 with most of the rest clearing in Q2. Of course, actual production levels of per OEM customers will play a role. But based on our projection, again we believe the excess inventory will be fully cleared by year end. At the end of the day, we had a very true analysis of again, ADAS [self-treatment] (ph) rate and lower production per OEM to understand that in order to meet the production of this year, that's what we need to provide, of course, taking into account the inventory issue. So we have better visibility. We also, of course, we've mentioned Q1, we have also some visibility to Q2 that we said will be at least 100% higher than Q1. So yeah, and for the rest of the year, again, in line with production expectation and the analysis and what we got from our customers, that's where we think we're going to land.\nDan Galves: Thanks, Moran. I'll just follow up with a couple of things because we've been obviously looking very closely. So the visibility since January 4th has improved because we have commitments for Q1. We know what the -- generally what the volume is going to be in Q1. We have more visibility in terms of Q2 starting to adjust into commitment. So that's why we have the confidence to say that Q2 will be at least 100% higher than Q1. And then in terms of the back half, we have the indications from the Tier 1s and these kind of match up with kind of the market-based forecast that we're looking at as well. So overall, we feel good about kind of the visibility towards the 31 million to 33 million units of EyeQ volume in 2024 and that, that level of production will or that level of shipments will result in the elimination of the excess inventory almost completely by the middle of the year and then potentially with a little bit left in the back half.\nLuke Junk: Understood. Thanks for that, Dan. And then my follow-up question, hoping you could comment on some of the key facets of the anticipated expense growth in 2024. In particular, there's been certainly an increasing focus on the AI-related facets of driving policy development. I think it would just be clarifying to understand how Mobileye is investing incrementally in Generative AI tools this year? Thank you.\nAmnon Shashua: Our OpEx growth is mostly devoted on our desire to execute all these programs in SuperVision. The [Porsche] (ph), the western OEM, all of those are converging to 2026 to continue supporting ZEEKR, of course with the many OTAs that are going forward. Our move from a Tier 2 to Tier 1 with Porsche and the western OEM, we\u2019re acting as a Tier 1 supplier. In some other cases, we\u2019re acting as a Tier 1.5, but all of this requires more resources to support this in a very good way. As of using AI, this does not need growth. This is our normal activity with the existing manpower that we have. It is more moving from a Tier 2 to Tier 1 and supporting so many car models that are coming out in production in the next few years that requires some growth.\nMoran Shemesh: Yeah. Of course, the headcount cost increases, again, a few tens of millions relates to the higher number of employees and maybe more enhanced salary raises and also the savings that we had in 2023. We need to recall in Q4 we had some reimbursement for military service. These are not things that necessarily will happen in 2024. Also the ILS effect, Israeli Shekel effect in 2023. Besides that, we have also significant facilities growth of a few tens of millions. We're moving to the new campus. The [appreciation] (ph) there is approximately $20 million higher, so also in terms of facilities. And besides that also our EyeQ platform, EyeQ 6 and EyeQ 7, our Radar product as we approach 2025. Also in the Lidar domain, we have some growth in 2024.\nLuke Junk: Thank you.\nDan Galves: Thank you. Thanks, Luke. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris McNally from Evercore. Please proceed.\nChris McNally: Thanks so much, Amnon. Thanks team. So maybe just some quick math, [batting] (ph), cleanup here on the ADAS hand. So I think previously, Mobileye has discussed 50%, \u201821 penetration for the industry moving to about 75%, \u201825, \u201826. This seems slightly pushed out now looking at \u201825 or \u201826, something like in the low or mid 60% penetration. So first, can we talk about industry adoption on base ADAS? And then second, around global market share, Amnon, you discussed lower share on maybe some of the domestics of China share maybe 50% or below. Is it fair to see your 65% to 70% historical share maybe move to this kind of, I don't know, 64%, 65% on that mix effect over the next couple of years? So any new high level math that you could provide us on industry [chips] (ph), sort of later in the decade would be really helpful.\nAmnon Shashua: I think on the western OEMs, our market share is continuing to grow. Just based on all the design wins that we had in 2023 and 2022, we are growing our market share. As I said before, eight of the 10 biggest OEMs, we have more than 90% market share. With China, the growth of the Chinese OEMs is faster than the growth of our market share. So our market share there is reducing naturally. As I mentioned before, Changan is growing very, very fast and we have zero -- we have no relationship with Changan. BYD is growing very fast. We have only 30% market share with BYD. But we are continuing to win, to get design wins, and both the low end ADAS and the high end ADAS like SuperVision. So we will see how the market share in China will play out in the next few years, but now it's really an unstable position because the market is going very, very fast.\nNimrod Nehushtan: If I may add, I think that if you refer to a correction to the market share calculation based on the inventory levels, we really think that the inventory levels that we've disclosed were accumulated over a period of time that is longer than a year, likely closer to three years. So if you kind of try to compound what will be the effect for the annual volumes that we have disclosed, it's more about a $2 million reduction per year on average, which accounts for maybe 1%, 2% of the market share calculation that we've had in the past. So we don't think that this indicates for a significant change in our market share forecast on a global level.\nChris McNally: All makes sense on the explanation on market share. Maybe if we can go back to that industry adoption, sort of when will we hit on a global basis, 75% penetration? Obviously some of those western players, Amnon, have been pretty slow to make standard fit, obviously outside of  Toyota  (NYSE:TM). But any view on what is sort of a ballpark year we can think about industry ADAS penetration being around 75%?\nAmnon Shashua: From external sources, this is the number that is being projected till the end of the decade, 75% market share of ADAS. We have no reason to believe this is going to change.\nDan Galves: Even possibly higher. And I think that India is an area where we see a lot of growth. So the western markets are fairly well penetrated, probably above 70%. But there's still some growth there. But I think a market like India, which is maybe single digit ADAS penetration, but the systems that have been on the road in production the last couple of years have been extremely successful. So now everybody's trying to kind of catch up and we have a very good position there. So I think that that's going to be a good market for ADAS adoption as well as our share over the next couple of years.\nNimrod Nehushtan: If I may add, we do see also -- we do see in the last year, we did start to see a growing pull from regulatory bodies in emerging markets in order to kind of start promoting the adoption [ADAS] (ph) systems in new markets like South America, India as Dan mentioned. In addition, in Europe and the United States, there is a move towards mandating safety systems for vehicle production. This started just recently in Europe with GSR, which is not just a kind of a bonus feature, it's a mandate in order to sell cars. So these two driving forces are what we think will push the industry towards higher adoption rates within the next few years.\nChris McNally: Thank you.\nDan Galves: Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to Dan Galves for closing comments.\nDan Galves: Thank you, Kat, for managing the call. Thanks to the management team of Mobileye and thanks to everyone for joining. We'll talk to you next quarter. Thank you.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

        "article_content": " \n\nIn their fourth-quarter earnings call, McCormick (NYSE:MKC) & Company, Inc. (MKC) revealed a mixed performance with top-line results falling short of expectations, citing shifts in consumer behavior and an increased search for value. Despite this, the company reported a 3% increase in sales, partly buoyed by favorable currency impacts. However, volume and product mix saw a 3% decline. McCormick's net income rose to $0.85 per share from $0.73 in the prior year, attributed to gross margin expansion and joint venture results. The company's operational cash flow significantly improved, and they returned substantial capital to shareholders. Looking ahead, McCormick is focused on driving volume growth and expects to see an improved financial position by the end of 2024, with projected constant currency net sales ranging from a 1% decline to 1% growth. The company is confident in its strategies to improve volumes, margin recovery, and long-term profitable growth.\nMcCormick's efforts to optimize pricing and manage price gaps have led to recapturing buyers and driving profitable volume growth in certain product lines. The company's strategy includes narrowing price gaps, increasing promotions, and securing distribution wins. New products and expanded distribution have also contributed to sales growth, and McCormick plans to continue investing in brand marketing in 2024.\nThe company's CEO outlined five priorities for the upcoming year, aiming to strengthen global leadership, drive profitable growth, accelerate digital transformation, elevate people culture, and strengthen competitive advantages. With a comprehensive approach to managing their business, McCormick remains committed to long-term objectives and delivering profitable growth.\nIn light of McCormick & Company's recent earnings call, several metrics and insights from InvestingPro can provide a deeper understanding of the company's financial health and future prospects. According to InvestingPro data, McCormick's market capitalization stands at $18.52 billion, reflecting the company's sizable presence in the industry. The P/E ratio, a measure of the company's current share price relative to its per-share earnings, is 26.62, with a slightly more favorable adjusted P/E ratio for the last twelve months as of Q4 2023 at 25.37. This indicates that investors have high expectations of future earnings growth compared to the broader market.\nThe company's revenue growth over the last twelve months was 4.91%, a modest increase that aligns with McCormick's reported sales increase in their earnings call. This growth rate, while not exceptional, does suggest a level of resilience in their business model, particularly in the face of shifting consumer behaviors.\nInvestingPro Tips highlight that McCormick has a commendable track record of raising its dividend for 38 consecutive years and maintaining dividend payments for 53 consecutive years, which could be a reassuring sign for income-focused investors. However, it's worth noting that three analysts have revised their earnings downwards for the upcoming period, which might raise concerns about future profitability. Additionally, the company's short-term obligations exceeding its liquid assets could indicate potential liquidity challenges.\nInvestingPro subscribers have access to additional tips and insights that could further inform investment decisions.

This is Faten Freiha, VP of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining today's Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. To accompany this call, we posted a set of slides on our IR website, ir.mccormick.com. With me this morning are Brendan Foley, President and CEO; Mike Smith, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Kasey Jenkins, Chief Growth Officer. During this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. The nature of those non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning's press release and slides. In our comments, certain percentages are rounded. Please refer to our presentation for complete information. Today's presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or other factors. Please refer to our forward-looking statements on Slide 2 for more information. I will now turn the discussion over to Brendan.\nBrendan Foley: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Let me start by sharing what we will cover in the morning's call. I will begin with an overview of our fourth quarter year-over-year results, focusing on top-line drivers. Next, I will briefly reflect on our full year 2023 performance and share our plans and building blocks to improve volume in 2024. Mike will then go into more depth on the fourth quarter financial results and the details of our 2024 financial outlook. And finally, before your questions, I will share some closing comments, including our key priorities as I begin my first full year as CEO. Turning now to our results on Slide 4. I want to start by acknowledging that our top-line results for the fourth quarter did not meet our expectations, as volume trends decelerated relative to the third quarter. There was greater-than-expected pressure on the consumer that drove changes in their behavior, which impacted our growth. We did, however, see sequential improvement in several key areas within our portfolio, underscoring that our strategies and initiatives are working, as I will highlight in a moment. That said, we do recognize that consumers are exhibiting even more value-seeking behavior, they are increasing shopping trips, reducing basket size and making just-in-time purchases, creating further uncertainty in the consumer environment. I want to be clear that we are dedicated to improving volumes. We have refined our plans and are prioritizing our investments to drive impactful results, and return to differentiated and sustainable volume-led growth, and you should expect improvement over the coming year and into 2025 and beyond. Now let's go to our fourth quarter performance in more detail. Turning to Slide 5. In our fourth quarter, sales increased 3%, including a 1% favorable impact from currency. In constant currency, sales grew 2%, reflecting a 5% contribution from pricing, which was partially offset by a 3% decline in volume and product mix. As expected, the benefit from the China recovery was fully offset by the impact of our strategic decisions to exit DSD -- Direct Store Delivery, of our bagged Hispanic spices in the Americas, and the exit of a private label product line and the divestiture of a small canning business, which was part of our Giotti Flavor Solutions operations in EMEA. Starting with where results differed from expectations. In Americas Consumer, we expected volume declines in the prepared food categories that we participate in, like frozen and Asian. But the decline was greater than we anticipated due to the more challenging macro trends and was broadly consistent with the performance of these categories. For mustard in the Americas, extremely low price points in private label impacted our consumption and is driving down category dollars. We plan to improve our volume trends in 2024 by narrowing price gaps, increasing promotions and, importantly, through distribution wins. Recipe mixes in the Americas showed increased stress from crossing key price points due to previous pricing actions. We have a plan to address these to return to volume growth. In our flavors product category, some of our consumer packaged food group customers experienced greater softness in volumes within their own business, more than we expected in both the Americas and EMEA. Finally, our growth of quick service restaurants and Flavor Solutions was impacted by slower than expected restaurant traffic in EMEA and Asia Pacific. Within Asia Pacific, some of our customers are experiencing boycotts in Southeast Asia related to geopolitical events. We are monitoring the situation and anticipate continued softness in these customer's volume to continue into 2024. Turning to what met our expectations in the quarter; we drove volume growth for a second quarter in a row in America spices and seasonings. In branded food service, our growth was strong across the portfolio driven by volume. In Asia Consumer, our recovery from COVID-related disruptions in China was in line with the expectations we had at the beginning of the quarter. Outside of China, for the quarter, our volume growth was strong across all categories. In EMEA Consumer, consistent with the third quarter, pricing actions contributed to double digit growth, which pressured volumes. Now I'd like to further build on some of the initiatives within our growth levers, notably increased brand marketing, targeted price gap management, new products and packaging renovation, which have already proven to strengthen our volume trends in key areas. We have intentionally chosen our investments in these areas as we believe they will generate the most significant returns. We are confident our investments will continue to drive improved results in 2024, and we expect to invest more, positioning us further for success in 2025 and going forward. First, America's spices and seasonings is a priority investment area for us, given our category leadership and its profitable growth potential for both McCormick and our customers. Our initiatives are driving U.S. branded sales volume growth, which strength during the fourth quarter in holiday performance. And looking at consumption, we continue to sequentially improve share trends again in the fourth quarter both in terms of dollars and units. We continue to activate initiatives of price gap management, innovation, packaging and a meaningful step-up in brand marketing support for America's spices and seasonings. And the results have begun to materialize, demonstrating that we have the right plans and are taking the right actions to grow in this attractive category. The renovation of our U.S. core everyday herb and spice portfolio, which began in the second quarter of 2023, continues to roll out according to plan. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had shifted about 75% of our renovated SKUs. And notably, products that have fully transitioned on shelf experienced stronger velocity. We are pleased with our results to date, which increased our confidence that this renovation will be a strong contribution to our growth in 2024 as our customers' shelves continue to transition. We are making progress on restoring distribution that was lost due to past supply issues. We have secured wins and new distribution. We expect to largely start seeing the impact of our actions in our results mid-2024, coinciding with most of our customers' shelf resets. Overall, we have a robust set of initiatives in flight and anticipate making progress throughout the year. I would expect growth in share gains in units and volume to lead our trends. Spending a moment on spices and seasonings and other key markets. Similar initiatives as in the U.S. are driving volume growth and share gains in Canada, France and Australia. We also renovated our spice and herb portfolio in Southeast Asia, with the same innovative packaging as the U.S. and EMEA, and began shipping the new products in the fourth quarter. We are supporting this transition with increased marketing spend in the first quarter. Next, in branded foodservice, we achieved strong volume growth across all customer segments. Our foodservice operators continue to expand their value menu options, and they are turning to our products to deliver great taste for a fraction of their costs. We drove share gains in spices and seasonings as well as our hot sauce share of tabletop, with expanded distribution, new products, customer wins and increased menu penetration, as well as our expertise in heat. Heat continues to be a growth accelerator globally for total McCormick, outpacing the rest of the portfolio as customers and consumers alike continue to drive demand in this flavor profile. New products contributed to fourth quarter growth. For instance, in the U.S., our Cholula salsas in the Mexican aisle are building distribution and bringing new consumers to the category. And our branded food service items, Frank's Mild Wings Sauce and Frank's Nashville Hot continue to perform at. In the U.K., Australia, we are driving hot sauce category growth with Cholula gaining momentum on shelf. In the U.S., we secured new hot sauce distribution during the quarter. And in the first quarter, we are launching new Frank's RedHot dips and popular flavors in a squeeze bottle format, as well as our national launch of Frank's Dill Pickle. We are well positioned going into our Super Bowl merchandising period. In summary, our investments in the key areas I just highlighted favorably impacted both our volume and margin performance for the quarter. Moving to gross margin. We are pleased with our performance, which continued to improve as the year progressed. Our results reflect effective price realization, the optimization of our cost structure and favorable product mix, driven by our portfolio optimization and focus in key areas. While confident in our ability to return to our historical margin profile in the near term, we will use improvements in our profitability to fuel continued investments in our business to drive our top line. We are in a strong position to benefit from the virtuous flywheel of margin expansion given the work that's been done throughout the business, and we are able to intentionally focus our investments on areas that we expect will have the greatest impact on improving volume performance and driving sustainable profit growth. Reflecting on our full year 2023 performance, I am proud of the progress we made in advancing our business in the right direction and our team is focused on returning to our long-term growth algorithm, strengthening our margins, significantly improving our cash flow, paying down our debt and reducing our leverage ratio. All have put McCormick in a position of strength to further invest with a focus on growth. Our foundation is strong. We have proven and powerful brands, and the results we are seeing from our refined and strengthened plans provide confidence in the effectiveness of our strategies and investments. Our initiatives will take time to materialize, and we expect volume trends to improve throughout the year and volume growth during the second half, notwithstanding any new macroeconomic headwinds. The pace of margin recovery to historical levels will take time as our focus is on investing to drive sustainable sales growth to generate quality earnings for years to come. I also want to highlight on share performance, that we are approaching our plans differently with an even greater competitive posture and more intentionality towards driving growth in our key categories. Now, let me highlight some ways in which we will drive growth through category management, brand marketing, new products, our proprietary technologies and our differentiated customer engagement. Starting in our Consumer segment with category management, where a key capability is revenue management, we have been building our discipline in revenue management for several years and have a history of optimizing pricing on shelf to benefit both McCormick and the retailer. As you would expect, this has become even more important in recent years. In the current environment, we are taking a surgical approach to managing our price gaps to private label and branded competitors, accelerating our efforts across various products and are seeing results. In our spices and seasonings category, we selected individual items we believe would be the most responsive based on the elasticities we were experiencing. For instance, in our iconic Black Pepper and Vanilla product lines, our actions proved to be effective. We are recapturing buyers, increasing household penetration and are driving profitable volume growth that is outpacing the category volume growth in these product lines. As I mentioned earlier, across key price points in Americas recipe mixes and are also leaning into our revenue management execution in this category. For example, in the fourth quarter, we focused on gravy as a key holiday item, which drove results, contributing to our successful holiday season. We expect to see further results from our actions as we work through the portfolio. Across all markets, our diverse portfolio allows us flexibility to optimize our pricing effectiveness. We look at both our everyday price and our promotional returns as well as use innovation, including price pack architecture to drive growth. These investments we make in price gap management result in greater volumes and improved margins over time. Importantly, customers that are adopting our recommendations are seeing better category performance, and McCormick is driving volume and share growth in their respective businesses. We are prioritizing brand marketing connecting with consumers and fueling growth with our increased investments. We have a history of investing behind our brands and did so again in 2023. We plan for a strong start to 2024, with aggressive first quarter brand marketing investments which are well underway. We expect a significant increase for the year, concentrated to the first half. We will continue to invest across various channels. We plan to further drive household penetration and increase buy rates with additional focus in retail media. Our first quarter plans include an increased Christmas holiday campaigns in all regions, increasing our value-focused messaging for our everyday spices and seasonings and recipe mix in the U.S. Also, supporting our packaging renovations that I mentioned earlier in both the U.S. and Southeast Asia, and promoting our new products in EMEA. Turning to new products, which are a key growth driver in both our Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments. In the Consumer segment, our 2023 launches are expected to substantially contribute to growth in 2024. For instance, in EMEA, we are thrilled with the early results from our range of Schwartz seasonings and recipe mixes that we launched with Nadiya Hussain, a British celebrity chef, as we entered the fourth quarter. We are expanding our household penetration, bringing in new and younger households into the brand. The recipe mixes in this range contributed along with other new products and expanded distribution to our fourth quarter growth in U.K. recipe mixes, which was double the category rate. In Flavor Solutions, collaborating with our customers on innovation continues to be a key driver of success. Across the portfolio, our customers continue to focus on innovation to meet consumers' needs. We are winning in flavors with better-for-you products and on-trend flavors; and, in branded foodservice, with our heat platform and value-oriented products for foodservice operators. We are pleased with our 2023 performance from new products, which contributed to our sales growth and accelerate compared to the prior year, as we expected. Importantly, we have a strong lineup of new products spanning heat, freshness, value, convenience and flavor exploration in our Consumer segment for 2024, which we will share more about at CAGNY in February. And in Flavor Solutions, we are also carrying a robust pipeline of new products into 2024, positioning McCormick and our customers for success. We are leveraging our proprietary technologies and Flavor Solutions to support our innovation to win share in attractive high-growth categories and to attract new customers. In addition, with our differentiated customer engagement approach, we are intentionally targeting a mid-market customer base who are category leaders in high-growth innovators as well as diversifying our customer base to drive share gains across our portfolio and profitable growth. Our actions are yielding results. For instance, in the fourth quarter, our volume growth in performance nutrition significantly outpaced the market. And in the beverage category, we drove sales growth even though the category decelerated, partially by targeting high-value and high-growth segments within beverage. With our flavor leadership and continued investments, we are fully committed to vigorously fuel category growth with our differentiated portfolio. We have confidence in our plans, which we'll build throughout the year and yield volume growth during the back half of the year. We are dedicating more resources to categories where we have the right to continue to win. We are seeing our actions drive momentum and solid results in areas where we have focused. We believe that the execution of our growth plans will be a win for consumers, our categories and McCormick, which will differentiate and strengthen our leadership. Now before I turn it over to Mike to provide more details on our fourth quarter financial performance and 2024 outlook, I would like to comment on recent changes in our Board of Directors. Freeman Hrabowski who has served as a Director for 27 years, will be retiring from the Board as of the end of March. I am grateful for his service and contributions, which has significantly benefited McCormick, and we will miss him. I also want to welcome Terry Thomas, who has joined our Board. Terry brings extensive global consumer product industry expertise through his current role as Chief Growth Officer for  Flowers Foods  (NYSE:FLO), and his experience at  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) prior to that. I look forward to working with Terry and the contributions he will make to McCormick.\nMike Smith: Thanks, Brendan, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 10. Our top line constant currency sales grew 2% compared to the fourth quarter of last year, reflecting 5% of pricing benefit, offset by a 3% volume mix decline. As Brendan mentioned, our volume performance was impacted by changes in consumers' behavior. In our Consumer segment, constant currency sales were flat, reflecting a 4% increase from pricing actions, offset by a 4% volume decline. The benefit from our recovery in China and the Hispanic product DSD exit to optimize margins netted to no overall impact for the total Consumer segment. On Slide 11, consumer sales in the Americas decreased 4% in constant currency with the DSD exit I just mentioned driving 2% of that decline. The remaining sales decline was due to lower volume and product mix in several areas of the portfolio, including, as Brendan mentioned, prepared foods, mustard and recipe mixes, which was partially offset by volume growth in spices and seasonings, which was driven by our investments. In EMEA, constant currency consumer sales increased 9%, with a 13% increase from pricing actions, partially offset by a 4% volume decline. Sales growth was broad-based across markets and categories. We remain at an elevated pricing environment in EMEA, and we expect volumes to improve as pricing wins in 2024. Constant currency consumer sales in the APAC region increased 31%, driven by a 26% volume increase, primarily due to the expected recovery in China. Outside of China, we also drove double-digit sales growth with strong volume and broad-based growth across all categories and markets. Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment on Slide 14. We grew fourth quarter constant currency sales 5%, reflecting a 7% increase from pricing, offset by a 2% decrease from volume and product mix. Our growth momentum in this segment was exceptional through the third quarter. And even with a deceleration in the fourth quarter, our sales growth for the year was strong. In the Americas, flavor solutions constant currency sales rose 6%, driven by pricing, as volume and product mix was comparable to the prior year. Sales growth was broad-based across the portfolio and led by branded foodservice. In EMEA, constant currency sales increased 2%, and with pricing actions contributing 14%, partially offset by a 3% impact from the divestiture of the Giotti canning business, a 9% decline in all other volume due to softness in some of our customers' volumes within their own businesses and a 1% impact from exiting a private label product line. In the APAC region, Flavor Solutions sales grew 5% in constant currency with a 6% contribution from pricing, offset by a 1% volume decline. Our business in China delivered strong growth. Outside of China, sales were negatively impacted by geopolitical boycotts in some of our quick service restaurant customers, as Brendan mentioned. As seen on Slide 18, gross profit margin expanded 320 basis points in the fourth quarter versus the year ago period. Drivers in the quarter included favorable product mix in both segments and our CCI and GOE programs, as well as effective price realization. Additionally, we lapped elevated costs related to some discrete issues and flavor solutions operations. Overall, we ended 2023 meeting the cost recovery plans we set as we entered the year. We are pleased with our gross margin expansion for the quarter and the year. Now moving to Slide 19. Selling, general and administrative expenses or SG&A, increased relative to the fourth quarter of last year as higher employee incentive compensation expenses were partially offset by CCI and GOE cost savings. Brand marketing also increased compared to the fourth quarter of last year, and we expect to invest further in 2024 to support our brands. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A increased 190 basis points. Sales growth and gross margin expansion, partially offset by higher SG&A costs, resulted in a constant currency increase in adjusted operating income of 11% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. In constant currency, adjusted operating income in the Consumer segment was flat. And in Flavor Solutions, adjusted operating income increased $0.73 in constant currency. We remain committed to restoring Flavor Solutions' profitability. And in the fourth quarter, as expected, we drove significant margin expansion versus prior year in this segment. For the total company, we expanded our adjusted operating margin by 130 basis points in the fourth quarter and 100 basis points for the year, which reflects our commitment to increase our profit realization and positions us well to make investments early in 2024 to fuel top-line growth. Turning to interest expense and income taxes on Slide 20. Our interest expense increased significantly over the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by the higher interest rate environment. And quickly touching on tax, our fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 22.3% compared to 23.1% in the year ago period. Both periods were favorably impacted by discrete tax items, with a more significant impact this year. Our income from unconsolidated operations in the fourth quarter reflects strong performance in our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico. We are the market leader with our McCormick branded mayonnaise, marmalade and mustard product lines in Mexico and the business contributed meaningfully to our net income and operating cash flow results. At the bottom-line, as shown on Slide 22, fourth quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share was $0.85 as compared to $0.73 for the year ago period. The increase was attributable to higher operating income driven by gross margin expansion and the results from our McCormick de Mexico joint venture I just mentioned. On Slide 23, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the year end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations was strong in 2023, $1.2 billion, nearly double our cash flow of $652 million in 2022. The increase was primarily driven by higher operating income and working capital improvements, including lower inventory. We returned $419 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $264 million for capital expenditures in 2023. Our capital expenditures include projects to increase capacity and capabilities to meet growing demand, advance our digital transformation and optimize our cost structure. Our priority remains to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. We remain committed to a strong investment-grade rating. We expect 2024 to be another year of strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives. We are well-positioned to continue paying down debt and coupled with ending 2023 and with a leverage ratio slightly above our 2024 year-end target of 3 times. We are pleased to be deleveraging faster than expected. Now turning to our 2024 financial outlook on Slide 24. Our 2024 outlook reflects our prioritized investments in key categories to strengthen volume trends and drive long-term sustainable growth, while appreciating the uncertainty of the consumer environment. We are well positioned with our cost savings programs to fuel investments for volume growth as well as generate operating margin expansion. The balancing of margin expansion and investments to drive growth is critical to our success, not only in 2024, but also into 2025 and beyond as we remain committed and confident in our long-term algorithm. Turning to the details. First, currency rates are expected to unfavorably impact sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share by approximately 1%. On the top line, we expect constant currency net sales to range between a decline of 1% to growth of 1%. We expect a favorable impact related to the wrap of last year's pricing actions, most significantly in the first half, partially offset by our price cap management investments that will drive volume growth. We expect several factors to impact our volume and product mix over the course of the year. First, we expect to drive improved volume trends as the year progresses through the strength of our brands and the intentional and targeted investments we are making. Our initiatives will take time to materialize, and we are expecting to return to volume growth during the second half of the year, notwithstanding any new macroeconomic headwinds. We have made strategic decisions to optimize our portfolio for profitable growth that will also impact volumes during the year. We decided to exit DSD of our bagged Hispanic spices in Americas consumer and to exit a private label product line in EMEA Flavor Solutions, both will impact the first quarter. And we divested the Giotti canning business, which will impact us through the third quarter. We expect to continue to prune lower-margin business through the year as we optimize our portfolio, the impact of which will be reflected within the natural fluctuation of sales. And finally, in China, our food away-from-home business, which is included in APAC Consumer, is expected to be impacted by slower demand in the first half of the year, and as such, we expect China Consumer sales to be comparable to 2023 for the full year. While we recognize there has been volatility in demand in China, we continue to believe in the long-term growth trajectory of our China business. Moving to gross margin. Our 2024 gross margin is projected to range between 50 to 100 basis points higher than 2023. This gross margin expansion reflects favorable impacts from pricing, product mix and the cost savings from our CCI and GOE programs, partially offset by the anticipated impact of a low single-digit increase in cost inflation and our increased investments. Additionally, we expect to begin reducing our dual running costs related to our transition to the new flavor solutions facility in the U.K. in the back half of the year. Moving to adjusted operating income. We expect 4% to 6% constant currency growth. This growth is projected to be driven by our gross margin expansion as well as SG&A cost savings from CCI and GOE programs, partially offset by our investments to drive volume growth, including brand marketing. We expect our brand marketing spend to increase high single digits in 2024, reflecting a double-digit increase in investments, partially offset by CCI savings. And we expect our increased investments in brand marketing to be concentrated in the first half of the year and weighted more to the first quarter. Overall, based on the flow-through of our volume expectations and the timing of our investments, we expect our profit to be less robust in the first half and anticipate strong profit growth in the second half of the year. Our 2023 adjusted effective income tax rate projection of approximately 22% is based upon our estimated mix of earnings by geography as well as factoring discrete items. We expect our rate to be higher in the first half of the year compared to the second half of the year. We expect a mid-teens increase in our income from unconsolidated operations, reflecting the strong performance we anticipate in McCormick De Mexico. To summarize, our 2024 adjusted earnings per share projection of $2.80 to $2.85 reflects a 4% to 6% increase compared to 2023, or 5% to 7% in constant currency. As Brendan noted, we are dedicated to improving volumes. We are prioritizing our investments to drive impactful results and return to differentiated sustainable volume-led growth. We remain confident in the underlying fundamentals of our business and delivering on the profitable growth reflected in our 2024 financial outlook.\nBrendan Foley: Thank you, Mike. Before moving to Q&A, I would like to provide some closing comments on Slide 25. Our business is moving in the right direction, we strengthened our margins, significantly improved our cash flow and are deleveraging ahead of expectations. From a top line perspective, volume trends improved sequentially through the third quarter, but fourth quarter performance was disappointing. Parts of our portfolio grew underscoring that our strategies and initiatives are working. In areas that were challenged, we know the drivers and are addressing those that we control. And combined with the initiatives we have in place, we fully expect we will drive improved trends and build to volume growth during the second half of 2024. We are committed to recovering our margins in both segments to historical levels, while making investments to drive sustainable top line growth. The fundamentals that have driven our historical performance remain in place. And we are as diligent as ever in driving value for our employees, consumers, customers and shareholders in 2024 and beyond. I am excited for the year ahead, which will be my first full year as CEO. I plan to drive an ambitious agenda with greater competitive posture and more intentionality that capitalize on our strong business fundamentals as well as the value of our brands and capabilities and have driven our past success. McCormick is a growth company, a global leader in flavor, with a long-term orientation and a strong culture. I am committed to advance our leadership and our differentiation. Our strategic pillars: growth, performance and people, remain consistent. I am energized to further incorporate my mark on our growth plans. In a fast-changing global environment, we need to build on our competitive strengths and opportunities to remain a differentiated market leader. As such, I would like to share the five priorities that the entire McCormick organization is rallying behind, as we enter 2024. First, strengthen our global leadership in core categories. That means, growing volume and market share in herbs, spices and seasonings and condiments, strengthening our leadership in heat and increasing the global scale of our flavors business and expanding our branded foodservice business. Second, drive profitable growth and higher returns on investments. We want to restore the operating margin we have lost the last several years. But importantly, do so in a measured way, using our cost savings and operating leverage to fuel top line growth in the near-term that will drive sustainable profits for years to come. Third, accelerate our digital transformation to enhance how we serve consumers and customers to work faster and more efficiently, and to strengthen decision-making by further leveraging data and insights. Fourth, continue to elevate our power of people culture and build the next generation of leaders and capabilities that will drive McCormick's success well into future years. And finally, all these contribute to our fifth priority, which is to strengthen and expand stem competitive advantages to make McCormick even more effective in the marketplace. Our advantages are critical to ensuring we deliver on our growth potential. Simply put, I am committed to harnessing the collective expertise of our talented McCormick team with a renewed sense of urgency and speed to deliver on these priorities, resulting in long-term sustainable profitable growth that will be industry-leading. While 2024 is an important year of investments, we are confident in our capabilities and enthusiastic about some early signposts of success. And we are committed to returning to the type of growth that investors expect from McCormick. The foundation has been laid and building blocks are in place, and I look forward to sharing more about them at CAGNY in February. As I said, I am excited for the year ahead and delivering on our long-term objectives. Finally, before turning to your questions, I want to recognize McCormick employees around the world for their contributions in 2023, and the momentum they are carrying into 2024, and reiterate my confidence that, together, we will drive the profitable growth reflected in our 2024 outlook. Now for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. Thanks so much. Good morning everybody.\nBrendan Foley: Good morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. Maybe to start off, given where you ended 2023 and coupled with your commentary on investing in the business, I guess, can you tell us a bit about how you're thinking about volume as you progress through 2024, and I guess how you would be positioned going into 2025?\nBrendan Foley: Well, Andrew, thanks for the question. Let me start by commenting on how we ended 2023 from a volume perspective. While the fourth quarter was below our expectations, there were bright spots, because our actions are working in a number of categories that are critical for us. And for the challenging area, you know what the issues are, and I'm pleased with the speed and urgency with which the team is addressing them. I guess just to step back, pre-pandemic, we consistently drove volume growth across our business in both segments. And the macro dynamics of the last several years disrupted this. And so we see 2024 as an important moment to get back there as soon as we can. We do have a bias towards even greater investment on the business. And as I've said, we're approaching our plans differently with even greater competitive posture, greater intentionality towards driving volume growth and share in those key and really attractive categories. I think where we stand at this point in 2024 is we appear to be moving beyond those macro dynamics. Yet at the same time, we recognize the uncertainty of the environment, and therefore, I'm taking a cautious view on that outlook. From a consumption standpoint, we do expect to exit 2024 in a stronger position than how we exited in 2023. And importantly, though, we're also entering 2024 in a position of strength in terms of our ability to invest in the business and expand margins. So we're able to intentionally focus those investments on areas that we expect will have the greatest impact on improving volume performance and driving sustainable profit growth. We expect our volumes to improve as we progress through the year and to drive the volume growth during the second half. This momentum is expected to continue into 2025, notwithstanding any new surprises on sort of the macroeconomic headwinds that might be out there. And I believe our investments will drive quality earnings growth and will put us on a trajectory of -- on that long-term algorithm. So those are the -- that's the way we're thinking about exiting '23, how we're thinking about '24 and as we go into '25.\nAndrew Lazar: Thanks. And then I guess a good segue to that is, how is that you're able to make investments to drive the top line and yet still improve margins. I was hoping you could help us a bit with that perspective. Thank you.\nBrendan Foley: Well, as I said, we're entering '24 in a position of strength after navigating these dynamics over the last several years. And I'll turn it over to Mike just to give some context, and I'll wrap it up with a few other thoughts.\nMike Smith: Yes. Good morning, Andrew. Yes, as you saw from our results, we ended the year with strong operating margin performance, and for the full year, up 100 basis points. A big key to our recovery was recovering the cost increases through pricing. Obviously, 20% cost increases two years ago, over 10% last year, there was a big job to do that. So we're able to do that in 2023, which helped our margins. Our CCI and GOE programs, we've talked about a lot, really performed and give a strong momentum, frankly, into 2024. 2024, as you think about this year, we're showing some margin improvement about 80 basis points. And with low single-digit inflation, and you think about four or five years ago when we had low single-digit inflation, CCI really works for us. You take a little bit of pricing and we're having some pricing wrap in 2024 and then you can decide what to do with. And CCI, some of it drops to the bottom line through margin improvement, we're making those increased revenue price cap investments, which we've always done some degree of that, but also our brand A&P up -- double digits is another way we're using CCI this year. So it's kind of a sweet spot for us at low single-digit inflation environment as we think about it. And the portfolio optimization we've talked about last year, which -- a bit of that continues into this year. So, again, helping drive our margins up. We want to recover over time the gross profit margins we had pre-pandemic, but we're doing it judiciously.\nAndrew Lazar: Thanks so much.\nBrendan Foley: Mike said on sort of this portfolio optimization, we really do see that working. So we did make a couple of intentional moves as you know. That's really, I think, allowing us to invest even more in the part of the portfolio, which we know will be the strongest. And then we did make a lot of targeted investments in '23. So that's yielding results. We like where that's going. And it's achieving high ROI, and that's carrying us into '24. So I do believe this intentional investment in those categories that are core to us will really be the biggest drivers of profitable growth. And we should see that margin accretion from that mix of sales. So we really do believe we're operating in a position of strength there.\nAndrew Lazar: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.\nKen Goldman: Hi. Good morning everybody.\nBrendan Foley: Good morning.\nKen Goldman: Hi. I wanted to ask about Consumer Americas. In particular, you spoke today about managing price gaps, maybe a bit more tightly ahead. We started to hear from some other food producers that in the U.S., maybe some promotional lifts aren't working quite as well as expected. I guess I was just curious if this is a dynamic you've experienced as well. And I really am trying to get a sense just how much more investment is needed to narrow the price gaps you mentioned. And if in general, really consumer behavior in the U.S. is, in some way, more difficult to navigate than what it's been in past challenging times or kind of pretty much what you expect to see as consumers tighten their wallets a little bit.\nMike Smith: Okay. Let me kick off and -- a couple of questions in there. The first, I think, had to do with just promotional lifts and what we're seeing. And I'm not necessarily trying to compare to the comments of other companies. But what we're seeing right now in our business today is we're not seeing huge declines or sort of reduced significant lifts of promotion. But there's an important consideration there, which is we're really a heavy base business. We don't have a ton of, if you think about our percentage of consumption. We're in the 90% range in terms of base consumption and the rest is really coming through promotions. So we're not overly reliant there. And I would just say that it's probably an area that I don't know that it's fair to draw a correlation between our performance and others. Now price gap management, in terms of how we're approaching that, we're looking across our portfolio. And just in the case of like spices and seasonings, it's a really broad portfolio with many subcategories underneath there. And each and every item -- you take compare black pepper to Montreal Steak they all have different price elasticities and where the consumer is to go. And so we have been surgically looking at this at a SKU level to make sure that we're doing the right thing to really drive overall growth in volume and unit consumption. And so that's allowed us to really, I think, be very, very sharp about how we drive this investment in a targeted way to make sure that we're starting to drive volume growth. In 2023, we saw a lot of improvement in parts of our business where we started to apply this. And I think like I said on the call, a good example was Black Pepper or Vanilla, and we started to really see the -- not only the volume of the unit share gain. And so that gave us really, I think, a lot of kind of stair-step into those investments. And that's the way we're going to do it in 2024 too. We're expanding that investment. We're going to continue to look at the line, we assess it. Honestly, every month and taking a look at where we see the individual products perform across the shelf. And then we decide what we need to do from a revenue and category standpoint. But I wanted to put on top of that, we're applying more A&P to the business, too, at the same time. And I think that's really important. We are seeing really good performance from A&P and it encourages us to continue to spend more on the business. And so you'll see more of that from us, I think, going forward. I'm not sure if I captured all your questions there, but let me know if I did.\nBrendan Foley: I think to maybe one point. As we get the price differentials right, the advertising is even more effective. And that's important. And we're happy with the ROIs on our A&P, but it gets even better when you have the right price differential, as we've seen with Black Pepper, Vanilla and other categories.\nKen Goldman: No that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And just a very quick follow-up, I wasn't quite sure I picked up on what you think the most important tactics may need to be to get momentum rolling in your China Consumer business to the extent you want. And maybe how quickly some of those actions can start to take effect.\nBrendan Foley: On China, and just a little bit of context here, our food away from home business, which is included in Asia Pacific Consumer, it definitely will \u2013 we expect to see slower demand, especially sort of in the first half of the year. But we do expect overall China sales in 2024 to be comparable to 2023. But maybe for some more additional context, Mike and I spent a week in China in early January, just actually a few weeks ago just visiting our teams there and assessing dense conditions. And I would say, broadly, our outlook for the Chinese consumer does remain cautious. There's a number of indicators that kind of point to this. There's high unemployment with young adults, low consumer confidence. We see consumers with a reluctance to spend. And uniquely in our business, we tend to serve the smaller independent restaurants, particularly in Central China, and we see them losing traffic to larger chains and QSRs, because they're really driving either really strong value or they're winning on just even more store growth overall. And so we see this playing out in the retail category there, especially with the modern trade. Just to share a quick anecdote, as we were there, I took one afternoon just to walk around and actually I forgot the pack a tie, So I had to go buy a tie and go to an apartment store. What struck me was really a lot of movement in people outside than on the streets. And I want to go get a cup of coffee. It's kind of empty. Go to the department store, not spoke with anybody almost. And so there's just not really a lot of active spending. We see a lot of people out and about the mobilities there, and it's returned, but we're not seeing the spending. And I think it's broadly sort of an example of what we are observing as we were in the market there. Having said that though, like we do in other regions, we do have plans to really address the change in trends with the Chinese consumer. And we do expect our Flavor Solutions business to be a bit stronger this year just due to the QSR trends. But we do expect a gradual recovery in China, starting probably more in the second half of 2024. And the exact pace of growth will really be determined by how that macroeconomic parameter kind of plays out and consumer confidence plans over the next few quarters. But we really do continue to believe in the long-term growth trajectory of this market and are working to strengthen those plans as we go through 2024.\nKen Goldman: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nAlexia Howard: Good morning everyone.\nBrendan Foley: Good morning.\nMike Smith: Good morning.\nAlexia Howard: Okay. So your sales algorithm for 2024 is obviously below where it would normally be at minus 1% to plus 1%. Can you quantify how much of a headwind are these deliberate decisions to exit the DSD business, to divest canning, to exit low-margin business in Europe? We just want to get a sense for how much is you choosing to exit versus what the underlying numbers are?\nMike Smith: Hi, Alexia, yes, it's around 1% for Q1, but then it really Peters out the rest of the year. So very small the rest of the year. But 1% for Q1 as we lapped the decisions we made last year.\nAlexia Howard: Got it. Okay. And then the market share trends in U.S. measured channels are obviously what everybody seems to have their eye on right now. Do you have a view, given your price gap management and the marketing spending investments, the innovation pickup, when we might start to see that improve sequentially and when we might even start to see that turn positive again? Just wondering how long it's going to take to start to see those benefits in the share line.\nBrendan Foley: Well, Alexia, thanks for the question. We never really project exactly what to expect and share, because there's just a lot of dynamics that might happen at the shelf. But I would point to how we're talking about volume and our outlook on volume as we think about the first half, the second half and as we expect to kind of grow volume in the back half of the year. That certainly will have an influence on what we see play out in share performance. But we tend not to sort of specifically tell you. I don't think that there is a specific quarter I can tell you when that's going to happen.\nAlexia Howard: Okay. Thank you. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Max Gumport with BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY). Please proceed with your question.\nMax Gumport: Hi, thanks for the question. With regard to cadence on the top line, it sounds like you've got volume trends that could improve as you go through the year with even growth in the second half. But then you've got the impact of last year's pricing actions which will wane as we go through the year. Would you expect those two factors to roughly offset each other, such that organic net sales growth is relatively consistent through the year? Or is there any net sales cadence we should be keeping in mind? Thanks.\nMike Smith: I mean the pricing, Max, is really focused on the first half a bit more in the first quarter based on the timing of our pricing. I mean, the volume growth is sequential across both segments. And as you know, based on our fourth quarter performance, Flavor Solutions is exiting the year a little better trajectory than -- or at least based than Consumer. So as you model those things, you think about sequential improvement to get to that zero to negative two volume growth kind of the first half, second half story. And then pricing is really heavily weighted to the first half, primarily the first quarter.\nMax Gumport: Thanks. And then as a follow-up, you've characterized your outlook as embedding a more cautious view regarding 2024, a few times now. It sounds like much of that conservatism is around your underlying assumptions on volume. You talked about the value-seeking behavior in the U.S. and flat sales growth in China. But I was hoping you could dive a bit deeper into some of those more cautious use you're taking and also they're impacting your gross margin commentary as well? Thank you.\nBrendan Foley: Well, good morning, Max, I'll maybe kick it off with some context around your question on sales and consumption and sort of the state of the consumer, and I'll pass it over to Mike for commentary on -- I think you had a question there with regard to margin. But I think we are taking a cautious view with regard to where the consumer is right now. And that's really informed by what we saw in Q4. We just saw a little bit more shifting, particularly as you think about how the quarter played out and if you think about consumption trends, we saw consumers really pulled back in September and October, and then really wait until right before the holidays to really make a lot of their purchases. And we even see -- saw similar indications leading up to Christmas. So, what's underneath that, I think, is people were certainly holding off there, making a lot more trips to the store, buying a lot fewer items and units. And maybe even smaller units actually started to come true, I think, from a consumer trend standpoint. And I think we just have to acknowledge that this is a little bit different than what we saw in the summer. It was a little bit more pronounced. Certainly, it affected our trends as we kind of been really clear about. And so it's prudent for us to just take a cautious view where the consumer is going to be going here in early 2024. And so we felt like it was best to recognize that in our outlook, particularly as we think about the first half of the year. But we're also going to be putting in more investment in the business, more A&P. So we expect also to be able to meet the consumer where they are right now and really try to focus on our game plan, which is to drive volume growth. Mike, do you want to add...\nBrendan Foley: Yes. Would you mind repeating the margin question, I didn't quite get that.\nMax Gumport: I was wondering if the conservatism that you discussed that really is just focused on the commentary you just discussed on volumes or if it applies to gross margins as well, that there's some -- more cautious outlook embedded in the gross margin guidance as well?\nBrendan Foley: Yes. I mean we're confident in our CCI and GOE programs. I mean we've baked -- low single-digit inflation environment, like I said before, which we have good line of sight generally for the rest of the year, gives us more confidence there. First quarter is going to be our highest cost increase. And we see it petering down after that and our pricing is going to be the highest in the first quarter, too. Generally, I think what I'd say, if you think about last year with our GOE programs, we met our targets. Actually, we exceeded a bit our external targets. We were a bit prudent because -- but we met our internal target. So I would say being prudent is the word of the day. And love to over-deliver if we could. But we also realized in this environment, making investments on price gap management and A&P is really important. So we'll assess that as the year goes on.\nMax Gumport: Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Powers: Hi. Thanks very much.\nBrendan Foley: Good morning Steve.\nSteve Powers: So -- good morning. So it sounds like at the enterprise level, pretty minimal pricing in the back half. I think that implies, as I listened to the commentary and kind of do the math and think about the price gap management, I think that implies negative pricing in the Consumer business at least in the U.S. in the back half. I wonder if you can talk about that, how deep those kind of above-the-line investments may need to be or how you're thinking about that. And whether there's a risk that at the enterprise level pricing actually, this negative, as we flow through the year in pursuit of this volume recovery.\nMike Smith: Yes, Steve, it's Mike. I'll take that. And if Brendan has any comments, he'll layer then in. I mean we talk about pricing for the full year being around 1%, and that includes our price gap management, too. So don't miss that point. And as you think about the first quarter, as I said before, that's the majority of the lapping of last year's pricing. First quarter, first half, that's where a lot of the price activities come through, so less so in the second six. So I'd say that for the full year, we're comfortable with pricing at one, I don't know what math you're looking at to make it negative, but I don't see that, honestly, for the full year. And from a -- and really by segment, too, you've got to think about it too. I mean Flavor Solutions is going to be a bit higher than 1%. Consumer is going to be a little bit lower from a pricing perspective. So we're managing it very closely. And we're comfortable with the full year guidance.\nSteve Powers: Okay. Okay. Fair enough. I guess in Flavor Solutions, can you help just maybe a little bit more perspective on what you're assuming both in terms of Flavor's customer volume trends and restaurant traffic, both in the U.S. and overseas, where you've seen some softness to late? Just want to a little perspective there on that segment.\nBrendan Foley: Sure, Steve. Our growth momentum in Flavor Solutions was pretty exceptional, I think, throughout the year in 2023 with double-digit growth in the first three quarters and slight volume growth there. But even with the deceleration in the fourth quarter, we had pretty strong organic growth throughout 2023. And we do expect to continue to make really good progress there. Although, we\u2019re not going to be in double digits, I think, in 2024, but still making really good progress. To give you maybe more of a regional consideration, as I think through the portfolio. In the Americas, we continue to drive strong branded foodservice volume. And in flavors, particularly in a number of the categories that we tend to have some strong performance and like performance nutrition and beverage, we see continued strong performance in volume. And I think that we would expect that to continue into 2024. Across the rest of the flavor product category, a lot of our growth was impacted by the softness of our customers' performance in the market with regard to units and volume. And we saw a little bit more drop than we would have expected, not inconsistent with our own consumer business. And so while we're disappointed in that softness, we still believe our results are pretty good in this area. I think that's the chance of that continuing to 2024, probably likely. In EMEA, as we mentioned in our third quarter call, that our customers there are, both for packaged goods and also quick serve restaurants, are experiencing softness in their volumes within their business, too. And we anticipated that in the fourth quarter. However, there's even maybe a little bit more than what we expected. So almost like a similar theme to what I said about the U.S. And so we expect some softness related there as we enter in Q1. But we're optimistic, again, that we'll continue to sort of improve every quarter as we go through 2024. And then in Asia Pacific, our growth that was impacted by slower than expected restaurant traffic. Some of that really had to do with just unrelated matters, but some boycotts issues that we're seeing in Southeast Asia. But we saw some nice performance in China, so I would expect that to continue in 2024 and some trends. So that's just some context around Flavor Solutions.\nSteve Powers: Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. I\u2019ll pass it on. Thank you.\nBrendan Foley: Okay.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Samuelson: Yes. Thank you. Good morning everyone.\nBrendan Foley: Good morning.\nAdam Samuelson: Good morning. I wanted to come back to the consumer segment and maybe at a higher level. As we think about where the business and the specific categories are today versus where they were pre-COVID. Obviously, there's enough number of consumption and occasion changes in terms -- and distribution changes with inflation through the pandemic. But where are we today in your business and your key categories, as you think about price elasticity, as you think about price gaps and where there actually has been a lasting consumption change versus consumer behavior pre-pandemic.\nBrendan Foley: Well, with so much has changed since 2019, I think that -- if I think about the entirety of all the different levers and variables that you were talking about, whether it's price elasticity or volume and where the consumer is, there's been reasonably enough significant change that. As we take a look at our categories, we're taking a look at in terms of how they're performing today and where we need to go in order to drive volume growth. And as we said earlier, that's a component of increased A&P. A lot of that advertising focused on talking about value. Parts of our portfolio, we know that price gap management can have a really effective impact on turning around unit volume trends. And so I think that's an indication of where the consumer is right now. If you look at unit volume performance, either in our business or probably the category, pricing has had an impact, and we have to acknowledge that. Having said that, though, if I compare our business organically, and product mix, compared to 2019, our total organic volume is about the same as 2019. We haven't really lost significant volume or on product mix since pre-pandemic. And so I think that's one sort of consideration to have is, while there's been a lot of change in many ups and downs, I think, if you think about all these macro dynamic impacts we've been going through, we find ourselves in a similar volume position as we were in 2019. I don't -- I think I might have provided the context that you're looking for.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay. No, that's helpful. And then, as we think about Flavor Solutions moving forward, just how do you think about -- you see the competitive position of the portfolio today, what you're seeing from your customers, the categories you're in and the competitive set, do you feel like you have the breadth of portfolio? Do you think that the categories that are growing with your customers or you're properly positioned to participate there? Or do you think that, as you look at kind of the -- your peers, that there's room to narrow the growth gap?\nBrendan Foley: Well, as I think about our competitive posture in Flavor Solutions, I feel really good about it. It starts with having great capabilities in technology and a great team. And I think we do have a differentiated approach towards driving growth, particularly in flavors and seasonings in that part of our business. From a technology standpoint, we continue to win and sort of there's -- a lot of categories that we operate in there that we're targeting because they're positive and high growth. And we also tend to get a good mix of large customers and moderately in small-sized customers who tend to be characterized by much even higher growth. As we think about that as a portfolio mix of customers, we're seeing a lot of strength coming from that. And I would just point to our Boeing (NYSE:BA) trends throughout '23. And as we think about '24 to be an indication of how we think we're performing relative to the market there overall. And so those are some indications. Now, the other one on top of that would be heat. And we continue to see growth through heat. We continue to see that as a as the part of that portfolio, if you will, it tends to grow at an even higher rate just due to where consumers are. And we talked a lot about heat extensively in terms of how popular it is. And so that's another reason to believe that we feel like we're competitively poised in this part of our business. It's an exciting part of our business. It's an exciting part of our business. It's one that's receiving a lot of increased investment, too, as we think about building capacity, technology and really growing to global scale.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay. I appreciate the color all. I will pass it on. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Smith with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions.\nMatt Smith: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to dive in a little bit on the guidance. If we look at it from a high level, it includes roughly 80 basis points or so of operating margin expansion. Can you talk about the expansions for each business as we look at fiscal 2024? Is Flavor Solutions expected to have an outsized contribution again as margin continues to recover there? And can the margin expand in the Consumer business, even as you step up investments to manage price gaps and absolute price points?\nMike Smith: Hi Matt, its Mike. I mean they're not materially different between segments to be honest. So the 50 to 100 basis points at the gross margin line and approximately 80 at the OP margin line. To your point, there are some price gap management items within the Consumer business, but there's also portfolio optimization, the GOE and CCI numbers which hit both segments. So I would say not materially different.\nMatt Smith: Thank you for that. And a follow-up on the price gaps and absolute price points that you're talking about managing. One thing we're seeing in the U.S. measured channel data is that the share losses McCormick is seeing in spices and seasonings, only about 1/4 of that is going to private label. Can you talk about the branded environment? Are you seeing a pickup in competitive pressure there? Or is this really a product of price gaps that you believe you can manage to?\nBrendan Foley: Largely, I think it's a product of price gaps that we can manage to. But I think your observations would align with ours in that it isn't strictly an issue regarding private label or other branded competition. I think it's really an attractive category that has always received new competitors and new entrants. And so we look broadly when we think about competition in that part of our portfolio, as being -- and at the shelf is both watching those gaps versus private label and also branded competitors.\nMatt Smith: Thank you. I will pass it on.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Moskow: Hi. Just a couple of follow-up questions hi there Brendan and Mike.\nBrendan Foley: Good morning Rob. Hello.\nRobert Moskow: Yes. In the past, you used to give a global flavor category growth rate, and I remember it being around 4% to 6%. Do you still keep track of that globally? And do you know where it is right now? And just -- and then I have a follow-up.\nBrendan Foley: We do. I mean we look at that annually. And it's part of our strategic planning process. And so yes, we do spend time making sure we understand how that's performing. But I think your 5% to 7%, I think, is -- or actually you said 4% to 6%, but I would tell you it's generally around those same numbers. We tend to think about it is 5% to 7% at a global level.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. So the global demand for flavor really hasn't changed. It's just that -- but your top line guide is around zero. So is the message here today that nothing's really changed in the consumer demand for flavor? Because it sounds like you're also saying there's a lot of trading down going on or cautious consumer spending, so I thought that would mean that the category is a little bit weaker, too.\nBrendan Foley: No, I would urge you not to take away that as an indication that the category is weaker. This is still a very attractive category. Also appreciate that the category at the global level has also gone through a lot of inflation in pricing and similar factors, but we still see this as a very attractive category for the total company. And so that is not the view that we take, particularly with the data that we look at. And so I think maybe that got at the heart of your question.\nRobert Moskow: Yes, certainly. And then the follow-up is, you said that you shipped 75% of your new packaging to retailers so far. But do you have any way of quantifying what percent of the ACV has implemented your resets? I thought some of it would happen in 2023. It sounds like a lot will happen in mid-2024. But are you quantifying that way?\nBrendan Foley: It's harder to quantify because it's \u2013 we know how much we're shipping out in terms of our total portfolio that's getting this new package. And so as I said, that number is at 75%. And that, we feel that's \u2013 we're pretty accurate about that. But now the reflection on shelf, as all this inventory is flowing in on shelf, that's happening on a lag to that 75% number. We expect it to just continue to increase through the first half of the year. I think through the first half of the year, we should largely be caught up to that number to specific standpoint, too. If you walk into a store today, you're going to see on the shelf some in the old package, some of the new package, and that's just maybe an indication of how you might think about flow-through overall. However, I will tell you that as we do look at specific accounts and locations where we know we're seeing a lot of that flow through already have occurred, we are seeing a nice pickup in velocity as we would have expected to be the case, because we've seen this package perform in EMEA in a similar way. And it really does deliver on the SKUs for freshness for consumers and really kind of takes it up a notch in terms of the overall benefit and offering that we're providing consumers. So we feel pretty good about that. What you'll also hear us talk about is we're going to start to move other parts of the product line into this package, too, beginning in the back half of 2024. So we're not done. But this part of our line that we've been speaking about since mid-last year is still in the process of flowing through on shelf.\nMike Smith: That gives us belief in the sequential building of volume during 2024 into the second half, as you alluded to.\nRobert Moskow: Right. I'm sorry, one last question. I appreciate the plan to increase brand building this year. Can you tell us how much it increased in 2023 when it was all said and done?\nBrendan Foley: I think we were, Rob, if I'm not mistaken\u2026\nMike Smith: 3% to 4% range, yes.\nBrendan Foley: 3% to 4% range for 2023. Know that underneath that, we tend to see working media grow a lot faster than that, because we're also offsetting it with other productivity and taking out more nonworking investments. But 2023 is in that range. Now 2024 though, is in the double-digit range. And we feel really good about that where we're putting that investment.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question this morning comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nRob Dickerson: Great. Thanks so much. Maybe if we could just touch quickly on kind of Q1, because I think kind of throughout the call, I've heard you say maybe slightly higher cost relative to the full year in Q1 and then also feel like A&C is a little front half loaded. And then I think maybe volumes, given -- hopefully, they improved of the year, would imply that there be a little bit more pressure in Q1, especially given the divestment. So, just curious if there are certain moving pieces to Q1 that you would clearly like us to consider. So that's the first question.\nMike Smith: Yes, that's great. Let me take that one, Rob, and maybe summarize it all for you. And as you've pointed out, the sequential improvement in volume we see from the fourth quarter, also considered, Consumer starting at a slightly lower place in flavor solutions. So as you model that, build that into your model and build throughout the year. Pricing actions are primarily first -- the lapping of that primarily first half related. Maybe concentrated, I'd say, in the first quarter. However, cost in the first quarter, we're still seeing high single-digit inflation. It does go down to averaging of low single-digit inflation for the year, but there is a spike -- not a spike, but the highest level will be in the first quarter at high single-digit inflation. We get a bit of favorable product mix in the first quarter due to some of the initiatives we're talking about. But we're also seeing some of the negatives from an investment in price gap initiatives in Q1 primarily. So, as we think about pricing, a bit of that will be offset within the price gap management activities. GOE had a little bit of favorability to the wrap from last year in the first half, a bit in the first quarter too. And then as you mentioned, brand marketing up double digits in the first quarter is something that we're really driving toward. And not to forget tax, sometimes we do with tax. It's 22% for the year, but we see a higher tax rate in the first quarter and getting better as the year goes on. And don't forget, unfavorable FX throughout the whole year of about 1%.\nRob Dickerson: Okay. Perfect. That's very helpful. And then quickly, just on Flavor Solutions. Clearly, if we look back a few years ago, we speak to the margin recovery now kind of coming out of the post-pandemic cost inflation environment, really kind of the main driver of kind of your somewhat depressed margin now relative to history, still from Flavor Solutions, maybe a little less so. I mean, clearly, you're not optimize or maximize on consumer, but there is a little bit more pressure on Flavor Solutions. So, I'm just curious, I remember going back 15 years or so, right, and there was a strategy to increase that margin in Flavor Solutions that didn't happen, but then it actually really did happen. And now it's just not happening again. So I'm kind of curious, as you think longer term, right, kind of margin profile of McCormick, kind of given the initiatives you've been discussing even today, on improving that side of the business, what kind of does get you back there, right? I mean it's just volume and mix? Or it just seems like that recovery has maybe been a little bit slower? That's all.\nMike Smith: Hi Rob, it's Mike. I'll start and Brendan can add. You're right. We've been on a journey with Flavor Solutions. I can remember, it wasn't 15 years ago, but we were at a 6% OP margin. And we really, through focused cost initiatives, portfolio management, we're able to get that to over 14% pre-COVID, pre-pandemic. And we had aspirations for higher because our peers in the flavor industry are higher than that. And we still do aspire to those higher numbers. Obviously, COVID, the pricing costing relationship, that took over 300 basis points as we priced to cost. We did margin up that took -- that's over a 300 basis point impact on our margins there. So we've said we're going to build that back overtime through initiatives like CCI and things like that. We've had early success. I mean with the pricing initiatives we had last year in 2023, we took our operating margin from 8% in 2022 to 10% and 2023, granted still below where we were, but we see positive movement this year as we think about our total margin. I said both segments will see positive operating margin improvement. And we're in the process -- for Flavor Solutions, it's a pretty large number. As we are transitioning our large U.K. manufacturing facility, 2024 and 2025, you'll see some favorable tailwinds there which will help Flavor Solutions' margin. But to your point, and Brendan talked about, the focus on those great growing categories in the flavor side of the business, those are generally higher margin, they're stickier. That is our strategy that will help us drive our margins going forward.\nBrendan Foley: The only thing I'll add on top of what Mike just said with regard to just that constant focus against improving margin. We're also -- as we continue to shift customers to higher-margin product lines, more insulated technology, et cetera, it allows us to continue to grow margin too. But I think Mike pretty much nailed it there. And that's our outlook on it. It's still pretty positive. And it's just going to take us a little bit longer, as we've been calling out really ever since, I think, last year.\nRob Dickerson: Super. Great. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Ms. Freiha, for any final comments.\nFaten Freiha: Thank you all for joining today's call. If you have any further questions regarding today's information, please feel free to contact me. And this concludes this morning's conference call. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you.

Today's call is being recorded. Fourth Quarter 2023 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company's website at Marshmclennan.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the Marsh McLennan website. During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today's earnings release. [Operator Instructions]. I'll now turn this over to John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan.\nJohn Doyle: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter results reported earlier today. I'm John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO, and the CEOs of our businesses, Martin South of Marsh, Dean Klisura of Guy Carpenter, Martine Ferland of Mercer, and Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah DeWitt, head of Investor Relations. 2023 was an outstanding year for Marsh McLennan. Total revenue grew 10% to $22.7 billion. We generated 9% underlying revenue growth, continuing our best period of growth in more than two decades, with each of our businesses delivering strong results. Adjusted operating income grew 17% to $5.6 billion. This on top of 11% growth in 2022. Our adjusted operating margin increased 130 basis points, marking the 16th consecutive year we've reported margin expansion, and adjusted EPS grew 17%. We invested $1.6 billion in acquisitions that added to our talent, capabilities, and scale. This was our largest year for acquisitions in nearly two decades, aside from 2019 when we acquired JLT. Our acquisition of Graham expanded MMA\u2019s mid-Atlantic presence, Honan\u2019s strength in our Australian middle market business, and our transaction with Westpac created one of Australia's most competitive super funds. At the same time, we continued to optimize our portfolio, with the sale of two administration businesses at Mercer, which closed on January 1, 2024, and we delivered significant capital return to shareholders, raising our dividend by 20%, and completing $1.15 billion of share repurchases. I'm proud of what our team achieved in 2023. Our colleagues executed on key initiatives and generated value for clients and shareholders. Our performance reflects execution of a well-defined strategy, which includes building a culture that attracts and retains top talent, strengthening our capabilities through organic and inorganic investment, positioning ourselves in segments and geographies with attractive growth and margin profiles, leveraging data insights and innovation to support clients in managing uncertainty and finding new opportunities, and delivering the power of Marsh McLennan\u2019s perspective to help clients thrive. I just returned from the World Economic Forum where geopolitical, economic, climate, technology, and social risks were all very much top of mind for business and government leaders. Marsh McLennan is uniquely positioned to help clients manage the broad range of outcomes they're confronting from these issues. The launch of the Unity facility with Ukraine in November is a great example. Marsh, Oliver Wyman, and Guy Carpenter, came together to create an innovative insurance solution through a public-private partnership. Unity is now providing access to affordable war risk insurance for grain shipments in the Black Sea. The Ukrainian government's ambition is for the facility to enable nearly 1,000 shipments annually, helping to support their economy and global food security. Launching this facility was a proud moment for us, and I can't think of a better example of our purpose, our capabilities, and our impact in action. In so many ways, Marsh McLennan is well positioned to address today's challenges, and we are only just beginning to harness our combined capabilities, which are a distinct advantage. We are inspired by the possibilities, and consider it a privilege to do this important work. Our business strategy is complemented by a balanced approach to expense and capital management. We focus on generating consistent, strong earnings growth, and have a discipline of growing revenue faster than expenses. Our approach to capital allocation delivers results today, while investing to sustain growth in the future. And we are implementing new ways to operate, reduce complexity, and organize for impact. The strong value propositions of our individual businesses, the upside from bringing our collective strength to clients, and our restructuring actions, position us well for 2024. Looking to the year ahead, we continue to see a complex macro environment. Major economies continue to face the risk of recession, but moderating inflation and the possibility of easing interest rates make a soft landing more likely. The geopolitical situation remains unsettled, with multiple wars, escalating conflict throughout the Middle East, and rising tension in the South China Sea. Despite these challenges, we continue to believe there are factors that are supportive of growth in our business. Nominal GDP expectations for 2024 remain healthy for our major markets. While inflation has moderated, it is still elevated, and tight labor markets and supply chain challenges persist. Continued low unemployment and sustained payroll growth, support demand in health and benefits and exposure unit growth in workers' compensation. The cost of risk continues to increase as insurers account for rising frequency and severity of catastrophe losses, the risks of social inflation, and higher reinsurance costs. Healthcare costs, driven in part by the rising cost of prescription drugs, accelerated in 2023, and are expected to remain elevated. And while short-term interest rates could ease, they remain at the highest level since the financial crisis. As we've stated before, we have a track record of resilience and performance across economic cycles. Now, let me turn to insurance and reinsurance market conditions. Primary insurance rates increased for the 25th consecutive quarter, with the Marsh Global Insurance Market Index up 2% overall, compared to a 3% increase in the third quarter. Property rates increased 6% versus 7% in the third quarter, and casualty pricing continued to be up low single-digits. Workers' compensation decreased slightly, while financial and professional liability rates were down mid-single-digits. Cyber pricing decreased modestly after several years of increases. In reinsurance, the January 1 renewals reflected a market with more balanced trading conditions than a year ago. As we expected, underwriting discipline continued, but the market was more responsive to client objectives. Capacity was generally adequate, and we saw increased demand from clients. In global property cat reinsurance, accounts without losses saw rates up modestly, while loss-impacted accounts increase between 10% and 30%. Casualty programs faced more scrutiny this year, with pressure on pro-rata seating commissions, and excess of loss pricing. However, casualty capacity was adequate. As always, we're helping our clients navigate these dynamic market conditions. Now, let me briefly turn to our fourth quarter financial performance, which Mark will cover in detail. We generated adjusted EPS of $1.68, which is up 14% versus a year ago. Revenue grew 7% on an underlying basis, with 8% growth in RIS, and 7% in consulting. Overall, in the fourth quarter, we had adjusted operating income growth of 16%, and our adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points year-over-year. In summary, 2023 was another outstanding year for Marsh McLennan. All of our businesses delivered, generating excellent revenue and earnings growth. We executed on our strategic initiatives, invested in high quality acquisitions, made the largest dividend increase in 25 years, and made meaningful share repurchases. Looking forward, we are well positioned for 2024. We expect mid-single-digit or better underlying revenue growth, margin expansion, and strong adjusted EPS growth. Our outlook assumes current macro conditions persist. However, meaningful uncertainty remains, and the economic backdrop could be materially different than our assumptions. With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results.\nMark McGivney: Thank you, John, and good morning. Our strong fourth quarter results capped an excellent year. Our consolidated revenue increased 11% in the fourth quarter to $5.6 billion, with underlying growth of 7%. Operating income was $1.1 billion, and adjusted operating income was $1.2 billion, up 16% from a year ago. Our adjusted operating margin increased 130 basis points to 23.3%. GAAP EPS was $1.52. Adjusted EPS was $1.68, up 14%. Our full year of 2023 results were outstanding. Operating income for the year was $5.3 billion, and adjusted operating income was $5.6 billion, an increase of 17% over 2022. Adjusted EPS grew 17% to $7.99, and our adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points, marking our 16th consecutive year of reported margin expansion. 2023 was also a strong year for capital management. We deployed $4 billion of capital, enhanced our short-term liquidity, raised our quarterly dividend 20%, and saw Moody's (NYSE:MCO) upgrade our senior unsecured debt rating to A3. Looking at risk and insurance services, fourth quarter revenue increased 11% to $3.3 billion, or 8% on an underlying basis. This result marks the 11th consecutive quarter of 8% or higher underlying growth in RIS, and continues the best stretch of growth in two decades. RIS operating income was $753 million in the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating income increased 15% to $791 million, and our adjusted margin expanded 140 basis points to 27%. For the full year, revenue in RIS was $14.1 billion, representing an increase of 11% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income grew 17% for the year, and our adjusted operating margin in RIS increased 150 basis points to 31.3%. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter increased 7% to $2.9 billion, or 6% on an underlying basis. For the full year, revenue at Marsh was $11.4 billion, reflecting underlying growth of 8%. In US and Canada, underlying growth was 5% for the quarter, reflecting solid renewal and new business growth, despite continued headwinds in financial and professional lines. We also saw a headwind of nearly a point from lower flood claims in our MGA business. For the full year, underlying growth in US and Canada was strong at 7%. In international, underlying growth was 7% in the quarter, with Latin America up 11%, Asia Pacific up 10%, and EMEA up 5%. For the full year, underlying growth in international was excellent at 9%. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $252 million, up 9% on an underlying basis, driven by growth across global specialties in most regions. For the year, Guy Carpenter generated $2.3 billion of revenue and 10% underlying growth, our strongest year since 2003. In the consulting segment, fourth quarter revenue was $2.3 billion, up 10% from a year ago, or 7% on an underlying basis. Consulting operating income was $443 million, and adjusted operating income was $480 million, up 18%. Our adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points in the quarter to 21.3%. For the full year, consulting revenue was $8.7 billion, an increase of 7% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income for the year increased 13% to $1.7 billion, and our adjusted operating margin increased 70 basis points to 20.4%. Mercer's revenue was $1.4 billion in the quarter, reflecting underlying growth of 5%. This was Mercer's 11th straight quarter of 5% or higher underlying growth, and continues the best run of growth in 15 years. Health grew 9% in the fourth quarter, reflecting strength in employer and government segments, and momentum across all regions. Wealth was up 4%, driven by growth and investment management and DB administration. Our assets under management were $420 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up 11% sequentially, and up 22% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Year-over-year growth was driven by our transaction with Westpac, a rebound in capital markets, and positive net flows. Career revenue increased 1%, reflecting tough comparables following a period of strong growth in the reward space. For the year, revenue at Mercer was $5.6 billion, an increase of 7% on an underlying basis, the best result since 2008. Oliver Wyman's revenue in the fourth quarter was 856 million, an increase of 9% on an underlying basis, like strength in Europe and the Middle East. For the full year, Oliver Wyman's revenue was $3.1 billion, reflecting underlying growth of 8%. Adjusted corporate expense was $78 million in the quarter. Foreign exchange had very little impact on earnings in the fourth quarter and was a $0.07 headwind for the full year. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX will have a negligible impact on the first quarter and full year of 2024. Total noteworthy items in the quarter were $90 million, the majority of which related to our restructuring actions, partly offset by a $58 million gain related to a legal settlement. We reported $131 million of total restructuring costs, approximately $113 million of which relates to the program we launched in the fourth quarter of 2022. These charges largely reflect costs related to severance, lease exits, and streamlining our technology environment. We expect total charges under this program of approximately $475 million, and expect total savings of roughly $400 million, of which approximately $230 million was realized in 2023. We expect to realize the bulk of the remaining savings in 2024. To date, we've incurred approximately $440 million of charges under this program. Our other net benefit credit was $59 million in the quarter and $239 million for the full year. For 2024, we currently expect our other net benefit credit will be up slightly. Cash contributions to our global defined benefit plans were $111 million in 2023. We expect a similar amount in 2024. Investment income was a loss of $1 million in the fourth quarter on both a GAAP and adjusted basis, and we aren't currently projecting any investment income in the first quarter of 2024. Interest expense in the fourth quarter was $151 million, up from $127 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting higher levels of debt and higher interest rates. Based on our current forecast, we expect interest expense for the full year 2024 of approximately $625 million, with $159 million in the first quarter. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 25.5%. This compares with 22.9% in the fourth quarter last year, which benefited from favorable discrete items. For the full year 2023, our adjusted effective tax rate was 24%, compared with 23.5% in 2022. Both periods benefited from favorable discrete items. When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items, which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, we expect an adjusted effective tax rate of between 25.5% and 26.5% for 2024. Turning to capital management and our balance sheet, we ended the year with total debt of $13.5 billion. Our next scheduled debt maturities are in the first quarter of 2024, when $1 billion of senior notes mature, and in the second quarter when another $600 million of notes come due. Recall that last September we issued $1.6 billion of new debt to fund these maturities. Our cash position at the end of the fourth quarter was $3.4 billion. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled $1.1 billion, and included $354 million for dividends, $486 million for acquisitions, and $250 million for share repurchases. For the year, uses of cash totaled $4 billion and included $1.3 billion for dividends, $1.6 billion for acquisitions, and $1.15 billion for share repurchases. I want to take a minute to reiterate our approach to capital management. We have consistently followed a balanced capital management strategy that helps us deliver solid performance in the near term, while investing for sustained growth over the long term. We prioritize investment in our business, both through organic investments and acquisitions. We favor attractive acquisitions over share repurchases, and believe they are the better value creator for shareholders and the company over the long term. However, we also recognize that returning capital to shareholders generates meaningful returns for investors over time, and each year we target raising our dividend and reducing our share cap. Looking ahead to 2024, based on our outlook today, we expect to deploy approximately $4.5 billion of capital across dividends, acquisitions, and share repurchases. The ultimate level of share repurchase will depend on how the M&A pipeline develops. As John noted, there is significant uncertainty in the outlook for the global economy. However, we feel good about our momentum and position, and despite the uncertainty, there are factors that remain supportive of growth. For 2024, we currently expect mid-single-digit or better underlying revenue growth, margin expansion, and strong growth in adjusted EPS. With that, I'm happy to turn it back to John.\nJohn Doyle: Thank you, Mark. Andrew, we're ready to begin Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, earlier this week, we had another insurance broker who's updating their reported EPS metric to back out intangibles. So, that does leave you guys as the only broker peer, right, that doesn't back out intangibles out of your adjusted EPS figure. Have you guys given consideration to moving towards what's become industry common practice?\nJohn Doyle: Good morning, Elyse. Mark, maybe you could comment on that.\nMark McGivney: Elyse, we don't have any current plans to change our reporting. We do provide amortization and other information that allows you to stack us up against other companies, but we don't plan to change how we report at this point.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. Thanks.\nJohn Doyle: You have a follow-up, Elyse?\nElyse Greenspan: And then my second - yes, my second question. I was hoping to get more color on both the US and Canada and EMEA, which did see growth slow in the quarter. I know Mark alluded to one point headwind from lower flood business within the US and Canada. I wasn't sure if there was anything else to point out in the quarter, and also hoping to get similar color on anything one-off within organic growth within EMEA as well.\nJohn Doyle: Sure, Elyse, and I'll make a couple of comments and then ask Martin to jump in. First of all, Marsh had an excellent year of growth at 8% underlying revenue growth for the year, a strong finish to the year. We saw fourth quarter of 2022 have slightly lower underlying growth as well, but we feel like we're very well positioned. Mark made a few comments about the growth in the quarter, but Martin, maybe you could add a little bit more color.\nMartin South: Yes, thank you, John. As you said, we had a very good year, with 7% growth this year. And Marsh for the quarter at 5% growth, was also the same as the prior year. MMA had an outstanding performance, driven really by great retention new business. Our M&A pipeline is robust. The US business continued to perform well. There's some headwinds in the capital markets activity and pressure on financial minds, but our advisory business grow - it was partially offset by Canada, which is impacted more by macro headwinds. And of course, we mentioned a lot of flood claims in the MGA business. So, in EMEA, we had an excellent year in EMEA, 9% growth. Q4 was 5% growth. The European business within EMEA is the smallest quarter by some margin. And so, it's susceptible to some slowdown in some of the projects, but we had a very strong year, strong quarter in the Middle East, steady results in the UK. And so, that was really it. Nothing remarkable, strong momentum, we'd expect to be very confident going into next year.\nJohn Doyle: Thanks, Martin. So, Elyse, FINPRO pricing, as Mark mentioned, flood claims and the continued slow M&A environment, all factored in in the US, but again, we feel like we're very well positioned and demand is quite strong for us in in 2024. Operator, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with J.P. Morgan.\nJimmy Bhullar: Hey, good morning. So, first, just a question on the reinsurance brokerage business. Obviously, prices this year haven't gone up like they did last year. But what have you seen in terms of terms and conditions and buying behavior? Because last year we saw the primaries retain a lot of risk and attachment points went up. Have those come back down or are like sort of terms and structures programs similar to how they were last year?\nJohn Doyle: Yes, thanks for the question, Jimmy. Guy Carpenter just had an excellent year helping clients navigate what was a very, very choppy market in 2023. We certainly began 2024 with a more orderly market, but growth was outstanding, and I feel terrific about how we're positioned to help clients going forward. But Dean, maybe could share a little bit more insight on the market on 1/1.\nDean Klisura: Sure. Thanks, John. And Jimmy, let me give you a little bit more color on the 1/1 renewal in reinsurance. As John stated, we saw a balanced reinsurance market at the January 1st renewal. Overall capacity was adequate for the completion of most programs across products and classes of business. Capacity did increase given rebounding capital in the marketplace and improved reinsurer returns in 2023. We estimate the dedicated reinsurance capital increased double-digit for the 1/1 renewal. Turning to property cat, which I think you're mainly referring to, as John noted, was more consistent trading rhythm than last year. Capacity overall was adequate to cover most non-frequency cat exposed layers. But as John noted, reinsurers held firm on terms and conditions. Attachment points did not come down. So, reinsurers held on what they achieved in 2023, continuing to expose our clients' balance sheets to attritional volatility moving forward. So, that certainly didn't change. But overall, I thought it was a positive renewal. Clients bought more capacity at the top of cat programs. You saw some of those reported in the marketplace. So, clients were able to get more capacity than last year, achieve their objectives, as John noted. John talked about risk-adjusted rate increases. For clients with non-loss impacted portfolios, they saw a range of flat to high single-digit kind of rate increases, but clients with cat losses were in the 10% to 30% rate increase range, right? So, I think that was pretty robust in both kind of the US and European markets. Maybe a minute on casualty as well. In prior calls, we talked a lot about casualty and increased scrutiny of casualty portfolios heading into the 1/1 renewal. Reinsurers have been expressing concerns about adverse loss development now for several quarters and real and social inflation. However, I would say that at 1/1, that pricing movement was more constrained, slightly more muted than we anticipated kind of earlier in the fourth quarter. That said, as John, as John mentioned, there was downward pressure on seating commissions for quota share contracts. And excess of lost contracts saw double-digit rate increases moving forward. But in the casualty renewal, I would say overall capacity was adequate.\nJohn Doyle: Thanks, Dean. Jimmy, I would add, just in both the insurance and reinsurance market, the pace of loss cost inflation in casualty is the great unknown at the moment. We all know it's increasing. We all see mounting evidence of it, but that's the challenge for all of us in the market to sort through at the moment. Do you have a follow-up, Jimmy?\nJimmy Bhullar: Yes. Just on fiduciary investment income. So, it had been increasing at a pretty sharp rate and declined modestly sequentially. Is that a function of just what's happened with interest rates or something to do with fiduciary balances or seasonality or something else?\nJohn Doyle: Sure. Mark, you want to?\nMark McGivney: Yes. Jimmy, it is seasonality. Our balances tend to have a pattern of seasonality. It results in - Q4 and Q1 tend to be seasonal lows for average balances. So, it's purely a function of that.\nJohn Doyle: Thanks, Jimmy. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Michael Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets.\nMichaelZaremski: Good morning. Back to the organic growth commentary, especially on the brokerage side, you\u2019re loud and clear on kind of some of the pluses and minuses. I didn't hear anything about any influence from maybe a diminishing tailwind from some of the excess hires you've made in past years. Is that a dynamic we should be thinking about as we think about 2024 and 2025?\nJohn Doyle: Yes. Thanks, Mike. No, I don't think so. We continue to invest both organically and inorganically, maybe not that at the pace of a few years ago, but that's an important metric for us that we track around how we're driving production capacity in all of our businesses. So, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we think the macro environment continues to be supportive of growth in our business. Nominal GDP will drive some growth. Inflation, while easing, is still elevated, tight labor markets. We were just talking about the cost of risk in casualty as well. And as a result of that, we think pricing in the market will maintain - will remain relatively stable as it's been really throughout most of 2023. So, we\u2019re quite optimistic about 2024. Our outlook is positive. I would also say a couple of other things. We're a better business entering 2024. We've been working hard at that. Our mix continues to improve. I talked about that a little bit about some of the divestiture activity, but also the inorganic investment we made. And we'll continue to invest organically in the business as well, and demand remains strong. So, we're excited about 2024.\nMichaelZaremski: Understood. And my follow-up, switching gears a little bit to Mercer. In your prepared remarks, I think you made, John, some comments about medical or health inflation. Some of the data points we've seen are - the medical costs for employers should - might accelerate in 2024. Should that have a tailwind or any influence on the health segment specifically? Thanks.\nJohn Doyle: Sure. Health was a terrific story for us in 2023, and helping employers navigate what's a very, very complex and increasing cost environment will be very much on the top of our agenda in 2024 as well. Maybe, Martine, I'll ask you to comment a little bit about how we finished the year and what your outlook is around health for 2024.\nMartine Ferland: Yes. Thanks, John, and thanks, Mike, for the question. We're very pleased with the results in health, and we have had a quarter of 9% a year of 10 in overall health, and it comes from all regions, and it comes from many places. Of course, full employment does drive good results there, more people to cover in our employers\u2019 benefit programs. But we also have invested in innovative and adaptive solutions. And medical cost inflation is there, and what it drives for us is a lot of consulting around trying to help clients and their employees control costs by better design, better fit for purpose programs. So, we'll see. There's not a huge portion of our business that is actually directly linked to inflation. We have a lot of fee-based revenue in the business. So, usually, whether there's a lot of inflation or inflation abates a little bit is not a big factor in the overall results. I think it's more around access to healthcare, innovative form of healthcare, like digital health, mental health, good affordability for clients and their employees. That's mostly driving our business results.\nJohn Doyle: Thanks, Martine. Andrew, next question, please.\nOperator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Motemaden: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I had a question just on Oliver Wyman, and I know a few quarters ago, we spoke about the pipeline that had slowed a little bit, but growth has remained pretty resilient there. I'm wondering if you could just talk about some of the drivers there within Oliver Wyman for organic. And we've seen a few more - a little bit more activity on the life insurance transaction side, just M&A activity. Is that something that's been an outside driver to results?\nJohn Doyle: Yes, thanks, David. Oliver Wyman had a terrific year, and as we all recall, we had a flat start to 2023. So, demand continued to pick up and sales continued to pick up throughout the course of the year, and we had a real strong finish. But Nick, maybe you could share a bit more color on what drove the growth and your outlook a bit.\nNick Studer: Thank you, David, for the question. Yes, 12 months ago, we were coming off a pretty strong year, but we knew the first quarter was going to be tough. And looking back on the year, it was indeed a pretty tough marketplace for many of our competitors and for the industry, and we're very proud of clawing back from that slow start to a strong year. It was pretty wide-based growth. As Mark mentioned in his prepared remarks, our Middle East business grew very strongly, had excellent growth in Europe. We had strong growth in our economic research capabilities, as well as in digital, in finance and risk. Some of our other capabilities grew, our people and organizational performance capability. And I've mentioned a few times that we've been building a restructuring practice. It's still not a big restructuring cycle, but that practice continues to grow very strongly. And across the industry is, again, broad-based growth in the public sector, which is a strong practice for us, particularly in the Middle East. Some good growth in banking. You mentioned life insurance and consolidation. We have a strong insurance practice. We've seen a lot more activity in post-merger integration and M&A across our sectors. And then our transportation and services and our communications media and technology practices also grew strongly. And I think it's off the base of just good hiring, good organic growth, and also some good inorganic growth. We've made a number of acquisitions over the last few years. We announced one which we hope to complete in the next couple of months, and both great partner level hires and M&A are helping fuel that growth as well. So, the business is now 50% bigger than it was three years ago. That scale, that breadth, allows us to play in more places, allows us to help our clients with their big transformative moments.\nJohn Doyle: Thank you, Nick. And David, I would add, Oliver Wyman is just one of the ways in which we can show up in a very, very different way in front of clients and prospects. And so, we have a unique collection of capabilities, certainly with them and the family. Do you have a follow-up, David?\nDavid Motemaden: I do, yes. Thanks for that. Just a bigger picture question. I just sort of look over the last decade or the decade pre-pandemic, Marsh as an enterprise has grown organically in the 3% to 5% range, and we've obviously been well above that over the last three years, including 9% here in 2023. There've been a number of tailwinds, but you guys have also been investing in the business. So, I'm wondering if you think we can sustainably grow above that 3% to 5% organic growth we saw in the decade pre-pandemic as we think about the next several years.\nJohn Doyle: Yes, thanks, David. As I said just a couple of minutes ago, I think we're a better business entering 2024 than we were in 2023. I thought we were an outstanding business leading into 2023, but we've been working hard at being a better growth business for many years now. Part of that's reshaping the mix of business. As we've talked about, investing organically and inorganically. We've spent a lot of time refining our client engagement models and investing in sales operations and technology to support sales. And of course, in 2019, we made the biggest acquisition in our history with JLT. So, we were building up these capabilities going into 2020 when, of course, the pandemic hit. So, I knew we were ready to run coming out of the pandemic. The macro environment, of course, has been supportive since the pandemic. And as I mentioned earlier, we expect the macros to continue to be supportive in in 2024. So, we think we're well positioned. As I mentioned earlier, we expect mid single-digit revenue growth or better. So, we're excited and quite optimistic heading into the year. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Cox with Goldman Sachs.\nRobert Cox: Hey, thanks for taking my question. So, just curious if you could give us some more color on any changes in the middle market operating environment in particular, and anything you guys are thinking about in terms of competitive dynamics as some large peers enter this space in a bigger way.\nJohn Doyle: I think you could ask Aon (NYSE:AON) about NFP. I'm happy to talk about our middle market offering. I believe we have the best-in-class middle market US platform in MMA. It has been 12 years that we've been building our business here in the United States. And we've been building it out methodically and I\u2019m very, very proud of it. We love competition. And so, I'll take our team in the market, but we're excited about our prospects at MMA. And candidly, I think we're just getting started. And when we began this effort 12 years ago, there were 30,000 independent agents in the United States, and today there are 30,000 independent agents in the United States. So, there's much more in front of us. Do you have a follow-up?\nRobert Cox: That's great. Yes. So, just for a follow-up, maybe going back to the health space, I think you guys have discussed how you're largely compensated on a fee per employee basis, and employment growth is much lower than the 9% organic you achieved in the quarter. So, I was just wondering if you could help me understand, is this more consulting, new business opportunities out there? Are you raising fees and maybe is brokerage growing at a similar pace to the headline 9% organic?\nJohn Doyle: Yes. it's I think all of the above, but good sales and a value proposition to clients and prospects that they appreciate very much. I don't know, Martine, do you have anything to add to that?\nMartine Ferland: Yes. Well, first a correction. The large part of our business is actually consulting fees. It's not fees per member, as you mentioned, Robert. So, just to be clear about that. There's a small portion of the business in the US that is fee per participant, but that's the business that we divested. It's more in a (NIM) business. It\u2019s how those businesses are usually paid out. So, the bulk of our business, some of it is based on the commission, but as I said, clients are really trying to control costs. So, there's not a direct link to inflation in premium there, because they would change the attachment point, as my colleagues in reinsurance like to talk about. They would vary the benefit programs, et cetera. And there's a large part that is project-based. And to your point, our growth has been in part full employment because there's much more work to be done to cover the employee population. But there's also a lot of change. High cost of prescription drugs, for example, accessibility through different means, technology coming into the space to help out people choose the right providers, the right programs, and we're there with them helping them design those programs, communicate them to employees, measure them in terms of efficacy, but also cost, et cetera. So, that's what's been - and you know that the health space everywhere is also seeing lots of change, lots of pressure on cost. So, I don't see us being not busy anytime soon. Nothing climbs through that.\nJohn Doyle: Thank you, Martine. Thank you, Robert. Andrew, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW.\nMeyer Shields: Great, thank you. Two quick questions. First, can you give us a sense of the seasonality of the reinsurance acquisition that contributed so much to this quarter's growth?\nJohn Doyle: Mark, maybe you can?\nMark McGivney: Meyer, what you're seeing - I think you're referring to the underlying growth schedule and what looks like a large acquisition in Guy Carpenter, is actually that column is acquisitions, dispositions, and other adjustments. And we had a - in my prepared remarks, I mentioned a legal settlement that we had, a noteworthy item in the quarter. So, that's what's running through that schedule. It wasn't a large - not M&A for Guy Carpenter.\nMeyer Shields: Oh, okay. Thank you.\nJohn Doyle: You have a follow-up, Meyer?\nMeyer Shields: Yes, a quick one. When you've got the flood claims revenues in last year's I guess US and Canada operations with risk and insurance services, did that have any impact on last year's margins or the year-over-year progress?\nJohn Doyle: Well, we don't report margins by business, but you saw a good margin expansion during the course of the year. And again, our outlook for 2024 is for 17th year in a row to expand margins yet again. So, it wasn't material. We managed through it. There are parts of our business that are lumpy, right? That's why we caution everybody not to get too worked up about growth rates in a particular quarter. And the flood claim activity was largely related to Hurricane Ian-related work that we did at that time last year. Thank you, Meyer. Andrew, next question, please.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith (NYSE:MDP) with UBS.\nBrian Meredith: Hey, thanks, John. Just quickly and kind of following on Rob's question a little bit. If we look at the middle market space, there are some kind of larger competitors of yours that are going through some transitions, be it being acquired, maybe being acquired, not sure, all sorts of stuff. Is that creating maybe another opportunity here for you to kind of ramp up talent acquisition? You obviously were really successful a couple of years ago doing that. Is that opportunity out there you think again?\nJohn Doyle: Yes. Look, Brian, what I would say first and foremost about talent acquisition is that we are very, very focused. I mentioned this in my prepared remarks about building a culture that attracts and retains the best in our work. The way we frame it, and we talk about being at your best at Marsh McLennan, right? How can we - for those that want to commit their career to risk strategy and people-related work, how is it that being at Marsh McLennan, you can be your best? And we frame those programs around learning and development, mobility, various aspects of wellness. And you get to do really purposeful work here. I mentioned the Ukraine work as an example earlier. You get to work with exceptional talent, and it's a collaborative environment and a learning environment. And so, I feel like we have the best talent in our business. I feel like our brand as an employer in the market is very, very strong. It doesn't mean everybody wants to work here. Of course, we're a big company and as we all know, there's lots of things that come with working at a bigger company. But I like how we're positioned. So, M&A, yes. Does it create opportunities for talent acquisition? Much like - we saw a bit of talent breakage when we acquired JLT. Folks sign up for working at a certain place, and when you have that kind of change, it's an opportunity possibly for folks to think through what they want to do going forward. I like how we're positioned in that respect. And then back to your other comment, yes, there are a number of bigger businesses, particularly in the risk space that are likely to change hands over time.\nBrian Meredith: Great, thanks. And then I guess my next question, could you talk a little bit about kind of the M&A environment, particularly in the risk business, multiples being paid, what the pipeline kind of looks like there, more competitive, less competitive.\nJohn Doyle: Yes, thanks, Brian. We remain very active in the market. As I said earlier, last year was our biggest year of acquisitions, other than 2019 when we did JLT, over a long period of time. We're very selective. We\u2019re looking for high performing businesses, well led businesses in attractive markets. As I mentioned, we want growth businesses with the ability to grow earnings as well. The three bigger deals that I highlighted in my prepared remarks, we're very excited about Honan in Australia. It gives us really an anchor platform deeper into the middle market in what's a very important and attractive market for us. Graham here in the United States, another step forward for us at MMA and then BT Westpac in Australia, strengthening our wealth business. So, we have a couple of deals that we announced in the later part of last year. Vanguard's OCIO operation, a career business, those will close sometime over the next the next few months. So, we're going to continue to be active. Much like I was talking about our brand as an employer, our brand as a buyer is also quite strong, right? We do what we say we're going to do. And so - and then on valuations, four really attractive assets. Their multiples remain high. And so, anyway, but we'll continue to deploy capital that way. And as Mark mentioned, we'd rather deploy capital on attractive inorganic and organic investment for that matter over share buybacks. But in the course of a year, you never know how things will run. But the pipeline is quite strong at the moment. Thank you, Brian. Andrew, next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman with TD Cowen.\nAndrew Kligerman: Hey, good morning. John, you talked about the great unknown in terms of loss cost inflation, social inflation. On the flip side, we've seen a few carriers report, and their results have been exceptional. So, I understand that you're kind of projecting out some good pricing, but at what point does that give and take ratio change and we kind of see some softer pricing, and how would that affect Marsh?\nJohn Doyle: So, look, as I've said a couple of times on this call, we've been working very hard at becoming a better growth business. We're not an index on P&C pricing. Of course, we're exposed to it. And just to be clear, I wasn't trying to project higher casualty prices over time. Our job is to get the most efficient risk financing as we can for our clients. But what I can tell you is, it is quite clear that there's stress emerging in casualty. There's no question about it. There are some casualty cats that are out there that are concerning to underwriters and buyers, and we're just seeing greater frequency of mega settlements, and for that matter, even judgements on individual cases. Core inflation, of course, is something that's always a factor in the market. And you see that - you've seen some of that manifest itself in shorter tail lines from carriers. But we're all quite concerned inside of our risk business about where casualty loss costs are headed.\nAndrew Kligerman: Thanks for that one. And then my second question is just the stellar growth, underlying growth in Asia Pacific at 10%, LATAM at 11% in risk and insurance services. Question is, what particularly you seeing in those markets that is driving some of that excellent growth? And then underlying that, what is Marsh doing differently from the competitors?\nJohn Doyle: Yes. I mean, we're very proud of our businesses in both of those regions. They've been growth leaders for us over the last several years. I would point out, it's one of the things that JLT brought to us in 2019. We expanded our footprint and brought along much greater distribution in both Latin America and Asia. But Martin, maybe you could talk a little bit more about both of those regions.\nMartin South: Yes, as you say, I mean, we\u2019re the clear market leader by some margin in Asia-Pac. There's several factors. We have literally market leadership in every single major geography there. We are able to bring all of our best capabilities from around the world to there. We have great teams, very specialized, a very strong employee benefits business. We have scale. We're able to attract and retain talent in a way - there's just - there's real momentum there. And the same can be said in Latin America. Slightly different economic dynamics, obviously, with Latin America. A big protection gap. A lot of opportunities market leadership in the areas there, and still quite an unconsolidated marketplace. So, we like the fact that we built our businesses organically, so the cultures are strong. There's not much on the M&A pipeline in those markets that we like. We are confident that we can build our businesses organically. And the differentiation of having global service and our global capabilities is really well sought out to by our clients.\nJohn Doyle: Yes, thanks, Andrew, and Martin, for that. We continue to be excited about how we're positioned in those markets. Andrew, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bob Huang with Morgan Stanley.\nBob Huang: Hi. I only have one major question. So, this regarding MMA. So, just curious, how much did MMA contribute to the overall revenue for 2023? And as we move into 2024, how should we think about the trajectory for MMA? Is it like, should we continue to expect it to further outgrow the broader business as a whole, or how should we think about just the competitive dynamic overall as well?\nJohn Doyle: So, we obviously don't separately report MMA's results, but it's an important part of our business in the United States, and it continues to perform exceptionally well. We couldn't be more pleased, as I mentioned earlier. And as I also said, I think we're just getting started, right? So, and what I would also say is that the broader Marsh has learned a great deal from MMA about what it takes to win in the middle market. And Martin and the team apply those lessons as we expand in the middle market all over the world and where possible even deploy inorganic investment like we did in in the case of Honan in Australia. But our business at MMA also benefits from being part of Marsh. They're excellent at really mining Marsh for content and capability that can enable them to show up with scale in local markets in a way that really distinguishes themselves from others. So, as I mentioned earlier, we've been methodically building out MMA over the course of the last 12 years piece by piece and A+ asset by A+ asset. And so, we couldn't be more excited, and we think there's a long road ahead of us. Do you have a follow-up, Bob?\nBob Huang: No, I think I'm good. Thank you.\nJohn Doyle: Okay. Thank you, Andrew. Next question, please.\nOperator: One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ward with Citi.\nMichael Ward: Thanks, guys. Good morning. Just on the capital deployment target, I think it was up over 10%. I was just wondering if that's a function of the cost savings program rolling off or anything else.\nJohn Doyle: No, but Mark, maybe you could just talk generally about our approach.\nMark McGivney: We had a, if you saw, a strong year of free cash flow generation. We have significant financial flexibility. Our balance sheet is strong. And so, it's just really a reflection of the growth in our outlook for capital - cash generation.\nMichael Ward: Okay. And then any kind of update on the progress with synergizing the various business sales efforts together?\nJohn Doyle: Yes, thanks, Mike, for that question. One of the things that I think makes us a better business is we're working better together than we ever have, right? And we have shared with you where we are on the expense side of things, but we're showing up together in front of clients and prospects. As I mentioned earlier, the strength of our individual business propositions will continue to drive the growth of our business overall. But more and more, we can show up in a very, very unique way. And so, we made good progress during 2023. We've certainly learned a great deal. We've done some testing, and we'll continue to refine that. But we have a number of global growth opportunities where we're showing up in front of clients and prospects together. And what we really did was create a framework for our folks in the field. As you'll recall, we appointed Marsh McLennan leaders in each of the regions. And so, a big part of their day is making sure that we're bringing our collective capabilities to market at a local level where it makes sense. So, we continue to be excited about what that'll mean to future growth.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan, for any closing remarks.\nJohn Doyle: Thanks, Andrew, and I want to thank you all for joining us on the call this morning. In closing, I want to thank our colleagues for their hard work and dedication. I also want to thank our clients for their continued support. Thank you all very much, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor. For more information see our T&C."

        "article_content": " \n\nMarine Products Corporation (NYSE: NYSE:MPX), a leading manufacturer of fiberglass boats, reported a decline in financial performance for the fourth quarter of 2023, with net sales falling 35% to $70.9 million compared to the same period last year. The company's diluted earnings per share (EPS) also decreased to $0.16, a drop from the previous year's $0.51. Despite the downturn, Marine Products ended the year with a strong balance sheet, including over $70 million in cash and no debt, and expressed optimism about the future as they adjust production to align with current demand and explore potential acquisitions.\nMarine Products Corporation emphasized their commitment to aligning production with market demand and leveraging their strong dealer network for growth.

Today's call will be hosted by Ben Palmer, President and CEO; and Mike Schmit, Chief Financial Officer. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time for you to queue up for questions. I would like to advise everyone that this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Schmidt.\nMike Schmit: Thank you, and good morning. Before we begin, I want to remind you that some of the statements that will be made on this call could be forward-looking in nature and reflect a number of known and unknown risks. Please refer to our press release issued today along with our 2022 10-K and other public filings that outline those risks. All of which can be found at www.marineproductscorp.com. In today's earnings call and in our press release, we'll be referring to several non-GAAP measures of operating performance and liquidity. We believe these non-GAAP measures allow us to compare performance consistently over various periods. Our press release issued today and our website contain reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Ben Palmer.\nBen Palmer: Thank you, and good morning. Before we begin, I want to remind you that some of those -- apologize. Appreciate everybody joining the call this morning. Our fourth quarter results reflect the ongoing normalization of retail boat sales as the multi-year post-COVID consumer demand boost subsides. In response to this slowdown, we have adjusted production to meet current order patterns as the retail channel works through excess inventory. We believe we are now in a steady balance of production and sales. However, our fourth quarter results showed significant declines versus the prior year. The difficult year-over-year comparisons are likely to persist near term. In the meantime, we will focus on making sound operational and financial decisions to position the company for sustainable long-term growth. First and foremost, we believe our current production and shipment schedule, together with our incentive programs, should now facilitate a net reduction in dealer inventories. While still early, we are seeing an order flow that would justify a step up in production later during the first quarter. So that is an encouraging sign as we start the calendar year and get positive feedback from recent purchase. With regard to dealer inventory, I'd say we're comfortable with the level of our products in the field, as we were disciplined in not pushing too much product into the channel. However, we do get the sense the dealer inventories overall are a bit high. To stimulate buying, we've returned to a historically normal level of retail incentives, which had been minimal these past few years. We launched a program in the fourth quarter to move dealer inventory, and we see other manufacturers doing the same. Mike will comment further on promotional activities as fourth quarter results reflected an outsized impact re-initiating these programs. We've talked previously about economic uncertainty and the new reality of higher interest rates. Rates not only affect the monthly payments for consumers who finance their boats, but also dealers carrying cost of inventory. The interest rate outlook remains somewhat unclear, and we hope more clarity on the direction of rates and the magnitude of possible rate cuts will help consumers get more comfortable. Despite a choppy environment we will remain focused on areas of the business within our control. We will continue to invest in R&D to support new innovative features, products, and design improvements to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace. For example, we are delivering premium interior materials, as well as showcasing additional safety and comfort benefits. We believe our reputation for innovation and product leadership has helped us maintain our leading market share over the years. Second, we are very pleased with our existing dealer network and believe we have room to grow in that infrastructure. Rather than dilute our existing dealers by pursuing overlapping or competitive distribution, we see opportunities to strengthen existing relationships even further. We recently hosted our most intensive dealer training conferences yet, arming them with our latest selling and customer education tools. We are committed to consistently elevating our partnerships with them, positioning Chaparral and Robalo for continued success in their showrooms. We also conducted more advanced technical and repair training for dealer service personnel. We received incredible feedback from these events, and we look forward to sharing in our dealer success as a result of these collaborative efforts. Another investment we're making is selective automation of our plants. We are increasingly using robotics on certain tasks to leverage the skill of our craftsmen and reduce unnecessary fiscal demands. This drives a safer production environment and allows our workers to focus on areas that drive maximum quality and consistency. In addition to investments inside our facilities, we have a significant solar panel installation slated for later this year. Beyond the environmental benefits of using alternative energy sources, we expect this project to drive some cash savings. This [equipped] (ph) will have the capability to supply a sizable portion of our energy needs at our national Georgia manufacturing site. So before turning the call over, I just reiterate that we are confident in our opportunities to invest in the business and that we'll focus on preserving as much margin as possible as we continue to assess the demands of our environment. Now, Mike will provide an overview of the financial results.\nMike Schmit: Thanks, Ben. I'll start with a few quick financial highlights for the year and then go into some more detail about the fourth quarter. For the full year, 2023, net sales were $384 million, up slightly versus last year. Deluded EPS was $1.21, up $0.3. And EBITDA was down 4% to $52 million. We generated strong operating and free cashflow in 2023. Operating cashflow was $57 million, and after CapEx of $10 million, free cash flow was $47 million for the year. CapEx included investments in warehouses and some new trailers. During the year, we paid $19 million in dividends, and we finished 2023 with cash of $72 million and no debt. Now I'll cover our fourth quarter results with year-over-year comparisons to the fourth quarter of 2022. Net sales fell 35% to $70.9 million, driven by a 34% decrease in boat sold. The average gross selling price of our boats increased by 4%, which reflected changes in mix, as well as increases to cover higher input cost. However, this came as a offset by increased retail incentives recorded during the quarter. As Ben mentioned, during the quarter we launched a new retail incentive program, which applies to boats we sold to dealers during the quarter, as well as boats that remained in our dealers' inventories that we had shipped in prior quarters. While the program had a relatively minor top line impact, there was a more noticeable impact on our gross margin. Gross profit decreased 51% to $13.5 million with a gross margin of 19% or down 620 basis points. While gross profit and margin would have fallen due to the decline in boats sold, the reduction was exacerbated in the quarter by the incentive program launch. The fourth quarter retail incentive program represented nearly $2 million reduction in net sales and gross profit, equating to about one-third of the 620 basis point contractions. Furthermore, the majority of the incentives related to boats shipped to dealers in prior quarters. Now that we have normalized incentives and have also adjusted our production schedule to align with current demand, we expect less significant quarterly impacts and better gross margins going forward. SG&A expenses were $7.7 million in the quarter, down 38% or $4.8 million compared to last year. These expenses decreased due to costs that vary with sales and profitability, such as incentive compensation, sales commissions, and warranty expense. Diluted EPS was $0.16 in the fourth quarter, down $0.35 in the same quarter last year. EBITDA was down 58% to $6.5 million, with EBITDA margin decreasing 490 basis points to 9.2%. Year-over-year comparisons are likely to be challenging for the next couple of quarters. But while we don't give explicit financial guidance, directionally, we believe sequential volume and sales changes will be relatively stable in the near term, and that our cost reduction activities and normalized incentives should support gross margin improvements going forward. I'll now turn it back over to Ben for a few closing remarks.\nBen Palmer: Thank you, Mike. In closing, I'd like to mention capital allocation and make a couple of strategic comments. First, we have maintained our attractive $0.14 per share quarterly cash dividend for our shareholders. We have a sound financial profile and believe our compelling dividend yield offers investors an attractive, tangible capital return. Next, while the second half of 2023 had some challenges, it was still a solid full year, which we generated $47 million of free cash flow. We ended the year with no debt and a highly liquid balance sheet with over $70 million in cash. One of the benefits of being conservative and disciplines during recent market buoyancy is that, as the tide turns, we are well positioned to invest prudently and opportunistically. Silver lining of the current soft environment may be an increasing willingness of private boat makers to seek an exit. Our discipline has caused us to pass on transaction and elevated valuations on peak earnings since recent years. It has resulted in a cash accumulation that we are looking to deploy. We are targeting complementary, high-quality boat manufacturers that would enhance our distribution of brand portfolio and increase our marketing capabilities and manufacturing capabilities. And we're very interested in increasing our scale and positioning ourselves as a buyer of choice in the M&A landscape. While difficult to pinpoint timing, it is fair to say that we do not identify -- if we do not identify significant investment opportunities, we're likely to continue our longstanding practice of returning capital to shareholders. So before we turn the call over to questions, I'd like to thank our employees for a great year of commitment and dedication. We wholeheartedly believe we have some of the best boat makers in the industry, and their teamwork and pride underpin Chaparral's and Robalo's success. We received good feedback and orders from recent boat shows, and we're looking forward to showcasing our new products in the coming weeks. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question come from the line of Brandon Rolle with D.A. Davidson. Brandon, the floor is yours.\nBrandon Rolle: All right. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I guess first, just on the production and where it is right now. Could you talk about your production levels, your plan for that over the next three months compared to maybe where it was last year? And you had talked about inventory levels, you were comfortable with your inventory in the field, but overall was a little high. Would you be able to comment on areas where you felt like in the industry, inventories might be a little elevated?\nBen Palmer: Well, again, good morning, Brandon. Probably in terms of our current production level, we adjusted kind of during the third and fourth quarter, so it's probably easier or better to talk about kind of where we go from here relative to the fourth quarter. So, we indicated here that the early results of the boat shows have been consistent to maybe slightly positive to last year. We've had some shows that have had some negative weather, so it was sort of hard to get a read -- an appropriate read on activity levels and so forth. But we're generally pleased with how the early results of the boat shows are coming through. We indicated, or I indicated in my comments, that with some of that recent -- some of the recent orders we've had an indications from dealers, we think we'll be increasing production slightly in the first quarter of next year, but we kind of adjusted it down to where during the fourth quarter that we think is an appropriate rate where we could again assess demand, watch demand, and then we'll adjust production accordingly as we move forward. So we're hopeful and expect with this -- with our retail program and retail incentive programs of other manufacturers that dealer inventory will clear out and it'll make room for us to increase production further as the year goes forward. And with respect to field inventory, I think it's been documented that some of the other segments of our industry have maybe slowed down a little bit sooner than our segment of the market. It took us a little bit -- we benefited from the really strong demand that we had for our products. So I think some of the aluminum products, I think, have experienced some more inventory than they would want to have. So I'd say that's the primary area.\nBrandon Rolle: Okay, great. And you had mentioned the boat show performance is being slightly positive or encouraging at least. What were you specifically seeing at these boat shows in terms of attendance or retail sales or was it a combination of both that gave you guys a more positive view on the space moving forward?\nBen Palmer: I think it's both of those things, right? You get a feel just seeing the attendance, the number of people and getting a sense for the excitement. Of course, the tangible measure is orders that are placed at the show. And like I said, we had similar or in some cases, slightly better sales than a year ago. And a year ago things were still relatively positive. So we take that as a good sign, but we're certainly not going to move production up until we have firm indications of orders from our dealers. So we're constantly assessing that.\nMike Schmit: And I'll just add that, that's really -- that comment was referring to a lot of the boat shows here in the south, because I think in the northwest, northeast, especially, there was a lot of negative impact due to weather. So we're sort of discounting that. I mean, the fact that they didn't have great attendance in the northeast, northwest, because the weather is something that really -- we're not really considering that as indicative of what's going on in the market. But, we attended the Atlanta boat show, for instance. I was at there last show, I was there this year, and the crowds were the same, if not a little bit better. And what we heard from our dealers has been mentioned was that, things definitely are about the same, if not slightly better than last year. So -- and we were in a great place last year. So we were very encouraged by that.\nBrandon Rolle: Okay, great. And then on your new retail incentive program, could you dig in a little deeper on, are these incentives going to the dealers on just like helping out with -- are they wholesale incentives or are they retail incentives as well or a combination of both?\nBen Palmer: What we announced and talked about today and discussed the impact is a retail program. It's a program that we work with the dealers to be able to offer to retail consumers at boat shows and in the showrooms. And of course, the impact on the fourth quarter and the program started late in the fourth quarter and it's still in effect. So we were required, of course, for the accounting purpose to record what we think the estimate of -- an estimate of the cost of that retail incentive program on sales that had already been recorded. So that's where we talked about the fact that our gross margin this quarter was significantly impacted because we had to record an estimate of how much we thought we would pay out in retail incentives for all the boats we've sold up to this point, that are still in dealer inventory. So it's an estimate, as we always do with those types of programs. But it's significant and we think it will encourage retail buyers to order and that'll filter through to additional dealer orders to restock their inventory. So that's the idea. So it's just a little more normalized. It's not outsized. It's not huge. It's really more normal. If you go back kind of pre-COVID days.\nMike Schmit: Yeah, I'll just add that, to kind of answer your other question. It is a combination of both. There's incentives to both the dealers and some that flow through to retail, but it's called a Float Your Boat incentive, and you can read more about it on our Robalo and Chaparral websites. There's a lot of information on those websites about it.\nBrandon Rolle: Okay, great. And just given where inventories are at in the current retail demand, I guess, how much destocking do you feel like needs to take place in the industry to really get back to normalized production levels?\nBen Palmer: That's a difficult question. I'll just answer it by saying, I mean, to quantify it is difficult. What we do, our process is, we work with our dealers, we have periodic order points during the year that go to our dealers. They're looking at their inventory levels. And together with us, we decide what's an appropriate number of boats that need to be delivered over time so that they have sufficient inventory to meet their retail demand, right? Nobody wants to miss out on a sale. So you need to have, it helps to have inventory on hand to be able to meet that -- the buyers that walk in the door that are ready to execute. So we're working with the dealers. We're obviously watching the boat shows. We'll have another order point coming up in the next few weeks. We're getting some early indication that says they're pleased with movement in their inventory. So we're very disciplined in that regard, in terms of making sure that we're aligning production with actual demand and dealer inventory. Certainly, you have to make a projection about what you're going to need in the future, but it helps if sales accelerate. And right now, we're seeing some of that. So that should be positive and we would expect and hope to be able to increase production again later this quarter to be able to support some spring and summer sales as well to bring inventory even down even further.\nBrandon Rolle: Okay, great. And then --\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird.\nBen Palmer: Operator, Brandon may have been cut off there. Can you check?\nOperator: Oh, sorry. My apologies. One moment. We're going to take a question from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird. Craig, the floor is yours.\nCraig Kennison: Oh sure, thanks a lot. [Multiple Speakers] Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Yes, I wanted to touch, I guess, on affordability in a different way. You mentioned some of the promotions that you've got, but I'm wondering if you foresee any changes to product mix or just any change in the product itself in order to target more affordable prices. How important is that?\nBen Palmer: Well, I think it's a great question. At this point in time, we're not taking any definitive measures, always trying to create the best -- the balance between the best quality and the features and the benefits and the cost of the boat. That's always a challenge and something we're working on. But if you go back to -- we in the past have been responsive to those kind of shifts in consumer demand, arcing back to kind of the 2008, 2009, 2010 timeframe. We came out with the H2O series, which was a lower cost unit. We were able to go through and do some sign changes and work with our vendors and we were able to come out with a product that appealed to the consumer at that period of time and in that point in the economic cycle. At this point, we still feel that we have sufficient demand on the products that we have, but we're certainly watching that closely and we'll make the adjustments as necessary. But right now, today, we're not doing anything in particular. Of course, we have a fairly wide range of boat sizes and features and benefits. And to answer the question another way, we're still seeing our more expensive boats carry the most weight with respect to our results. We do sell a lot of our -- we do sell a high volume of our smaller boats, which do, obviously, carry a lower price point, but at this point we are not -- we don't believe that we have the need or we've not seen the need to try to adjust the product configuration or the options and that sort of thing to lower the price. But it's a good question. At some point, that may occur.\nMike Schmit: Yes, I'll just add really quick, too. We haven't really seen a decline in any of our input costs. In fact, on the contrary, they still kind of going up slightly. So you've seen a little bit of margin erosions. So we hope now that supply chains are stabilizing that things will work down, because that's the tough thing too with the supply chain and the input cost of boats has really increased. So the higher price of boats have really reflected that in the whole industry.\nCraig Kennison: Great, thank you. And then I think you had mentioned your strong balance sheet and the desire to expand the portfolio if acquisition opportunities become available. I'm curious where you see, I guess, holes in your portfolio or opportunities to expand your portfolio, are there boat categories where you have particular interest?\nBen Palmer: Yeah, when we think about -- so many factors that go into that decision. Certainly, we want a good company, a good manufacturer, a quality manufacturer. We certainly want to do something that's complementary. We don't want to overlap significantly somebody that we could leverage our really strong and dealer network that would appeal to that dealer network. Obviously, we don't have an aluminum product. That's something that I think would be attractive to us and attractive to our dealer network. We have the opportunity to leverage that and create some benefits. And then on the fiberglass side, certainly in terms of sizes, we could do some larger boats. I don't know that our first choice would be to go significantly larger, but we think we're nicely positioned in the offshore market, perhaps a larger offshore brand. That would probably be the two primary ones that I think, again, would both allow us to leverage our dealer network and utilize some of the cash that we have, and take advantage of the fact that we are able to generate a lot of cash. So we do want to invest that prudently. And again, as we indicated, if we're not able to find something, we'll return cash to shareholders in some form or fashion.\nMike Schmit: And more specifically on the aluminum pontoons, is one that we see a lot of progress that would be -- there's recent -- in recent months demand slowed, but just kind of historically over the last five, 10 years demand for pontoons seems to be increasing at a higher rate than the rest of the industry. So that's a very interesting area.\nCraig Kennison: Thank you. And just looking at your balance sheet, a lot of cash, no debt. How much debt are you willing to take on while you're still comfortable with your cash flow profile?\nBen Palmer: We are \u201cNot afraid of debt\u201d. And we would have other options. Obviously, we could raise equity through secondary, so forth. But we have sales today over the last 12 months, approaching $400 million. So I think we could easily, just to pick a number, I mean, we could -- $100 million or $200 million I think would not be a problem with our balance sheet and our cash flow generating capability and adding a quality company that's generating cash itself, it would not be a problem at all to initially fund an acquisition if it needed to be funded with cash. Or depend on the size of the acquisition, right, that we were doing. But $100 million or $200 million would not be a problem.\nCraig Kennison: Great. Hey, thank you.\nBen Palmer: Thank you, Greg.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to our CEO, Ben Palmer.\nBen Palmer: Okay. Well, thank you very much, everyone, for being on the call, and look forward to catching up with you later. Take care.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor. For more information see our T&C."
